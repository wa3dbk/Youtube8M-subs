00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.100
 and everyone to my house 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.550
 with youtube friends as they are here 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 9001 because we work with both bombo c's 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.419
 or boombox and well we have what 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 does is we add our own stereo 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.140
 our own dozens and besides that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.149
 they add our remote control by 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 if we are not close to what is this 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.440
 of this hype c's well we're going 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.640
 away from him and we can turn him on and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 well let's see how it turns on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 bombo c's so that we approach this 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.739
 stereo we give you right click on it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.420
 will appear us doing here is born 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.089
 we choose our music that we can see 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.159
 here I just have one that is the one from 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.659
 comes with this mode but well we give 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.790
 Right click on the equipment we put 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.950
 play 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.070
 and well, here it will start to sound like 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.690
 can see what those screens are 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.990
 we are going to make that pledge is see 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.030
 there he is and as a man he listens 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.650
 pretty good but good long movies I 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.940
 I think they are ornaments because if you have 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 what is the stereo is only heard 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.520
 same so the horns are of ornament 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.520
 more cool this good roll 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.080
 Well, let's pay for this song and as 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.820
 He has told us he does not add what is 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.280
 This remote control is called bike 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.200
 pot and good we give you right click with 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 this control and it opens us the same menu 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.530
 but when what you have is control 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.240
 remote is that we will turn it on 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.009
 from far for example and this until here 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.030
 and he wants to turn it on and ready and good 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.289
 because everything he does is have the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.690
 it's true that it makes your own blowout 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.880
 we write are pretty pretty father 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.710
 so I recommend it and well 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.840
 we come to the characters in this way 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.950
 well and for character what is the hype 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.360
 that we do what is wood and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 quite iron we are also what 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.960
 there are two kraft blocks of the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.200
 next way we put some reaction 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.360
 and a half and the rest goes wood and this 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.590
 what is good then now that 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.299
 we can create what is the box 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.269
 arrangement that we are what is wood and 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:25.440
 iron for what we will do in this way and 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.050
 will give us what the cge hype is 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.060
 here is the iron back in and ready this 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.710
 will give us what is the hype c's and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.690
 here what the speakers are is the 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.070
 same crack but only that instead of him 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.990
 you do not block we need what is the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.150
 spoiler and it goes to the middle so we can 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.580
 celeron in the corners and the wood of 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.500
 this way and it will give us what it is that 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 are the speakers and here what is 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.180
 this this remote control we need 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.550
 glass one of the rest of the others by the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.380
 iron and good post will give us what is 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.570
 the remote control and good because this 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.760
 how to create what the hype with his 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.110
 remote control and everything so well more 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.490
 before the video, whether I 'm leaving what 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.620
 is the installation if you want to install 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.360
 this gorgeous mod more so right now 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.950
 we look good because we continue with the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.840
 installation of the motherboard box for 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.580
 Minecraft version no point 3.2 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.590
 but before that they should be downloaded 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.300
 these files that is the module ader and 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.220
 the bom box mode and well, you know 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.050

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.610
 description to download it goes 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.830
 and good and after having completed 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.090
 downloading those files we open a 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.520
 Minecraft 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.010
 see you here now as always 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.140
 we give ourselves options and activate the forced 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.730
 law and well this does that makes 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.650
 our minecraft eliminate all 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.240
 modes that are installed on it since 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.530
 if we install a mode that is not 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.700
 compatible with the modes that has been 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.590
 installed is added to us from kraft is going to 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.670
 grow up and good to avoid this active 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.740
 did not endeavor law to make a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.180
 clean installation in this way here not 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.410
 we wait for them to fear of charging that already 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.960
 that goes in the middle 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.290
 70 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.879

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.479
 Well, if we want to put music to 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.159
 our direction we need to go to the 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.530
 folder of our minecraft again 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.490
 so let's go open our portfolio of 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.650
 our minecraft that is about 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.389
 minecraft we open it and here we can 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.520
 folder that is called the resort that is 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.849
 this opens it open is in the folder 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.919

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.150
 the bom box folder and well then here 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.860
 we can put all the music that 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.129
 we want nothing for example here is my 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:18.900
 music I put it in, but be careful we're only 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:21.300
 him files that kind w and oh hehe so 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.219
 it's not going to read music to you in mp3 so 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.590
 Be careful with that if you follow music 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.940
 on p3 and what he is going to convert 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.920
 download this program that is called 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.930
 form the factor and well then it opens 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.940
 and well here nothing else chooses in the 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.160
 file for example they go here they are in 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.040
 video are going to audio and here they just choose 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.730
 the file for example here comes out or hehe 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.010
 and ekiza the w w I will choose the w 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.370
 here we insert the file we are going 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.260
 desk here is my music and good 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.050
 well, we give nothing here to configure 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.670
 destination high quality ok and we give to 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.000
 accept and to whom later we give 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:02.030
 start so that the file becomes 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.310
 awy good since we have the file 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.950
 we close the program we go to our 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.660
 folder and we put our music and ready 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.250
 and well then in this way you put 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.000
 music to your bombo c's and remember that 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.660

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.340

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.440
 so you know now if I 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.460
 dismissal as they say for my people there not 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.460
