00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 my family is the most recent book of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.200
 called his Nazarian and is a return to the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.960
 adult universe after having 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:19.830
 experienced juveniles with the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:21.539
 Damn boy 2012's release on 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.090
 Ear of the book is saying that this 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.830
 what a thriller or a suspense 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.869
 but it was not what I found in here 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 not really I did not find any 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.800
 possibility to fit this here 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.960
 within a genre because it has no 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.329
 a very well defined plot you have 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 situation that triggers a series of 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.280
 of events that the death of a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.379
 women and the consequences that this brings 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 in the life of her son in the active 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.190
 book reminds many mutarelli books 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.860
 who even participated in the training game 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 It's wonderful that book that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.420
 character begins in a tone of 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.969
 normality that will understand the madness 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.210
 as the difference unfolds here 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.329
 is on the pretext that it is the absence of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.400
 authority in the prologue there already has the key 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.520
 to unveil entire native 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.010
 mother represented peace and order in the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.159
 the lack of it will slip into Andrew 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.350
 the wildest state or is bad in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.570
 At first you can understand that this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.240
 book will be an allusion to the theory 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.490
 thomas hobbes politics who philosopher 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.270
 English saying that every man was 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.720
 cruel and brutal by nature and would 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 of an authority which provides 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 order to contain itself 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.180
 André certainly needs to be contained right? 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.549
 When their mother decides to leave the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.979
 living on the site he already 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.040
 to decay that he was almost a rock star 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.310
 and became just a junkie jim that the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.920
 air in a dirty and lonely apartment like 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.060
 dead there is possibility that was going 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640
 although not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.890
 of course I expected to be surprised 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.509
 for this book but the family is 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.460
 very predictable 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.110
 This does not mean that it is 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.180
 a complete waste of time 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.799
 Nazarian style is the high point of the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.360
 book and is what will keep the reader 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.330
 interested and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.250
 however central the character is 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080
 detestable and however much the narrative 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.390
 can not surprise 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.400
 just to give an example of the conflict of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.100
 the way the author uses 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.240
 here is very creative had never seen 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.340
 something like that 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.140
 I'm not going to give you an example, you're right. 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.530
 I can not find any now 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.360
 to talk to you is more is enough 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.459
 cool you find it for yourself 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.320
 It is also distressing to 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.260
 andré pinto's daydreams but be a 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.680
 third person can feel the skin 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.380
 revolt to have when you get to the top 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.150
 fame money women and suddenly have 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.920
 all this taken away 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.110
 along with the dignity that came along 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.420
 with them the electronics that were in 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.050
 house or are taken away by the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.959
 dell then simply does not work that 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.700
 emphasizes the return to the wild and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.130
 the people who visit only serve to 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.010
 increase the humiliation of the 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.330
 increase their anguish that makes them lose 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.160
 peace of mind 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.560
 at the end of the reading you will find the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.019
 epilogue now, even if there existed 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.820
 There were a lot of people complaining about 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.269
 a lot of people who have read the book 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.610
 complaining about the supposedly open end 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.519
 and it is important that you know the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.110
 difference between history and native 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.080
 Okay, let's take the example that everything 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.540
 world knows harry potter if the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.000
 author was to put the whole story of 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.950
 harry potter in that series until you find 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.870
 for example how he was born 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.700
 how did he learn to crawl like 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.100
 he learned to speak how it is 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.350
 to normal school before he was 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.959
 called for hogwarts and everything else 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.670
 there is not only he has not understood the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.799
 narrative tells only what is 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.049
 necessary for you to understand the 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.820
 harry potter fight with voldemort and 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.670
 also how harry potter got 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.670
 to overcome the parents' death 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.310
 only this and here the narrative representation 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.310
 the trajectory of the andré as to the state 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.799
 wild is madness and everything else in the end 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.470
 of the book was missing another 20 pages with 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.549
 our line almost screams subtly that 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.110
 ended 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.690
 You want to know what happens after then 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.820
 If you want then you can invent the 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.709
 your own end takes the tracks with the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.410
 author was left 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.330
 the book and try to guess what 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.030
 It happens later, I do not know where I am 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.940
 satisfied with the end presented and 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.410
 so bi bi is going to take four 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.680
 lamps are just now 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.449
 lamps that give the note here in the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.220
 literary hair was so hope 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.139
 did you like it for more content? 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.220

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.500
 in work hair 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.690
 Hi, I'm from literary hairlines . 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.630
 They are reminded that for news about 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.270
 which had sent it had canceled production 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.840
 from the American series based on 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.400
 Gay river book much as it is now 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.590
 tormented media announced that it will 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.590
 literally take the book from the pope
