come on here's a tutorial on using
switches<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:45.180> bring<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.360> key<00:01:46.570> toward<00:01:46.990> so

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
switches to bring the key toward so

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.950 
switches to bring the key toward so
where<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.860> need<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.340> be<00:01:49.560> real<00:01:50.560> simple<00:01:51.960> well

where you need it to be real simple well

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.540 
where you need it to be real simple well
by<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.200> way<00:01:53.320> about<00:01:53.619> that<00:01:53.770> transition<00:01:54.010> right

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
by the way about that transition right

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.570 
by the way about that transition right
there<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:55.240> because<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:56.380> forgot<00:01:56.979> how<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.250> do

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
there it's because I forgot how to do

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.660 
there it's because I forgot how to do
this<00:01:57.729> level<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.259> I<00:01:59.290> play<00:01:59.770> through<00:02:00.040> it<00:02:00.130> once<00:02:00.369> and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
this level so I play through it once and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.240 
this level so I play through it once and
it<00:02:00.790> was<00:02:00.820> kind<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.930> slow<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.410> boring<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:02.979> i<00:02:03.009> just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
it was kind of slow and boring so i just

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.270 
it was kind of slow and boring so i just
edited<00:02:03.400> out<00:02:03.910> so<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:05.470> part<00:02:05.710> would<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:05.979> be<00:02:06.070> as

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
edited out so this part would it be as

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.570

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
some transitions like that I'll just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.700 
some transitions like that I'll just
call<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:13.410> transitioning<00:02:14.410> out<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
call it is transitioning out the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.760 
call it is transitioning out the
boringness<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:16.870> right<00:02:17.050> let's<00:02:17.290> move<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.710> to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770

the<00:02:17.980> next<00:02:18.010> area<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.620> think<00:02:20.860> here<00:02:21.100> we're

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
the next area and I think here we're

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.940 
the next area and I think here we're
introduced<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:22.060> new<00:02:22.300> enemy<00:02:22.480> type<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.440> I'm

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
introduced a new enemy type I think I'm

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
think it makes some of some more of that

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.839 
think it makes some of some more of that
type<00:03:40.989> go<00:03:41.170> away<00:03:41.790> or<00:03:42.790> cut<00:03:43.329> back<00:03:44.310> go<00:03:45.310> away<00:03:45.430> come

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
type go away or cut back go away come

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.869 
type go away or cut back go away come
back<00:03:45.909> pedal<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:47.709> gives<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.159> more<00:03:48.370> time<00:03:48.400> that's

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
back pedal it gives you more time that's

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.410 
back pedal it gives you more time that's
work<00:03:49.239> anyways<00:03:50.129> you<00:03:51.129> have<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.489> run<00:03:51.819> it<00:03:51.849> jump

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
work anyways you have to run it jump

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.869 
work anyways you have to run it jump
over<00:03:52.720> those<00:03:52.870> blue<00:03:53.109> blocks<00:03:53.440> otherwise<00:03:54.430> you'll

now<00:04:37.630> this<00:04:38.050> part<00:04:38.740> would<00:04:39.070> have<00:04:39.190> been<00:04:39.340> find<00:04:40.350> it

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
now this part would have been find it

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.390 
now this part would have been find it
not<00:04:41.590> for<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:41.980> foolishness

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.129 

and<00:04:45.990> here's<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.320> good<00:04:47.830> run<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.400> think

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
and here's the good run that I think

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.749 
and here's the good run that I think
yeah<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.259> probably<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.620> if<00:04:50.889> I<00:04:50.979> transition<00:04:51.610> to

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
yeah it probably is if I transition to

00:04:51.759 --> 00:05:01.170 
yeah it probably is if I transition to
it<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:56.460> all<00:04:57.460> right<00:04:57.729> here<00:04:58.360> we<00:04:58.419> go<00:05:00.180> come

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
it that it is all right here we go come

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.510 
it that it is all right here we go come
on<00:05:01.389> just<00:05:01.870> backflip<00:05:02.320> onto<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.800> key<00:05:03.009> don't<00:05:03.340> hit

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
on just backflip onto the key don't hit

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.340
