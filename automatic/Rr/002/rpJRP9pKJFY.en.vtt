 hello everyone knows night and we get 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.120
 found for a new pvp video 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.430
 it was a moment that it is through 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.759
 this video is finally not really 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.990
 jean just the pvp it does not hurt to 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.590
 time so I thought why not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.230
 to make one 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.850
 so if not for the red theme the direct 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.670
 it's in the description of a video of 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.480
 all like that no one here is everything is 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.559
 said it swam to the one who made me see 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.570
 like every time you ask so 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 we're in a big con pistachio captain 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.110
 super renault who charged at 184 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.079
 a priori I think he is in view of his 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.829
 headdress and we'll see how we go 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.000
 defend against this little xelor so and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.070
 fishing I place the bombs a little bit 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.430
 really no matter how, but we 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.590

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.440
 see in the 70's of withdrawal a priori 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.430

 as much as I do that in time 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.649
 yeah that's math size but no 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.080

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.300
 flat I move anyway just eh 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.670
 for fun and in my place I was 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.680
 rewind I imagine a guy with a 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.680
 needle here that starts to turn into 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.680

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.710
 heart what 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.030
 let's see what I could 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:10.530
 do well in this case or so 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.020
 I can redo the release what is it 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.610

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.910
 like that it's like that yes I can do it again 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.600
 to do better but here I see there I do 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.580
 as if I could have tried to play 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.290
 open air but hey it me not too tempted 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.209
 to take a spell the moment 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.660
 currently because now it's 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.430
 the moment 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.010
 finally for me but for you it's not 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.440
 like we imagine we're in a 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.550
 parallel world where now this is the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.470
 future where we are 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.150
 where you are going back you are back 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.320
 in the past to see my video me 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.540
 I was going in the future for you his 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.190
 road in time for my short video so 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.989
 pistachio capital what would I do 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.450

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.650
 it home visits and here and I 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.900
 push back one since you do not fight 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.050
 Assumes the Habran France in this joc 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.310
 chao maybe had to fart but good 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.340
 if I had not done I did a try 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.660
 critical i do not remember wait way 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.670
 magnetization so I could have done a 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.050
 other and then do all summer at the I 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.290
 you say I say the lift good 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.320

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.990
 we love the wish of fears but good 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.040
 it's a bit late for them to 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.220
 new resolutions 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.780
 because your maximum resolution 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:55.760
 it's the 720p to see the good video 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:59.030

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.830
 plus he a payment - and the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.380
 resistances well it's not be useful I 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.790
 picked up I think that even take a sheet 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.270
 goudreau would have been better to remove 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:25.250
 smes good taste swept me this is 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.550
 good bye I am Russian 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:34.280
 what does a yellow tag mean? 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:38.600
 day I'll know where else yeah I'll 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.900
 put a bomb here and I'm going to 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.120
 block like this 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.500
 and yeah yeah I'll put no ah 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.220
 yeah I say again approaching the bomb 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.150
 overload 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.730
 we will play overloaded 7 well ben that and 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.140
 I put myself in I thought 'I 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.090
 maybe should have approached me because 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.530
 I risked nothing in melee ah yes 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.060
 so this bomb is called oxen 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.370
 oxen of a tower or a furniture 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.900
 turn it might be enough 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.160
 we will see in taboo this human theme 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.550
 but good but they will explode all 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.590
 only 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.820
 no I'm laughing it does not work this thing 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.810
 mastery of the bow 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.380
 sir is preparing for war at the 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.190
 war like in war 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.190
 so I class this bomb 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:30.910
 what could I do 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.910
 if I come here I do like that 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.780

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:47.470
 clown on our you know what I believe that 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:48.370
 I found what I'm coming here and 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.850
 I pushed the bomb 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.680
 that's it and that at least it depends on how much 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.860
 at roxy and then I'll see what I 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.860

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.900
 howell west and me you hurt me and you 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.120
 risking ad has fallen people 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.440

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.139
 at the same time I will be able oxen a ride 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.510

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.940
 where there are 107 points of life it's going 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.180

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.560
