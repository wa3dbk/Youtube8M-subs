waterproof and dustproof but that's not

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.810 
waterproof and dustproof but that's not
enough<00:00:07.560> since<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> ex<00:00:08.069> cover<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
enough since the ex cover to the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.240 
enough since the ex cover to the
predecessor<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.840> device<00:00:10.230> was<00:00:10.800> actually

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
predecessor of this device was actually

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.950 
predecessor of this device was actually
even<00:00:11.460> more<00:00:11.940> interesting<00:00:12.420> since<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.780> was

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
even more interesting since it was

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.629 
even more interesting since it was
shockproof<00:00:13.290> also<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.889> could<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.219> drop<00:00:14.429> it

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
shockproof also you could just drop it

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.120 
shockproof also you could just drop it
and<00:00:14.820> nothing<00:00:15.660> would<00:00:15.809> happen<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.500> course<00:00:16.740> you

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
and nothing would happen of course you

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.920 
and nothing would happen of course you
can't<00:00:17.340> drop<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.490> form<00:00:17.820> there<00:00:18.210> maybe<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.480> Skype

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
can't drop it form there maybe a Skype

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.210 
can't drop it form there maybe a Skype
or<00:00:19.050> something<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.039> just

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
or something like that but you can just

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.460 
or something like that but you can just
drop<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.550> or<00:00:21.000> maybe<00:00:21.480> somebody<00:00:21.750> bumps<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
drop it or maybe somebody bumps you and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.960 
drop it or maybe somebody bumps you and
you<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.769> let<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.100> fall<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> ground<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

even here and this little micro USB and
the<00:01:20.130> headphone<00:01:20.610> cover<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> top<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the headphone cover on the top so now of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.560 
the headphone cover on the top so now of
course<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> question<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.680> will<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:24.090> blend

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
course the question is will it not blend

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.800 
course the question is will it not blend
but<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.770> break<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:27.299> drop<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.570> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
but will it break if we just drop it on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
but will it break if we just drop it on
the<00:01:27.930> floor<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.380> let's<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.770> stand<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.310> here

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the floor so let's just stand up here

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760 
the floor so let's just stand up here
from<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> table<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.360> maybe<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.960> drop<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
from the table and maybe just drop it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
from the table and maybe just drop it
down<00:01:31.799> onto<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> carpet<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> course<00:01:33.060> nothing

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
down onto the carpet of course nothing

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.530 
down onto the carpet of course nothing
will<00:01:34.470> happen<00:01:35.009> except<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.299> just

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
will happen except for it really just

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.020 
will happen except for it really just
bounces<00:01:37.470> around<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.759> really

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
bounces around and then you can really

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090 
bounces around and then you can really
