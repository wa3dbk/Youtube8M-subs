almost<00:05:28.470> intercepted<00:05:28.920> man<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.430> got<00:05:29.700> away<00:05:29.940> with

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
almost intercepted man I got away with

almost intercepted man I got away with
one<00:05:30.330> there<00:05:30.570> but<00:05:30.750> it<00:05:30.870> ended<00:05:31.200> up<00:05:31.350> turning<00:05:31.620> out

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
one there but it ended up turning out

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.130 
one there but it ended up turning out
the<00:05:32.220> way<00:05:32.490> we<00:05:32.850> needed<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.270> too<00:05:33.450> is<00:05:33.600> he<00:05:33.750> makes<00:05:33.960> the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
the way we needed it too is he makes the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.590 
the way we needed it too is he makes the
catch<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.950> defender<00:05:35.430> mrs.<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.030> nobody<00:05:36.570> is

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
catch the defender mrs. and nobody is

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.840 
catch the defender mrs. and nobody is
catching<00:05:37.020> Cooper<00:05:37.320> after<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.800> one<00:05:38.100> we're

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
catching Cooper after that one we're

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.200 
catching Cooper after that one we're
going<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.060> go<00:05:39.270> up<00:05:39.420> 17<00:05:40.290> 27<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:41.910> would

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
going to go up 17 27 and that would

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.540 
going to go up 17 27 and that would
pretty<00:05:42.510> much<00:05:42.660> seal<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.590> deal<00:05:43.800> as<00:05:44.130> you<00:05:44.340> can

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
pretty much seal the deal as you can

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.190 
pretty much seal the deal as you can
imagine<00:05:44.790> we'd<00:05:45.180> eventually<00:05:45.420> get<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:45.990> ball

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
imagine we'd eventually get the ball

imagine we'd eventually get the ball
