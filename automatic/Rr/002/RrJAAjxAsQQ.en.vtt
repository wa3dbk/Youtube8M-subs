00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.179
 hi everyone zoo one we get 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.340
 find today for a new 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.220
 glitch so to fly in the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 heavens with his character so this is the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 exactly the same glitch as with the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.109
 cars except you're going to do everything 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.080
 just with a character this time 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.849
 so here you go out of the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.430
 part to 400 miles it's just at 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.719
 portal that is right so you 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.700
 go place yourself as I do 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.070
 in the video so you put it well 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 against brick and pan you're a tooth 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.430
 so you do r1 and I believe that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.469
 I can not remember the key 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.030
 xbox hangman so you go to 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.620
 covered against the wall the gate in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.960
 as long as it blocks the portal and that bug 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.059
 that the player who wants to fly 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.739
 it's going to run into the gay in the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.850
 portal 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.949
 so he'll push against either in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.289
 walking without power and normally that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.969
 will do a counter force and your father 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.390
 finally the character who run against 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.110
 the portal is going to fly in the air 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.730
 so 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670
 you can sometimes fly away super 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.640
 heroes or times you really fly away 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.530
 just a little bit stuff to shit so 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 me on the video I did not have a lot of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 luck I have them I'm not really 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.620
 flights but it can happen that you 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.700
 were leaving frankly rather not hurt 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.780
 and so here it is I wanted it for sure 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.190
 I know that a lot of people 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.210
 already knew this glitch it was 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.140
 just for the fun of you 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.150
 was proposing today 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.530
 so do not forget to subscribe 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.240
