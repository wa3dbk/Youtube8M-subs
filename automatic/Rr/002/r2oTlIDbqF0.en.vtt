I'm just going to spray this down and
then<00:01:41.310> set<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> work<00:01:41.820> wiping<00:01:45.500> ecosmart<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
then set to work wiping ecosmart is a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.069 
then set to work wiping ecosmart is a
great<00:01:47.009> alternative<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.729> using<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.299> hose<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
great alternative to using a hose and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.010 
great alternative to using a hose and
buckets<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.549> being<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.570> waterless

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
buckets because being a waterless

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.690 
buckets because being a waterless
solution<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.680> means<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.040> don't<00:01:53.280> need<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.549> have

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
solution that means I don't need to have

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
solution that means I don't need to have
access<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.329> running<00:01:54.570> water<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:56.100> need

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
access to running water and I don't need
