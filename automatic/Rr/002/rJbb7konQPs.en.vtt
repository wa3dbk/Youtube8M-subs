perspective<00:01:07.430> slightly<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> squatter<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.710> guess

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
perspective slightly a squatter I guess

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.020 
perspective slightly a squatter I guess
it<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> phone<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it because the phone is as well and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420 
it because the phone is as well and
reduce<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> package<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> evidence<00:01:13.860> 3g

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
reduce the package up in the evidence 3g

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.690 
reduce the package up in the evidence 3g
so<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> we'll<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> look<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> phone<00:01:17.460> now

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so so we'll have a look at the phone now

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
so so we'll have a look at the phone now
and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.180> we'll<00:01:18.330> get<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> 3gs<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> i'll

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and then we'll get a 3gs out and i'll

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.130 
and then we'll get a 3gs out and i'll
have<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.890> we'll<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.580> compares

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
have a look at we'll see how it compares

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.749 
have a look at we'll see how it compares
