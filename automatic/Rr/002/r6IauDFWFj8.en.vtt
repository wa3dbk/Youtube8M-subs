00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.429
 I was 15 years old we will propose to do 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.480
 good parades at the time I was not 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.300
 I had a body of a 15 year old girl 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.710
 so it went on and so is I 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.990
 started doing some small parade 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 beauty contests 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.789
 and then then I was spotted 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.039
 offered me to run campaigns 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.380
 commercials and the like and then I get 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 am directed towards the middle 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.949
 professional dance and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.380
 the artistic and they offered me the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.200
 deal I gladly accepted because 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.190
 ben sport is an area that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 interests me 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.649
 and then the month of February actually we go 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.829
 talk about love because of the 14 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.480
 February she to Valentine's Day and so 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160
 so we're going to talk about fitness for the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.329
 month of January 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.420
 so that can start from 2 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.420
 January 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.780
 yes I think it's important especially 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.690
 now because good now I 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.369
 a way of life that makes me that I 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.680
 must i have to pay attention to me my 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.630
 picture and 8 I think that's important 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.630
 already for this for his well-being to oneself 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.890
 a lot but we have good genetics 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:21.350
 also in the family my sisters are 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.720
 like me so here I redid my 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:30.229
 chest and this is the only thing that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.259
 I redid you come these islands do not know 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.450
 I like very much it is otherwise as 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.770
 other artists 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:43.369
 well it's a bit of a possibility but 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:45.560
 michael jackson it's just someone 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.119
 well here it is 24 years old and he makes 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.530
 hours like all 24 year old guys 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.840
 except that it is the cameras pointed 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.580
 on him I want him well so 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.100
 necessarily me I'm not I 'm not in 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.289
 war with him 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.939
 inevitably it does not make me I'm a little 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.409
 sad for him because it's for me 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.030
 he's a great athlete I always have 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.570
 said i saw him i saw him i always 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.670
 said by the way but now it takes 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.280
 that he's pulling himself together because because 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.730
 here I think all fans 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:23.590
 wait for him what they react to 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.590
 at home I left them to him 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.440
 then it is difficult because we 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.079
 that as soon as I speak 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.980
 after that fuse the men I like 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.160
 good thiago silva 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.290
 I find cute and then here is a 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.700
 athlete 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.359
 otherwise I do not know me rafael nadal there 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.359
 like that it heats 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.440
 I'm more in the talk 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.950
 show to his aisles not enough scripted 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.620
 would put in the American way where we receive 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.440
 people and push to cool we do some 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.650
 skits staged if I was 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.530
 in touch with the production but but 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.049
 I was not I did not I was not 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.629
 further than that I simply refused 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:26.879
 participation there is music the 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.040
 cinema always dance 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.099
 so I'm open a bit to everything because 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.829
 that I am I am in the artistic 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.530
 so I try to be versatile enough 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.980
 as I come it's like like 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.379
 as an example and as an idol so so 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.379
 I try a little to be trimmed I'm singing 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.409
 no I would not have gone through there I am 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.409
 too shy 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.030
 yes but for the moment I'm devoting myself 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.030
 on macharia 3 2
