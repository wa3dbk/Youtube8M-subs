break down this plate just because about

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.610 
break down this plate just because about
that<00:00:44.600> but<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:45.780> why<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> had<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> break<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that but that's why I had to break it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930 
that but that's why I had to break it
down<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.219> place<00:00:47.399> let's<00:00:47.730> take<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
down in the first place let's take a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
down in the first place let's take a
look<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.210> its<00:00:48.420> speed<00:00:48.860> then<00:00:49.860> we're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> go

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
look at its speed then we're going to go

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000 
look at its speed then we're going to go
back<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> go<00:00:50.879> over<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> real<00:00:52.199> special

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
