00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.290

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.119

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.820
 jailbroken precisely it's the same 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.929
 developers who created the application 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.699
 basically the most feature 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.949
 interesting is the possibility of 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.630
 in the application messages 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.030

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.520
 the designer did not receive anything but it's 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.399

 now focus on the parameters of 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.770
 the application firstly if you 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.740
 want to activate the acknowledgment 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.740
 it happens in sms and mms network 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.110
 settings 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.530
 fold up pop up 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.730
 that's basically when you receive a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.800
 clear message to the people that appears 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.620
 you will be able to say where you 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.940
 want to have this pop-up in the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.910
 lockscreen springboard or in 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.800
 the applications then we have the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.840
 possibility of choosing the type of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.290
 light when you receive a message 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.610

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.250
 of colors you choose the color 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 you want to go down 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.590
 slightly and we will be able to modify the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.310
 notification icons finally rather the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.130
 color you have black of the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.170
 red of the green of the blue of the violet gray 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.330

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.760
 you choose the one that suits you 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
 after in private life it's great 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.280
 interesting 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.299
 you can hide at the level of the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.130
 notification the name of the person who 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.750
 sends you an SMS and the text 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.400
 so it's up to you again 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.890
 once after you can change everything 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.150
 what is his as well as the vibration 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.120
 are you going to receive a 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.709
 message is you managing that when 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 you will go into customization 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.640
 you will be able to change the theme of 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.680
 the application but most are not 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.510
 not special I think you're going to be 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.040
 agree with me but precisely the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.739
 developers wanted to give you the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.989
 freedom since you can change to 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.239
 both the presentation of the list of 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.519
 conversations and also the part 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.140
 discussions and that as you the 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.060
 wish you can change the color 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.700
 in the background we can even add 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.160
 an image we can change the color of 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.470
 text messages and even change the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.880
 presentation of the bubbles finally brief you 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.030
 can customize this app 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.799
 from A to Z 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.299
 after we have photos of the wholesale contacts 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.650
 we can show you the pictures of your 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.019
 contacts both in the app 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.540
 but also in pop up and she will you 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.340
 even proposes to harvest a maximum of 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.440
 photos by logging into your 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.120
 Facebook account 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.410
 then we have quick compost shortcut where 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.230
 you will choose how you go 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.489
 quickly compose your message either 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.829
 by long pressing the button 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.060
 search or photos or by going 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.280
 in the party a notification 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.299
 that's exactly what I did 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.430
 find it more convenient 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.979
 I support and I can write 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.419
 sms checking ticking menu of the senses 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.470
 you will be able to display the old ones 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.169
 sent messages when you go 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.060
 receive a pop up and finally in 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.340
 shortcut recipient you go 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.680
 choose if you want to have a contact 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.820
 which will be displayed by default when you 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.100
 want to write an SMS 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.870
 finally to finish we can configure the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.210
 buttons can choose positioning 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.120
 of each of them for example I 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.680
 want to put the call button in front 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.729
 I'm showing hop hop hop and play button 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.650
 is the first of a model you can 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.419
 create your own sms patterns if 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.360
 you usually write a message 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.370
 type these practices whose ages 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.780
 planned we will show you the messages 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.520
 that you intend to send I 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.289
 have not so it will not happen on track 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.680
 deferred there you have the opportunity to 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:11.070
 put a self-timer between 1 and 3 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.240
 seconds of sending bulk sms I 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.669
 want to send sms 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.210
 I have three seconds there to be able to 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.430
 stop sending one can also 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.009
 secure the application by creating a 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.169
 pattern it's kind of code and we're going 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.570
 have to have this motive there every time 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.940
 we open the shop sms application for 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.690
 to be able to secure your messages which 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.729
 is rather practical 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.949
 we can also black listed 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.810
 contacts is left pressed on a contact 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.430
 and a window will show where you 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.949
 go press put on the list 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.500
 black and therefore you will receive more 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.900
 messages from the latter we can 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.389
 also save messages from 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.240
 the application that will allow you by the 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.810
 then restore them if you 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.430
 finally want to finish in another 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.770
 option we can add a signature to 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.659
 level of messages choose style 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.789
 emoticons sound iphone be android 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:05.039
 add a top while sending 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.229
 put a meter from the mobile operator 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.880
 et cetera et cetera I will leave you 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.560
 look for yourself 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.360
 so what do you think of this 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.340
