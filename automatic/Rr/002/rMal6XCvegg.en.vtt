taking of deer if anything it just

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.950 
taking of deer if anything it just

decreases the time spent in doing so

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.020

what<00:06:40.650> it<00:06:40.770> does<00:06:40.979> though<00:06:41.280> is<00:06:41.520> increase<00:06:42.000> the

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
what it does though is increase the

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.159 
what it does though is increase the
