00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
cyclical thing so they sell the cotton

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.620 
cyclical thing so they sell the cotton
in<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.640> next<00:01:55.910> season<00:01:56.030> they<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.480> keep

all over India yeah and we found this
out<00:02:03.260> we<00:02:03.440> wanted<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.770> go<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.280> work<00:02:04.520> not<00:02:05.420> at<00:02:05.630> all

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
out we wanted to go and work not at all

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.510 
out we wanted to go and work not at all
within<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.290> system<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:07.010> wanted<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.370> go

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
within this system we wanted to go

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.130 
within this system we wanted to go
around<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:08.000> system<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.450> find<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.750> way<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.899> do

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
around the system and find a way to do

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.900 
around the system and find a way to do
this<00:02:09.290> much<00:02:09.500> more<00:02:09.710> sustainably<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.790> we

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
this much more sustainably so we

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.780 
this much more sustainably so we
partnered<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.600> chetna<00:02:12.140> organic

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
partnered with the chetna organic

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.340 
partnered with the chetna organic
cooperative<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:14.330> really<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> world's<00:02:15.170> most

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
cooperative it's really the world's most

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.050 
cooperative it's really the world's most
sustainable<00:02:15.770> farming<00:02:16.280> cooperative<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.000> it

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
sustainable farming cooperative and it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.580 
sustainable farming cooperative and it
comes<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.510> cotton<00:02:18.940> 15,000<00:02:19.940> small<00:02:20.180> farmers<00:02:20.630> in

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
comes to cotton 15,000 small farmers in

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.210 
comes to cotton 15,000 small farmers in
central<00:02:22.010> India<00:02:22.310> practicing<00:02:23.240> sustainable

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
central India practicing sustainable

organic agriculture on a community level
so<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.400> really<00:02:28.700> thinking<00:02:28.850> about<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.390> farm

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
so it's really thinking about the farm

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.260 
so it's really thinking about the farm
as<00:02:30.110> not<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> farmer<00:02:31.340> but<00:02:31.640> as<00:02:31.790> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
as not just the farmer but as the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
that way they're avoiding the traders

they're avoiding the exploitation that

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.220 
they're avoiding the exploitation that
happens<00:03:01.790> as<00:03:02.000> their<00:03:02.180> cotton<00:03:02.510> goes<00:03:02.690> up<00:03:02.900> through

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
happens as their cotton goes up through

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.979 
happens as their cotton goes up through
the<00:03:03.260> supply<00:03:04.070> chain<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:04.610> pay<00:03:04.970> fair<00:03:05.690> trade

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
the supply chain so we pay fair trade

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.259 
the supply chain so we pay fair trade
prices<00:03:06.290> directly<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.130> those<00:03:07.250> farmers<00:03:07.670> why<00:03:08.209> do

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
prices directly to those farmers why do

you do a fair trade fair trade as an
organization<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:11.630> really<00:03:12.230> committed<00:03:12.860> to

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
organization is really committed to

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.910 
organization is really committed to
figuring<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:14.000> out<00:03:14.209> particularly<00:03:15.200> cotton<00:03:15.650> is

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
figuring this out particularly cotton is

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.330 
figuring this out particularly cotton is
an<00:03:16.070> incredibly<00:03:16.670> complicated<00:03:17.150> commodity<00:03:18.049> and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
an incredibly complicated commodity and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.699 
an incredibly complicated commodity and
there's<00:03:19.340> been<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.580> huge<00:03:19.970> amount<00:03:20.299> of

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
there's been a huge amount of

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.080 
there's been a huge amount of
exploitation<00:03:21.709> both<00:03:22.040> both<00:03:22.489> environmentally

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
exploitation both both environmentally

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.990 
exploitation both both environmentally
and<00:03:23.480> socially<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:24.380> is<00:03:24.500> compounded<00:03:25.160> as

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and socially that is compounded as

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.360 
and socially that is compounded as
business<00:03:26.540> has<00:03:26.720> got<00:03:26.930> their<00:03:27.140> hands<00:03:27.320> into<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.830> so

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
business has got their hands into it so

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.520 
business has got their hands into it so
when<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.640> comes<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.600> commodity<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.260> cotton

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
when it comes to the commodity of cotton

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.590 
when it comes to the commodity of cotton
itself<00:03:30.890> we're<00:03:31.670> able<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.030> work<00:03:32.180> with<00:03:32.299> them<00:03:32.450> to

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
itself we're able to work with them to

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.120 
itself we're able to work with them to
identify<00:03:32.660> what<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.560> right<00:03:33.709> price<00:03:33.739> that

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
identify what is the right price that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.890 
identify what is the right price that
these<00:03:34.250> farmers

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
these farmers

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.809
