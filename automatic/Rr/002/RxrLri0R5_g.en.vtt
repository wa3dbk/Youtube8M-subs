on<00:03:52.790> I've<00:03:53.790> got<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.390> here<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:56.100> will

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
on I've got this one here and this will

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.390 
on I've got this one here and this will
make<00:03:56.490> nine<00:03:57.170> how<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.230> use<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:59.010> one<00:03:59.160> there

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
make nine how you use this one there

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.050 
make nine how you use this one there
I'll<00:04:00.000> just<00:04:00.180> use<00:04:00.330> water<00:04:00.510> through<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> whole
