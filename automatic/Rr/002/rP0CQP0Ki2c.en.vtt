00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 harvest salad early in the spring 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.379
 then you can do that very well with 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.590
 salad and schnitzler do as well 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.980
 lettuce varieties are for early cultivation 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.560
 suitable are the salad plants 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.920
 cold germ the lies is even when in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.510
 the first days cold and cold 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.789
 temperatures prevail 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.490
 it should be around 7 degrees 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.309
 a bit warmer and the risk 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:40.559
 I'll just go in and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:45.050
 Try it on lettuce 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.850
 seeded here only as a young plant and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 after 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 Isolated lettuce should have one 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.449
 Plant distance of 20 centimeters 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.640
 iceberg lettuce even 30 cm apart 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:04.530
 but here at the young plants grown 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.720
 reaches a row distance of ten 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.930
 centimeters to other cultures like 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:18.330
 kohlrabi and plant here too only 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.790
 superficially maybe a half 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:27.360
 centimeters deep look easy 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:29.640
 press and good left although it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.799
 again and again NachtfrÃ¶ste even developed 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.799
 Lettuce in a greenhouse is great 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.860
 This type of young plants are in few 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.390
 weeks become strong and strong 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.430
 I hardened the salad plants 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.040
 by first closing the door during the day 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.380
 left open and then now too 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.509
 the last two nights the greenhouse 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.840
 left open so that ever 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:01.130
 that is the top plants now 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:10.100
 Carefully with a plant shovel 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:16.360
 get rid of this root ball easily 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:23.000
 on without damaging much roots 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.569
 then plant the individual vigorous ones 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.569
 to arrive 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:42.080
 The plants are now getting together 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:45.020
 with a salad and salad 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.700
 kohlrabi in exchange with neighbors 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.700
 the onions and the morning
