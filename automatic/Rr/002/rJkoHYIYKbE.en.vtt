00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
looking at new weapons that are in the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.050 
looking at new weapons that are in the
workshop<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.160> think<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> worthy<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.910> being

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
workshop that I think of worthy of being

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.880 
workshop that I think of worthy of being
placed<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> game<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.320> hopefully<00:00:22.800> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
placed in the game and hopefully you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.070 
placed in the game and hopefully you
think<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> same<00:00:23.490> thing<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.930> going

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
think the same thing how this is going

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.120 
think the same thing how this is going
to<00:00:25.170> work<00:00:25.199> as<00:00:25.500> we're<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:25.920> through

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
to work as we're going to go through

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.290 
to work as we're going to go through
each<00:00:26.160> class<00:00:26.580> throughout<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> week<00:00:27.269> so

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
each class throughout the week so

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.439 
each class throughout the week so
soldier<00:00:27.960> demo<00:00:28.230> spy<00:00:28.730> etc<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
soldier demo spy etc and we're going to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
soldier demo spy etc and we're going to
go<00:00:30.570> through<00:00:30.779> each<00:00:30.929> weapon<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.619> each<00:00:31.710> class<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
go through each weapon for each class so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280 
go through each weapon for each class so
primary<00:00:32.910> secondary<00:00:33.180> melee

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
primary secondary melee

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.840 
primary secondary melee
so<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.100> weapon<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:35.579> gonna<00:00:35.700> be

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so the first weapon we're gonna be

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.520 
so the first weapon we're gonna be
looking<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> main<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.989> demo<00:00:37.230> one

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
looking at is a main for the demo one

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680 
looking at is a main for the demo one
and<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> main<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.820> named<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> Musketeers

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and this main is named the Musketeers

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720 
and this main is named the Musketeers
musket<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.800> reason<00:00:41.100> why<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> chose<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
musket the reason why I chose this

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.910 
musket the reason why I chose this
weapon<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> very<00:00:43.500> simple

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
weapon really is that as a very simple

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
weapon really is that as a very simple
design<00:00:44.219> along<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.120> some<00:00:45.270> great<00:00:45.420> modelled

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
design along with some great modelled

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
design along with some great modelled
textures<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.890> complements<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
textures which really complements the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
textures which really complements the
games<00:00:47.760> cartoon<00:00:48.210> lifestyle<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> thought

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
games cartoon lifestyle so I thought

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.020 
games cartoon lifestyle so I thought
that<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.410> really<00:00:49.559> awesome<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.760> like

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that was really awesome I like I like

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.430 
that was really awesome I like I like
weapons<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:51.690> along<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> style<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
weapons that go along with the style of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.619 
weapons that go along with the style of
the<00:00:52.590> game<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.699> thing<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> add<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> also

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the game and one thing to add is I also

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
the game and one thing to add is I also
like<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> create<00:00:55.590> tried<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> bounce

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
like the way the create tried to bounce

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
like the way the create tried to bounce
this<00:00:56.370> weapon<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.210> where<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:57.840> this

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
this weapon is where to go about this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
this weapon is where to go about this
was<00:00:58.230> basically<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.859> bump<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> range

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
was basically to bump up the range

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270 
was basically to bump up the range
projectile<00:01:00.359> speed<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> damage<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.890> only

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
projectile speed and the damage but only

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640 
projectile speed and the damage but only
give<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> user<00:01:02.789> sort<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:04.170> shot<00:01:04.470> with

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
give the user sort of a one shot with

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770 
give the user sort of a one shot with
the<00:01:04.769> weapon<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.640> there's<00:01:05.850> no<00:01:05.970> second<00:01:06.390> chances

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the weapon so there's no second chances

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.179 
the weapon so there's no second chances
if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.200> hit<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.470> first<00:01:07.650> shot<00:01:08.040> then

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
if you don't hit that first shot then

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
if you don't hit that first shot then
you're<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.210> killed

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you're probably going to be killed

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.719 
you're probably going to be killed
straight<00:01:10.530> away<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.979> quite<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> game

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
straight away so I quite like that game

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.250 
straight away so I quite like that game
mechanic<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.390> that'd<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.540> an<00:01:12.930> awesome

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
mechanic I think that'd be an awesome

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.800 
mechanic I think that'd be an awesome
weapon<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.680> add<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> game<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.390> second

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
weapon to add to the game the second

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.859 
weapon to add to the game the second

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
ironically is going to be a secondary

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
ironically is going to be a secondary
