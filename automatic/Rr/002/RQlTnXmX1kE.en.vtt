druid<00:05:53.110> I<00:05:53.230> will<00:05:53.800> soon<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.930> think<00:05:55.930> resto<00:05:56.920> is<00:05:57.100> a<00:05:57.310> lot

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
druid I will soon I think resto is a lot

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.760 
druid I will soon I think resto is a lot
easier<00:05:57.610> in<00:05:58.330> pretty<00:05:58.690> much<00:05:58.750> face<00:05:59.170> role<00:05:59.470> to<00:05:59.620> play

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
easier in pretty much face role to play

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.770 
easier in pretty much face role to play
so<00:05:59.890> I<00:06:00.100> probably<00:06:00.340> do<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.640> video<00:06:00.940> for<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.630> I

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
so I probably do a video for that and I

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.810 
so I probably do a video for that and I
might<00:06:02.050> do<00:06:02.230> one<00:06:02.380> for<00:06:02.590> taking<00:06:03.040> eventually<00:06:03.670> and

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
might do one for taking eventually and

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.630 
might do one for taking eventually and
