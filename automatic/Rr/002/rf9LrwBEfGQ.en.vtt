then<00:00:05.730> when<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.000> take<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.689> get<00:00:07.109> into<00:00:07.319> the

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439 
then when you take this and get into the

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.379 
then when you take this and get into the
rhythms<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.800> the<00:00:07.890> head<00:00:08.069> start<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.210> ones

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
rhythms of the head start with the ones

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.090 
rhythms of the head start with the ones
that<00:00:09.540> are<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.020> same<00:00:10.200> as<00:00:10.379> that<00:00:10.410> as<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> plane

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
that are the same as that as the plane

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.859 
that are the same as that as the plane
to<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> head<00:00:11.809> this<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.170> shape<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:14.629> that<00:00:15.629> is

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
to the head this this shape here that is

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.510 
to the head this this shape here that is
the<00:00:16.020> same<00:00:16.199> as<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.130> same<00:00:17.279> shape

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the same as this it's the same shape

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.010 
the same as this it's the same shape
it's<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> angular

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
it's just that this is the angular

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.689 
it's just that this is the angular
version<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.340> rhythmical

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
version and this is the rhythmical

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.419 
version and this is the rhythmical
version<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.740> we're<00:00:23.009> looking<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.339> see<00:00:23.550> where

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
version so if we're looking to see where

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
version so if we're looking to see where
where<00:00:26.429> does<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.669> front<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> face<00:00:27.150> stop

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
where does the front of the face stop

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.659 
where does the front of the face stop
and<00:00:27.689> become<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.050> side<00:00:30.949> we'd<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.070> looking<00:00:32.189> for

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and become the side we'd be looking for

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.130 
and become the side we'd be looking for
a<00:00:32.940> way<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> make<00:00:33.720> this<00:00:33.900> flow<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:36.050> where<00:00:37.050> does

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
a way to make this flow and where does

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.800 
a way to make this flow and where does
the<00:00:37.290> front<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> face<00:00:37.770> end<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.430> side

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
the front of the face end on this side

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.920 
the front of the face end on this side
about<00:00:39.810> here<00:00:40.020> where<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.200> shine<00:00:40.560> is<00:00:41.840> if<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
about here where that shine is if you

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.290 
about here where that shine is if you
look<00:00:43.080> at<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.890> every<00:00:44.160> blood<00:00:44.430> photo<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.850> great

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
look at not every blood photo is great

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
look at not every blood photo is great
not<00:00:45.690> every<00:00:45.870> lighting<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.260> great<00:00:46.470> not<00:00:46.680> every

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
not every lighting is great not every

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.610 
not every lighting is great not every
face<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.280> descriptive<00:00:48.260> that's<00:00:49.260> why<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.470> got

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
face is descriptive that's why you got

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
face is descriptive that's why you got
to<00:00:49.650> do<00:00:49.740> a<00:00:49.770> bunch<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.490> right<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.240> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to do a bunch but right about here that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 
to do a bunch but right about here that
that<00:00:51.600> shine<00:00:51.900> right<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> where<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that shine right there is where the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.110 
that shine right there is where the
corner<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> face<00:00:53.310> is<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:53.850> where<00:00:54.030> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
corner of the face is that's where this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.050 
corner of the face is that's where this
changes<00:00:54.540> to<00:00:54.660> side<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:56.040> shine<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.310> here<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
changes to side the shine right here is

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.760 
changes to side the shine right here is
where<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> changes<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.260> look<00:00:58.620> for

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
where it changes and then you look for

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.230 
where it changes and then you look for
the<00:00:58.830> peak<00:00:59.040> on<00:00:59.220> that<00:00:59.400> I<00:00:59.580> mean<00:00:59.880> where<00:01:00.060> does<00:01:00.150> the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
the peak on that I mean where does the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.180 
the peak on that I mean where does the
bone<00:01:00.390> stop<00:01:00.750> being<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.080> top<00:01:01.260> start<00:01:01.980> being<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
bone stop being the top start being the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.539 
bone stop being the top start being the
side<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:03.470> lot<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.619> stuff<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.890> obvious<00:01:05.250> but

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
side a lot of this stuff is obvious but

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
side a lot of this stuff is obvious but
you're<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.630> much<00:01:07.500> more

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you're going to get much more

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.969 
you're going to get much more
information<00:01:08.189> by<00:01:08.340> finding<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.359> on<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> head

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
information by finding it on a head

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.200 
information by finding it on a head
that's<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.429> confused<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that's not to be confused with this

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.209 
that's not to be confused with this
shape<00:01:12.479> people<00:01:12.899> often<00:01:13.170> mix<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> two<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
shape people often mix the two up this

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.899 
shape people often mix the two up this
shape<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:16.159> abstract<00:01:17.159> rhythm<00:01:17.429> that<00:01:17.549> happens

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
shape is a abstract rhythm that happens

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940 
shape is a abstract rhythm that happens
with<00:01:18.600> several<00:01:18.960> different<00:01:19.079> muscles<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.799> bones

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
with several different muscles and bones

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
with several different muscles and bones
in<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.280> face<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.759> happens<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.840> happen<00:01:22.079> to<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
in the face that happens to happen to a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.529 
in the face that happens to happen to a
lot<00:01:22.289> of<00:01:22.409> people<00:01:22.649> and<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.850> partially<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
lot of people and it's partially in the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.499 
lot of people and it's partially in the
front<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> partially<00:01:25.319> on<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.469> side<00:01:26.509> it's

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
front and partially on the side it's

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.149 
front and partially on the side it's
actually<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:28.079> back<00:01:28.289> of<00:01:28.469> this<00:01:28.590> muscle<00:01:29.039> group

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
actually the back of this muscle group

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.620 
actually the back of this muscle group
and<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:30.499> fold<00:01:31.499> here<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> base<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> eye

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
and the fold here at the base of the eye

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.059 
and the fold here at the base of the eye
and<00:01:34.939> move<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.889> can

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
and move in there and then you can

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.899 
and move in there and then you can
connect<00:01:38.819> it<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:40.590> rings<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.859> bell

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.929 

but<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.079> those<00:01:45.770> are<00:01:45.950> two<00:01:46.130> different<00:01:46.159> shapes<00:01:46.729> so

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
but so those are two different shapes so

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.819 
but so those are two different shapes so
if<00:01:47.060> you're<00:01:47.179> looking<00:01:47.450> at<00:01:47.539> his<00:01:47.719> face<00:01:47.929> you'd<00:01:48.710> be

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
if you're looking at his face you'd be

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.340 
if you're looking at his face you'd be
looking<00:01:48.979> at<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.399> muscle<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:50.259> part<00:01:51.259> of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
looking at this muscle that that part of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.480 
looking at this muscle that that part of
its<00:01:51.469> in<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.590> front<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.890> face<00:01:52.039> part<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.399> us

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
its in the front of the face part of us

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.440 
its in the front of the face part of us
inside<00:01:52.850> its<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.659> reason<00:01:54.429> for<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.729> silhouette

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
inside its the reason for the silhouette

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.520 
inside its the reason for the silhouette
having<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.899> bulge<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:59.319> so<00:02:00.319> that<00:02:00.439> you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
having that bulge on it so that you

frontal roof it's the PC they need be

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.190 
frontal roof it's the PC they need be
see<00:02:40.819> how<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:40.970> mouth<00:02:41.150> has<00:02:41.359> a<00:02:41.390> peak<00:02:41.629> here<00:02:41.660> right

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
see how the mouth has a peak here right

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.599 
see how the mouth has a peak here right
you<00:02:42.349> know<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.530> top<00:02:42.709> here<00:02:42.920> top<00:02:43.129> here<00:02:43.310> right

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
you know the top here top here right

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.160 
you know the top here top here right
squint<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.239> lower<00:02:44.390> lip<00:02:44.629> has<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> predominant

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
squint the lower lip has a predominant

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.940 
squint the lower lip has a predominant
front<00:02:45.739> inside<00:02:46.810> okay<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.319> goes<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.650> chin

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
front inside okay and it goes the chin

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.099 
front inside okay and it goes the chin
so<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.519> would<00:02:49.670> be<00:02:49.849> this<00:02:50.209> point<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:50.989> point

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
so it would be this point to this point

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.110 
so it would be this point to this point
so<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.190> just<00:02:52.400> look<00:02:52.519> for<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.730> rhythm<00:02:53.000> of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
so if I just look for the rhythm of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.120 
so if I just look for the rhythm of
where<00:02:53.299> that<00:02:53.450> where<00:02:54.109> this<00:02:54.230> thing<00:02:54.440> got<00:02:54.560> go<00:02:54.799> thank

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
where that where this thing got go thank

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.379 
where that where this thing got go thank
you

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
you

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.099 
you
then<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.870> can<00:02:57.049> tell<00:02:57.230> what<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.530> front<00:02:58.419> and<00:02:59.419> where

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
then I can tell what the front and where

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.620 
then I can tell what the front and where
it<00:03:00.200> changes<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:00.799> step<00:03:01.099> down<00:03:01.130> then<00:03:02.090> last<00:03:02.389> you

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
it changes is a step down then last you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.240 
it changes is a step down then last you
could<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.900> look<00:03:03.079> groove<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:03.410> there<00:03:03.530> it's<00:03:04.099> just

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
could it look groove in there it's just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.470 
could it look groove in there it's just
where<00:03:04.370> people<00:03:04.400> get<00:03:04.700> lost<00:03:04.849> is<00:03:05.120> where<00:03:05.269> they<00:03:05.359> get

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
where people get lost is where they get

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.000 
where people get lost is where they get
to<00:03:05.690> curvy<00:03:06.079> with<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.290> lips<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.739> doesn't

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
to curvy with the lips and it doesn't

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.120 
to curvy with the lips and it doesn't
stick<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.549> box<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.450> confuses<00:03:09.230> things<00:03:09.260> so

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
stick to the box it confuses things so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.190 
stick to the box it confuses things so
the<00:03:10.400> lips<00:03:10.609> only<00:03:11.060> exist<00:03:11.510> as<00:03:11.720> far<00:03:11.750> as<00:03:11.989> we're

the lips only exist as far as we're

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.379 
the lips only exist as far as we're
concerned<00:03:12.230> shape<00:03:12.950> wise<00:03:13.190> because<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.269> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
some of the smaller pieces so that you

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.530 
some of the smaller pieces so that you
know<00:03:53.340> you're<00:03:53.489> breaking<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:53.819> shape<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:54.360> but

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
know you're breaking that shape but but

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
different things but you can see you can

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.659 
different things but you can see you can
see<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.530> rhythmical<00:04:21.889> connection<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.460> part

slightly different things maybe you'll

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.740 
slightly different things maybe you'll
pick<00:04:26.090> up<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.240> rhythm<00:04:26.539> from<00:04:26.660> here<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:26.990> here

muzzle<00:04:47.660> shaped<00:04:47.840> Muslim<00:04:48.289> there<00:04:48.440> we<00:04:48.500> go<00:04:49.250> but

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
muzzle shaped Muslim there we go but

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.770 
muzzle shaped Muslim there we go but
that's<00:04:49.699> what<00:04:49.850> sticking<00:04:50.120> up<00:04:50.210> is<00:04:50.360> this<00:04:50.510> rhythm

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
that's what sticking up is this rhythm

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.110 
that's what sticking up is this rhythm
in<00:04:50.870> here<00:04:51.139> versus<00:04:51.889> this<00:04:52.130> shape<00:04:52.370> here<00:04:52.729> which<00:04:52.970> is

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
in here versus this shape here which is

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.270 
in here versus this shape here which is
the<00:04:53.210> difference<00:04:53.510> between<00:04:53.600> your<00:04:54.530> front<00:04:55.070> and

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
the difference between your front and

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.779 
the difference between your front and
side<00:04:55.639> of<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:55.850> box<00:04:56.380> so<00:04:57.639> distinguishing<00:04:58.639> which

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
side of the box so distinguishing which

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.460 
side of the box so distinguishing which
of<00:04:58.940> those<00:04:59.030> you're<00:04:59.240> drawing<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.840> what's<00:05:00.289> going

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
of those you're drawing is what's going

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.500 
of those you're drawing is what's going
to<00:05:00.500> give<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:01.090> clarity<00:05:02.090> with<00:05:02.479> your<00:05:02.630> drawing

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
to give you clarity with your drawing

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
to give you clarity with your drawing
but<00:05:05.510> just<00:05:05.660> go<00:05:05.810> through<00:05:06.020> all<00:05:06.110> these<00:05:06.229> what<00:05:06.380> else

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
but just go through all these what else

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.710 
but just go through all these what else
is<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> correspond<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.520> this<00:05:07.729> this<00:05:08.210> shape<00:05:08.449> is

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
is a correspond to this this shape is

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.689 
is a correspond to this this shape is
obviously<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.620> same<00:05:09.830> as<00:05:09.979> this<00:05:10.099> shape<00:05:10.400> so

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
obviously the same as this shape so

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.760 
obviously the same as this shape so
we've<00:05:11.270> just<00:05:11.300> you're<00:05:11.990> looking<00:05:12.289> to<00:05:12.380> see<00:05:12.560> where

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
we've just you're looking to see where

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.110 
we've just you're looking to see where
there's<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:12.979> front<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.310> head<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.970> get

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
there's the front of the head you get

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.290 
there's the front of the head you get
rid<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.300> all<00:05:14.389> of<00:05:14.539> our<00:05:15.310> wonderful<00:05:16.310> diagrams<00:05:17.060> up

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
rid of all of our wonderful diagrams up

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.930 
rid of all of our wonderful diagrams up
here<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:21.260> eyebrow<00:05:21.590> basically<00:05:22.130> follows<00:05:22.550> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
here the eyebrow basically follows the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.969 
here the eyebrow basically follows the
box<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.539> know<00:05:23.660> it<00:05:23.960> starts<00:05:24.320> underneath<00:05:24.800> the

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
box you know it starts underneath the

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.909 
box you know it starts underneath the
hollow<00:05:25.190> goes<00:05:25.910> over<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.690> socket<00:05:27.229> and<00:05:27.560> then

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
hollow goes over the socket and then

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.140 
hollow goes over the socket and then
where<00:05:28.099> the<00:05:28.160> head<00:05:28.280> changes<00:05:28.580> directions<00:05:28.820> where

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
where the head changes directions where

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.360 
where the head changes directions where
the<00:05:29.210> eyebrow<00:05:29.479> change<00:05:29.750> direction<00:05:30.080> so<00:05:31.070> you<00:05:31.220> want

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
the eyebrow change direction so you want

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.279 
the eyebrow change direction so you want
to<00:05:31.430> use<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.760> eyebrow<00:05:31.910> to<00:05:32.599> describe<00:05:33.020> what<00:05:33.169> it's

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
to use the eyebrow to describe what it's

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.230 
to use the eyebrow to describe what it's
sitting<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.590> when<00:05:34.580> you're<00:05:34.789> doing<00:05:35.060> this

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
sitting on when you're doing this

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240 
sitting on when you're doing this
diagram<00:05:35.720> like<00:05:36.289> this<00:05:36.349> plane<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.860> we<00:05:36.949> look<00:05:37.070> for

diagram like this plane that we look for

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.860 
diagram like this plane that we look for
here<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:37.820> is<00:05:37.970> just<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.240> rhythmical<00:05:38.599> version

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
here this is just the rhythmical version
