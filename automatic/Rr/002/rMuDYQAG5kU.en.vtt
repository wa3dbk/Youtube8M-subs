 They have commented how good it will be 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.829
 for playstation and xbox one it's worth that 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.510
 is clear and that the first day this is 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.749
 very important the first day will have a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.299
 update that we will have to install 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:54.789
 obligatorily to fix some 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.420
 books and optimization problems in the 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.339
 console voucher is an update 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 forced so we would have to install the 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.100
 I dont know 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.320
 but for the optimization plan and such 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 it is necessary to install it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.080
 It has also been commented that the game 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.630
 will weigh around 40 40 and 45 gigas 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.630
 both in team one and in play 4 is worth 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.720
 so just download and digital then there's 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.330
 quite gigas there behind me I've already 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.340
 reserved what is reserved in game is worth 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
 a store here in Spain what we 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.229
 Spain does not know if you know her 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.149
 but well it's called game and I've 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.429
 already booked there is worth what I have booked 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.990
 It cost me three euros and when I go to 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.100
 pick it up you will have to pay the remaining 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.979
 which I think were 60 60 euros worth 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.390
 the gta 5 the truth is that it is worthy of love and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.920
 compared to digital eggs but 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.250
 Well I'm going to buy it physically because 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.800
 I want the physical game and a magic 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.170
 illusion to have the gta 5 for him and 4 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.190
 physical because that of play 3 I have it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.210
 digital but good the fact is that what 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.880
 I have already booked and subtract the news 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.039
 It tells us that if we have any 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.689
 problem of the first day that you do not hesitate in 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.670
 contact the good rastas support 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.679
 the typical things because I 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.170
 they worry about that topic has always 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.480
 been like this we already had the problem is with 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.099
 the online the first days in play 3 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.310
 so he does not want this to happen 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.849
 new so it seems good to me that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.330
 say this so well we started with 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.780
 this image that he has put is worth to me 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.410
 it seems in credits and incredible up to 30 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.850
 players in activities up to 30 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.090
 players units this image please 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.540
 when there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.209
 14 15 16 17 a lot of people with a 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.420
 bunch of people my machines up to 30 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.690
 people or so it was left 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.880
 that is, it went wrong with ten people to twelve 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.550
 people how good that the maximum is 16 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.390
 not good if I want to imagine with 30 or so 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.830
 with 30 not 25 or 24 I do not know in the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.500
 I do races so everything is good 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.620
 crazy when I do the new writes 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.450
 in gta 5 for for play 4 I will make a new 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 screen obviously because I do not think 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.450
 serve the previous one because many do not 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.890
 you would have the movie 4 but good to 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.319
 will have to create a credible new 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.269
 I will announce already on twitter by facebook and 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.450
 for some video that uploads from youtube 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.440
 for you to join and it will be crazy 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.230
 death games racing madness 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.840
 because they have also confirmed that he was going to 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.209
 have then that the activities then 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.239
 we can put more or we can put 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.890
 many more things with what it means 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.390
 that we can put a lot more ramp 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.819
 races will be cooler we can 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.540
 have super mega jumps and we already had in 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.879
 the gta 5 to play 3 over here more 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.200
 and it will be amazing because obviously the 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.519
 graphic power that has the play 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.260
 four is much greater than that of the play 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.870
 3 therefore we can put more objects 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.579
 in our activities I am not much 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.900
 to do activities because I do not know but 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.820
 there are people who do we go 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.130
 incredible I think it's a nice do so 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.080
 that I 'm very happy with it because 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.470
 we can play some racing pieces and 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.730
 everything so I 'm very happy about that 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.000
 because we are going to enjoy the game 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.350
 online above in first person that 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.230
 they have also told us that it will be 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.760
 to play or both for the mode 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.290
 campaign like for online mode it 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.880
 I doubted that it was going to be for the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.650
 Mana online mode or mode 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.110
 campaign is not going to be words all like that 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.940
 that here tells us to imagine a 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.170
 first person shooter 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.960
 activities created by yourselves 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.490
 It would be incredible, and besides, we also 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.290
 says imagine you there first 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.290
 person dodging the mills not of the 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.750
 mountains would be pretty cool 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.220
 but good on one hand and on the other 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.830
 I told you in the previous video that 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.410
 well they were going to include some police or 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.930
 something therefore is denied or at least 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.640
 moment and totally because we 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.010
 we find this image that is about 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.450
 it's not about one that has entered the 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.120
 prison but it is about our 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.980
 character is about the characters that 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.849
 we have to create because they are going to increase 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.069
 that is or are going to improve let's say 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.949
 the character editor is going to have many 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.809
 more things like it gets sex here it is 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.209
 which is an inheritance that we already have in 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:14.849
 play 3 but good youtubers that is 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:18.419
 Dress appearance traits 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:22.020
 statistics are we going to have an editor 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.699
 so I'll upload a video I'll upload 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.139
 a video creating a new character 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.999
 because as you know mine is 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.669
 delayed and you have to change it totally 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:32.219
 and I do not know I want to make a character that 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:37.069
 be mine, so we will try to create 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:39.149
 I will make a video and such and there is new 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.159
 as we see there puts the new character 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:43.229
 the saints should really police seems 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.259
 that we have come here to jail or not 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.519
 I know I do not know how this will be but it looks 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.219
 that the editor will be very cool 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:52.289
 also the face is already seen as well as 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:54.539
 different to know how they have changed him 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.129
 enough stuff so I'm glad too 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:03.500
 a lot for it and finally I wanted 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:07.490
 comment that apart from all this of the 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.139
 better so of everything that will improve the game 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.080
 a lot 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.990
 we can play in play 4 the graphics and 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.580
 I say everything for the graphics because it goes 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.680
 to be flip-flopping and let's enjoy 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.699
 very much with these graphics I think that 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.669
 it's going to be the first game we're going to 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.069
 enjoy a game well next jame 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.240
 it's worth gta 5 because play 3 was already flippant 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.340
 in play four I think it's going to be 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.039
 the first game of this generation in 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.860
 say wand go to the game so 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.590
 let's hope so and I have thought 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.930
 they also removed the ones that took me 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.029
 the strike I had but now I can 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.830
 streaming and streaming that I have 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:46.319
 thought I have thought several streaming 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.569
 from 7 to 5 for play 4 as one of them 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.639
 will be looking for new things will be a 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.229
 streaming from one hour to two is worth 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.569
 looking for new things thing that has 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.490
 added new in the campaign more than anything 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.020
 it's worth online I'll also do another 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.889
 activities with you direct with 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.930
 you or we have things thought 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.849
 because since I can do it directly and 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.289

 I will be able to make videos but with the theme of 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.990
 the university maybe not good 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.510

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.190
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.580
