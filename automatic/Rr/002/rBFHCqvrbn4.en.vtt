00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
all right so I got the TRX 125 in here

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.660 
all right so I got the TRX 125 in here
86<00:00:09.320> gonna<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.650> best<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.099> see<00:00:11.250> if<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.429> can<00:00:11.550> get

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
86 gonna do my best to see if I can get

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.910 
86 gonna do my best to see if I can get
this<00:00:11.820> engine<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:14.000> three<00:00:15.000> wheeler

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
this engine in the three wheeler

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.710 
this engine in the three wheeler
one<00:00:16.920> way<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.100> another<00:00:17.160> I'm<00:00:17.580> pretty<00:00:17.850> much<00:00:18.480> just

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
one way or another I'm pretty much just

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
one way or another I'm pretty much just
going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> make<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.080> fit<00:00:22.130> it's<00:00:23.130> got<00:00:23.310> reverse

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
going to make it fit it's got reverse

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.179 
going to make it fit it's got reverse
five<00:00:24.150> speeds

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.669 

they're<00:00:27.550> pretty<00:00:27.699> cool<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:29.019> that's<00:00:29.529> what

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
they're pretty cool that's that's what

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.079 
they're pretty cool that's that's what
I'm<00:00:29.769> doing<00:00:30.009> here<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:30.340> shouldn't<00:00:30.669> be<00:00:30.910> that<00:00:30.939> hard

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
I'm doing here it shouldn't be that hard

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.060 
I'm doing here it shouldn't be that hard
to<00:00:31.689> at<00:00:31.810> least<00:00:31.929> get<00:00:32.199> them<00:00:32.320> apart

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
to at least get them apart

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.180 
to at least get them apart
hopefully<00:00:33.879> they<00:00:34.030> go<00:00:34.120> together<00:00:34.270> pretty<00:00:34.540> easy

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
hopefully they go together pretty easy

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.259 
hopefully they go together pretty easy
well<00:00:36.190> I'm<00:00:36.250> gonna<00:00:36.370> take<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:36.730> engine<00:00:36.820> out<00:00:37.059> now<00:00:37.239> I

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
well I'm gonna take the engine out now I

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.819 
well I'm gonna take the engine out now I
got<00:00:37.480> everything<00:00:37.720> disconnected<00:00:38.410> took<00:00:38.769> a

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
got everything disconnected took a

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.549 
got everything disconnected took a
little<00:00:38.949> longer<00:00:39.220> than<00:00:39.340> I<00:00:39.610> expected<00:00:39.699> but<00:00:40.559> not

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
little longer than I expected but not

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:56.920 
little longer than I expected but not
that<00:00:41.739> bad

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.040 

thing<00:00:57.500> looks<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.890> lot<00:00:58.640> sturdier<00:00:59.030> than<00:00:59.270> an<00:00:59.780> ATC

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.079 

just<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.559> lot<00:01:03.739> more<00:01:03.920> metal<00:01:04.400> probably<00:01:04.909> weighs<00:01:05.030> a

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
just a lot more metal probably weighs a

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.960 
just a lot more metal probably weighs a
lot<00:01:05.300> more<00:01:06.430> just<00:01:07.430> box<00:01:07.729> frame<00:01:08.030> 2

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.250 

so<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:13.200> 85<00:01:13.950> 125<00:01:14.700> m<00:01:14.910> in<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.270> I'm

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
so now I got 85 125 m in here I'm

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.510 
so now I got 85 125 m in here I'm
starting<00:01:16.620> to<00:01:16.650> take<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:16.980> the<00:01:17.100> engine<00:01:18.230> so<00:01:19.230> I<00:01:19.260> can

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
starting to take out the engine so I can

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.450 
starting to take out the engine so I can
start<00:01:20.520> putting<00:01:20.730> this<00:01:20.880> via<00:01:21.090> stem<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:22.460> think

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
start putting this via stem I think

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
start putting this via stem I think
everything<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.030> gonna<00:01:24.120> work<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.480> just<00:01:24.540> fine

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
everything is gonna work out just fine

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.170 
everything is gonna work out just fine
the<00:01:25.470> intake<00:01:26.070> manifold<00:01:26.520> might<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.790> different

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the intake manifold might be different

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.680 
the intake manifold might be different
but<00:01:27.740> if<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.010> I<00:01:29.160> can<00:01:29.190> just<00:01:29.430> switch<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.690> it

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
but if it is I can just switch it it

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.440 
but if it is I can just switch it it
honestly<00:01:31.230> might<00:01:31.410> not<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.040> think<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> 110

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
honestly might not be I think the 110

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
honestly might not be I think the 110
and<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> 125<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.680> different<00:01:35.010> but<00:01:36.350> other<00:01:37.350> than

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and the 125 are different but other than

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
and the 125 are different but other than
that<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.980> holes<00:01:38.160> should<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.850> same

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that all the holes should be the same

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.830 
that all the holes should be the same
and<00:01:40.910> starter<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.030> everything's<00:01:42.330> probably<00:01:42.780> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and starter and everything's probably in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.310 
and starter and everything's probably in
the<00:01:42.930> same<00:01:43.050> location<00:01:44.330> so<00:01:45.330> it's<00:01:46.050> gonna<00:01:46.170> be

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the same location so it's gonna be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.520 
the same location so it's gonna be
pretty<00:01:46.650> easy<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:49.050> then<00:01:49.350> I'm<00:01:49.440> gonna

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
pretty easy and then I'm gonna

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
pretty easy and then I'm gonna
make<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> electric<00:01:51.150> starting<00:01:51.450> everything

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
make the electric starting everything

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.270 
make the electric starting everything
work<00:01:51.870> too<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.440> that'll<00:01:52.590> be<00:01:52.740> cool<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
work too so that'll be cool get a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
work too so that'll be cool get a
battery<00:01:53.580> for<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.170> alright<00:01:55.170> gentlemen<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:57.210> got

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
battery for it alright gentlemen we got

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.270 
battery for it alright gentlemen we got
the<00:01:57.479> two<00:01:57.600> engine<00:01:57.960> side-by-side<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.920> kind<00:01:59.220> of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the two engine side-by-side here kind of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
the two engine side-by-side here kind of
comparing<00:01:59.670> them<00:02:00.830> looks<00:02:01.830> like<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
comparing them looks like all this this

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.540 
comparing them looks like all this this
is<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.050> Stata<00:02:04.320> wiring<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.010> like<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
is the Stata wiring and like the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.210 
is the Stata wiring and like the
charging<00:02:05.970> system<00:02:06.530> these<00:02:07.530> plugs<00:02:07.920> look

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
charging system these plugs look

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.210 
charging system these plugs look
identical<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:10.229> I'm<00:02:10.350> not<00:02:10.500> worried<00:02:10.770> about<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
identical so I'm not worried about that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.120 
identical so I'm not worried about that
and<00:02:11.940> also<00:02:12.230> there<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.860> reverse

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
and also there this is the reverse

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.940 
and also there this is the reverse
switch<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.820> can't<00:02:15.030> start<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.480> Reverse

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
switch that you can't start in Reverse

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.930 
switch that you can't start in Reverse
obviously<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.040> doesn't<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.520> so

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
obviously this doesn't have that so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.490 
obviously this doesn't have that so
there's<00:02:18.120> nothing<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.390> plug<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> don't

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
there's nothing to plug it in to don't

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.660 
there's nothing to plug it in to don't
need<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.709> worry<00:02:19.830> about<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.459> ground

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
need to worry about it's just a ground

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.740 
need to worry about it's just a ground
for<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.080> can't<00:02:22.260> start<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
for so you can't start it this is the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.570 
for so you can't start it this is the
pulse<00:02:24.959> generator<00:02:25.170> plug<00:02:25.560> off<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> t-rex<00:02:26.070> and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
pulse generator plug off the t-rex and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.699 
pulse generator plug off the t-rex and
this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.239> pulse<00:02:27.480> generator<00:02:27.660> plug<00:02:28.110> off<00:02:28.380> of

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
this is the pulse generator plug off of

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.310 
this is the pulse generator plug off of
the<00:02:29.040> APC

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
the APC

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.750 
the APC
yes

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
yes

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.420 
yes
it<00:02:33.390> would<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.599> cool<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.470> helped<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.310> any

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
it would be cool if this helped in any

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.929 
it would be cool if this helped in any
way<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.650> even<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.860> same<00:02:38.010> wires<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.640> it

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
way it's not even the same wires but it

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.819 
way it's not even the same wires but it
does<00:02:39.150> not<00:02:39.829> so<00:02:41.090> I'm<00:02:42.090> gonna<00:02:42.269> switch<00:02:42.599> out<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.079> the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
does not so I'm gonna switch out the the

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.550 
does not so I'm gonna switch out the the
pulse<00:02:44.069> generator<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.599> actually<00:02:45.750> looks

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
pulse generator and it actually looks

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.949 
pulse generator and it actually looks
like<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.129> had<00:02:47.340> some<00:02:47.549> metal<00:02:47.849> in<00:02:47.909> it<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.390> it

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
like this one had some metal in it so it

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.420 
like this one had some metal in it so it
might<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.200> better<00:02:49.829> than<00:02:50.010> I'm<00:02:50.099> doing<00:02:50.129> this

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
might be better than I'm doing this

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.809 
might be better than I'm doing this
anyway<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.450> need<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> replace<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.819> little

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
anyway I just need to replace the little

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.410 
anyway I just need to replace the little
guy<00:02:53.970> there

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
guy there

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.930 
guy there
it<00:02:55.319> looks<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.829> intake<00:02:56.159> is<00:02:56.459> pretty<00:02:56.819> much

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
it looks like the intake is pretty much

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.030 
it looks like the intake is pretty much
the<00:02:57.090> same<00:02:57.409> the<00:02:58.409> numbers<00:02:58.769> are<00:02:58.920> almost

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
the same the numbers are almost

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.860 
the same the numbers are almost
identical<00:02:59.640> except<00:02:59.879> that<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.060> says<00:03:00.299> 1<00:03:00.510> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
identical except that this says 1 and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.559 
identical except that this says 1 and
this<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.170> 2<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.549> shape<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> distance

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
this is 2 but the shape and the distance

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.280 
this is 2 but the shape and the distance
between<00:03:03.629> everything<00:03:04.109> looks<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.470> same<00:03:06.290> this

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
between everything looks the same this

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.550 
between everything looks the same this
is<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:08.010> know<00:03:08.129> way<00:03:08.370> massive<00:03:08.909> obviously<00:03:09.780> this

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
is you know way massive obviously this

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.699 
is you know way massive obviously this
is<00:03:10.680> very<00:03:10.889> massive<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:12.200> I'm<00:03:13.200> not<00:03:13.349> too<00:03:13.500> worried

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
is very massive and I'm not too worried

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.230 
is very massive and I'm not too worried
about<00:03:13.739> it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.250 

really<00:03:21.240> don't<00:03:21.450> see<00:03:21.720> any<00:03:21.840> reason<00:03:22.110> why<00:03:22.200> this

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
really don't see any reason why this

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.690 
really don't see any reason why this
won't<00:03:22.590> work<00:03:22.940> then<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.000> gonna<00:03:24.090> put<00:03:25.550> put<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
won't work then I'm gonna put put the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.260 
won't work then I'm gonna put put the
tires<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.180> came<00:03:27.450> with<00:03:27.630> back<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:29.240> give<00:03:30.240> a

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
tires that came with back on it give a

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.780 
tires that came with back on it give a
good<00:03:31.050> gas<00:03:31.260> tank<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:31.890> she'll<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.520> and

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
good gas tank on it she'll like that and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.320 
good gas tank on it she'll like that and
Stitch<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.810> front<00:03:34.050> plastics<00:03:34.970> get<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> battery

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
Stitch the front plastics get a battery

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.820 
Stitch the front plastics get a battery
for<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.870> then<00:03:37.020> this<00:03:37.170> should<00:03:37.320> be<00:03:37.380> an

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
for it and then this should be an

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.580 
for it and then this should be an
awesome<00:03:38.690> underwater<00:03:39.690> beast<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.200> thing<00:03:40.380> runs

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
awesome underwater beast this thing runs

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.110 
awesome underwater beast this thing runs
really<00:03:40.860> good<00:03:41.510> then<00:03:42.510> they're<00:03:42.750> perfect<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:44.250> very

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
really good then they're perfect so very

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.230 
really good then they're perfect so very
much<00:03:45.360> looking<00:03:45.630> forward<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.930> this

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.860 

so<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:49.460> got<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.580> engine<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.540> I'm<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:51.780> I

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
so I got the engine in and I'm if I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.740 
so I got the engine in and I'm if I
showed<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.350> yet<00:03:53.300> I've<00:03:54.300> got<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> engine

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
showed you this yet I've got the engine

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.060 
showed you this yet I've got the engine
in<00:03:55.760> got<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.940> exhaust<00:03:57.210> on<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:58.680> electrical

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
in got the exhaust on the electrical

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.720 
in got the exhaust on the electrical
works<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.520> headlight<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.910> turns<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:01.730> the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
works a headlight it turns on the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.050 
works a headlight it turns on the
neutral<00:04:03.150> light<00:04:03.300> lights<00:04:03.540> up<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:05.130> spark<00:04:05.490> it

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
neutral light lights up that spark it

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.160 
neutral light lights up that spark it
drums<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.410> frame<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:09.600> did<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:09.990> drive

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
drums in this frame it did just drive

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.570 
drums in this frame it did just drive
this<00:04:10.350> engine<00:04:10.680> earlier<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.130> TRX<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:13.580> maybe

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
this engine earlier in the TRX but maybe

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.740 
this engine earlier in the TRX but maybe
if<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:14.820> was<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.000> kid<00:04:15.210> that<00:04:15.240> thing<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:15.660> be

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
if I was a kid that thing would be

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.020 
if I was a kid that thing would be
awesome<00:04:16.110> but<00:04:17.060> it's<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.270> not<00:04:18.450> for<00:04:18.510> me

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
awesome but it's just not for me

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.190 
awesome but it's just not for me
and<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.150> three<00:04:21.330> wheeler<00:04:21.510> guys<00:04:21.750> that's<00:04:22.020> got

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
and a three wheeler guys that's got

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.600 
and a three wheeler guys that's got
something<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.500> do<00:04:22.620> with<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.010> yeah

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
something to do with it so yeah

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.220 
something to do with it so yeah
everything<00:04:23.880> seems<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.690> be<00:04:24.750> working<00:04:24.810> great

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
everything seems to be working great

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.590 
everything seems to be working great
jokes<00:04:25.560> whipped<00:04:25.770> up

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600 

I<00:04:29.720> think<00:04:30.230> I'm<00:04:30.320> just<00:04:30.440> gonna<00:04:30.530> wire<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.920> reverse

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
I think I'm just gonna wire the reverse

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.360 
I think I'm just gonna wire the reverse
so<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:33.020> can<00:04:33.170> always<00:04:33.320> go<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.950> right<00:04:34.190> into

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
so that you can always go it right into

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.250 
so that you can always go it right into
reverse<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:37.000> I've<00:04:38.000> got<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.180> 125<00:04:38.720> mm<00:04:39.020> tank

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
reverse and I've got a 125 mm tank

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.240 
reverse and I've got a 125 mm tank
therefore<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.860> doesn't<00:04:40.520> leak<00:04:41.920> I'm<00:04:42.920> gonna<00:04:43.070> get

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
therefore it doesn't leak I'm gonna get

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.220 
therefore it doesn't leak I'm gonna get
better<00:04:43.700> tires<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.480> think<00:04:44.720> I'm<00:04:44.900> gonna<00:04:44.990> take

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
better tires on I think I'm gonna take

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.560 
better tires on I think I'm gonna take
this<00:04:46.220> stock<00:04:46.640> you<00:04:47.650> know<00:04:48.650> program<00:04:49.610> front<00:04:50.390> tire

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
this stock you know program front tire

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.210 
this stock you know program front tire
it's<00:04:50.720> what<00:04:50.870> they<00:04:50.960> can't<00:04:51.200> wait<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.650> think<00:04:52.070> I'm

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
it's what they can't wait I think I'm

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.650 
it's what they can't wait I think I'm
gonna<00:04:52.310> put<00:04:52.520> through<00:04:52.760> them<00:04:53.000> because<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.510> have

00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:30.119 
you generally have messed with this

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:35.239 
you generally have messed with this
thing<00:05:30.389> and<00:05:32.809> it's<00:05:33.809> like<00:05:33.959> the<00:05:34.229> tuba<00:05:34.949> connects

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.249

the<00:05:35.369> airbox<00:05:35.729> to<00:05:36.059> the<00:05:36.179> carburetor<00:05:36.509> and<00:05:36.899> at<00:05:37.619> this

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:37.829 
the airbox to the carburetor and at this

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:39.229 
the airbox to the carburetor and at this
point<00:05:38.069> they're<00:05:38.249> so<00:05:38.429> old<00:05:38.639> they<00:05:38.879> get<00:05:39.029> really

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:39.239 
point they're so old they get really

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:41.399 
hard it's hard to to get them on

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.809 
hard it's hard to to get them on
and<00:05:41.579> off<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:41.819> carb<00:05:42.059> so<00:05:42.449> basically<00:05:43.610> put<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.729> in

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819 
and off the carb so basically put it in

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.089 
and off the carb so basically put it in
the<00:05:44.879> Sun<00:05:45.119> or<00:05:45.689> put<00:05:46.259> it<00:05:46.319> on<00:05:46.349> top<00:05:46.589> of<00:05:46.739> your<00:05:46.889> engine

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
the Sun or put it on top of your engine

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.059 
the Sun or put it on top of your engine
or<00:05:47.669> something<00:05:47.959> warmed<00:05:48.959> it<00:05:49.019> up<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.409> it's<00:05:49.949> like

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
or something warmed it up and it's like

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.109 
or something warmed it up and it's like
butter<00:05:50.309> than<00:05:50.549> easiest<00:05:52.369> so<00:05:53.369> one<00:05:53.849> thing<00:05:54.029> I

00:05:54.109 --> 00:05:54.119 
butter than easiest so one thing I

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.789 
butter than easiest so one thing I
found<00:05:54.299> out<00:05:54.509> is<00:05:54.569> even<00:05:55.019> though<00:05:55.229> every<00:05:55.619> single

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:55.799 
found out is even though every single

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:58.639 
found out is even though every single
Honda<00:05:56.309> 3<00:05:56.519> wheeler<00:05:56.729> is<00:05:56.969> different<00:05:57.469> pretty<00:05:58.469> much

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:58.649 
Honda 3 wheeler is different pretty much

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.449 
Honda 3 wheeler is different pretty much
I<00:05:58.889> mean<00:05:58.919> that<00:05:59.339> well<00:05:59.549> the<00:05:59.639> 125<00:06:00.239> m<00:06:00.629> and<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:02.039> 110

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:02.459 
I mean that well the 125 m and the 110

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:04.549 
I mean that well the 125 m and the 110
are<00:06:02.819> obviously<00:06:03.269> and<00:06:03.569> then<00:06:03.989> the<00:06:04.049> hind<00:06:04.229> II<00:06:04.349> are

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:04.559 
are obviously and then the hind II are

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.709 
are obviously and then the hind II are
all<00:06:04.709> pretty<00:06:04.919> much<00:06:05.069> identical<00:06:05.360> in<00:06:06.360> a<00:06:06.479> crazy

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
all pretty much identical in a crazy

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.889 
all pretty much identical in a crazy
amount<00:06:07.049> of<00:06:07.079> ways<00:06:07.259> but<00:06:08.449> all<00:06:09.449> the<00:06:09.569> other<00:06:09.689> models

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:09.899 
amount of ways but all the other models

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:12.019 
amount of ways but all the other models
are<00:06:10.169> like<00:06:10.319> so<00:06:10.559> freaking<00:06:10.919> differently<00:06:11.399> no

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
are like so freaking differently no

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.299 
are like so freaking differently no
parts<00:06:12.449> are<00:06:12.569> really<00:06:12.659> interchangeable<00:06:13.409> with

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:14.309 
parts are really interchangeable with

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.339 
parts are really interchangeable with
the<00:06:14.429> t-rex<00:06:14.699> 125<00:06:15.479> in<00:06:15.629> this<00:06:15.749> thing<00:06:15.959> but<00:06:16.139> these

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
the t-rex 125 in this thing but these

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.459 
the t-rex 125 in this thing but these
exact<00:06:16.769> same<00:06:16.799> airbox<00:06:17.509> and<00:06:18.509> the<00:06:18.959> exact<00:06:19.259> same

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
exact same airbox and the exact same

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.629 
exact same airbox and the exact same
tube<00:06:19.799> and<00:06:20.159> carburetor<00:06:21.079> so<00:06:22.079> there's<00:06:22.349> a<00:06:22.679> lot<00:06:23.489> of

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
tube and carburetor so there's a lot of

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.109 
tube and carburetor so there's a lot of
similarities<00:06:24.209> between<00:06:24.449> the<00:06:24.749> TRX<00:06:25.169> and<00:06:26.119> agency

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:27.119 
similarities between the TRX and agency

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:32.680 
similarities between the TRX and agency
which<00:06:27.299> I<00:06:27.539> was<00:06:27.689> really<00:06:27.809> surprised<00:06:28.229> about

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.150 

so<00:06:33.170> I'm<00:06:33.230> gonna<00:06:33.380> finish<00:06:33.560> trying<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.950> get<00:06:34.070> this

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
so I'm gonna finish trying to get this

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.740 
so I'm gonna finish trying to get this
thing<00:06:34.220> back<00:06:34.490> together<00:06:34.670> tonight<00:06:35.090> and<00:06:35.300> maybe<00:06:35.600> I

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
thing back together tonight and maybe I

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.080 
thing back together tonight and maybe I
can<00:06:35.870> ride<00:06:36.050> it
