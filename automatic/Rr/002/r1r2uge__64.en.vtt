00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
it behooves you to create a template and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
use that template to create the page so

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.029 
use that template to create the page so
for<00:00:14.820> example<00:00:14.880> each<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:16.020> these<00:00:16.139> gallery<00:00:16.740> pages

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
for example each of these gallery pages

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.910 
for example each of these gallery pages
were<00:00:17.760> created<00:00:18.300> using<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> same<00:00:19.140> template

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920

were created using the same template
file<00:00:20.660> templates<00:00:21.660> work<00:00:21.900> especially<00:00:22.260> well<00:00:22.680> when

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
file templates work especially well when

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
of the page here was created in a way

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
of the page here was created in a way
that<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.340> altered<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.120> each<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> pages

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that can be altered on each of the pages

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.700 
that can be altered on each of the pages
created<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> template<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.710> similar

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
created from the template a similar

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.529 
created from the template a similar
approach<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:50.250> used<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> Galapagos

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
approach was used with the Galapagos

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
approach was used with the Galapagos
Island<00:00:51.930> site<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:53.010> continue<00:00:53.579> through<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
Island site as we continue through the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.880 
Island site as we continue through the
collection<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.480> images<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:55.230> you'll<00:00:55.710> notice

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
collection of images here you'll notice

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
collection of images here you'll notice
that<00:00:56.219> they're<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.610> done<00:00:57.059> exactly<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.899> same

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that they're all done exactly the same

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.010 
that they're all done exactly the same
way<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> again<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> done<00:01:00.359> by<00:01:00.539> combining

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
way and again this is done by combining

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.880 
way and again this is done by combining
CSS<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.820> templates<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.660> Dreamweaver<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
CSS with templates and Dreamweaver so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.380 
CSS with templates and Dreamweaver so
that<00:01:05.040> all<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.369> pages<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.970> created

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that all of these pages can be created

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.929 
that all of these pages can be created
very<00:01:06.630> quickly<00:01:06.960> very<00:01:07.290> efficiently<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> then

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
very quickly very efficiently and then

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.140 
very quickly very efficiently and then
later<00:01:09.330> updated<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.380> changed<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.909> quickly

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
later updated or changed just as quickly

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450 
later updated or changed just as quickly
and<00:01:12.360> efficiently<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:13.409> anything<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and efficiently because anything at the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600 
and efficiently because anything at the
top<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.810> bottom<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> page<00:01:16.710> which<00:01:17.400> is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
top or the bottom of the page which is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.060 
top or the bottom of the page which is
set<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.659> changed<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.409> individual

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
set not to be changed on the individual

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.539 
set not to be changed on the individual
pages<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.090> changed<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> template<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
pages can be changed on the template and

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
pages can be changed on the template and
automatically<00:01:23.549> updated<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
pages so if someday in the future you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
pages so if someday in the future you
decide<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> different<00:01:28.770> banner<00:01:29.250> image

the year changes to 2009 you can easily

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.010 
the year changes to 2009 you can easily
make<00:01:37.890> those<00:01:38.189> changes<00:01:38.460> once<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.600> template

make those changes once in the template

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.560 
make those changes once in the template
file<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.729> automatically<00:01:41.729> update<00:01:42.270> them<00:01:42.450> on

all of the subsequent pages you've

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
all of the subsequent pages you've
created<00:01:45.149> from<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.200> template<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> can

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
created from that template so you can

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
created from that template so you can
save<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.909> lot<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.360> time<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.960> trouble<00:01:49.020> using
