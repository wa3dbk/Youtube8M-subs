00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
applying even pressure so we're working

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.080

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
and these mats are fantastic they don't

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.360

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.199 
the whole piece over and roll some more
and<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.830> will<00:03:53.980> keep<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.310> from<00:03:54.580> sticking<00:03:54.880> to

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
and that will keep it from sticking to

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.570 
and that will keep it from sticking to
the<00:03:55.360> mat<00:03:55.540> I'm<00:03:56.230> trying<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.770> get<00:03:56.920> as<00:03:57.100> much<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.489> a

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
the mat I'm trying to get as much of a

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.340 
the mat I'm trying to get as much of a
circle<00:03:57.940> as<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.209> can<00:03:58.510> here<00:03:58.840> but<00:03:59.050> don't<00:03:59.230> be

circle as I can here but don't be

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.960 
circle as I can here but don't be
concerned<00:03:59.709> if<00:03:59.890> it's<00:04:00.040> not<00:04:00.220> perfect<00:04:00.250> because

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
concerned if it's not perfect because

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.840 
concerned if it's not perfect because
you<00:04:01.209> are<00:04:01.390> going<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.600> be<00:04:01.690> trimming<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.230> edge

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
you are going to be trimming the edge

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.790 
you are going to be trimming the edge
your<00:04:03.850> goal<00:04:04.120> here<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.690> have<00:04:04.989> this<00:04:05.290> piece<00:04:05.590> of

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
your goal here is to have this piece of

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.180 
your goal here is to have this piece of
fondant<00:04:06.209> cover<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:07.510> cake<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.980> at<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.160> very

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
fondant cover this cake so at a very

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.310 
fondant cover this cake so at a very
important<00:04:10.030> tip<00:04:10.330> is<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.870> want<00:04:11.140> to

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
important tip is that you want to

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.790 
important tip is that you want to
actually<00:04:11.500> measure<00:04:12.220> with<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.330> measuring<00:04:14.230> tape<00:04:14.440> a

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
actually measure with a measuring tape a

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.490 
actually measure with a measuring tape a
little<00:04:15.310> rule<00:04:15.880> or<00:04:16.060> anything<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.510> have<00:04:16.720> how

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
little rule or anything you have how

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.190 
little rule or anything you have how
many<00:04:17.560> inches<00:04:17.919> up<00:04:18.220> one<00:04:18.400> side<00:04:18.810> how<00:04:19.810> many<00:04:19.989> inches

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
many inches up one side how many inches

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.070 
many inches up one side how many inches
across<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.100> how<00:04:21.940> many<00:04:22.120> inches<00:04:22.330> down<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:22.960> add

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
across and how many inches down and add

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.800 
across and how many inches down and add
it<00:04:23.260> together<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> I'm<00:04:24.790> guessing<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.480> this<00:04:25.630> is

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
it together so I'm guessing that this is

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.100 
it together so I'm guessing that this is
going<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.050> be<00:04:26.200> about<00:04:26.350> 14<00:04:27.280> inches<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:28.660> we<00:04:28.840> want<00:04:29.050> a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
going to be about 14 inches so we want a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.590 
going to be about 14 inches so we want a
circle<00:04:29.620> that's<00:04:29.919> at<00:04:30.130> least<00:04:30.160> 14<00:04:30.789> inches<00:04:31.090> large

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
circle that's at least 14 inches large

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.320 
circle that's at least 14 inches large
to<00:04:31.930> cover<00:04:32.170> it<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.440> one<00:04:32.710> piece<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:33.640> this<00:04:34.060> mat<00:04:34.300> is

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
to cover it in one piece so this mat is

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.410 
to cover it in one piece so this mat is
marked<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.590> looks<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:36.120> we're<00:04:37.120> good<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
marked and it looks like we're good to

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.630 
marked and it looks like we're good to
go<00:04:37.450> all<00:04:38.320> right<00:04:38.530> our<00:04:38.680> fondant<00:04:39.070> is<00:04:39.190> all<00:04:39.400> rolled

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
go all right our fondant is all rolled

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640 
go all right our fondant is all rolled
out<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.150> approximate<00:04:40.810> size<00:04:40.990> we<00:04:41.290> need<00:04:41.320> to

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
out to the approximate size we need to

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.970 
out to the approximate size we need to
cover<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:42.100> entire<00:04:42.280> layer<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.390> cake<00:04:43.630> an<00:04:43.980> easy

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
cover this entire layer of cake an easy

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.500 
cover this entire layer of cake an easy

all you need is just a little dab of

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.610 
all you need is just a little dab of
water<00:06:49.060> so<00:06:49.629> I<00:06:49.659> just<00:06:49.870> want<00:06:50.050> to<00:06:50.139> figure<00:06:50.259> out<00:06:50.469> where

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
water so I just want to figure out where

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.110 
water so I just want to figure out where
the<00:06:50.770> placement<00:06:51.189> is<00:06:51.249> going<00:06:51.400> to<00:06:51.460> be<00:06:51.550> on<00:06:51.729> here<00:06:52.060> and

the placement is going to be on here and

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.159 
the placement is going to be on here and
I'm<00:06:52.210> just<00:06:52.240> going<00:06:52.479> to<00:06:52.599> go<00:06:52.689> a<00:06:52.719> little<00:06:52.900> off-center

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.170 
I'm just going to go a little off-center
I<00:06:53.560> think<00:06:53.889> on<00:06:54.009> this<00:06:54.159> one<00:06:54.219> so<00:06:54.759> a<00:06:54.789> little<00:06:54.999> bit<00:06:55.120> of

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
I think on this one so a little bit of

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.300 
I think on this one so a little bit of
water<00:06:55.389> and<00:06:55.749> that<00:06:56.050> will<00:06:56.259> kind<00:06:57.099> of<00:06:57.159> make<00:06:57.279> a

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
water and that will kind of make a

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.629 
water and that will kind of make a
little<00:06:57.370> glue<00:06:57.759> in<00:06:57.909> between<00:06:59.189> I'm<00:07:00.189> going<00:07:00.370> to<00:07:00.430> pull

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 
little glue in between I'm going to pull

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.070 
little glue in between I'm going to pull
these<00:07:00.789> up<00:07:00.849> a<00:07:01.090> little<00:07:01.120> bit<00:07:01.479> make<00:07:01.810> it<00:07:01.840> a<00:07:01.960> little

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
these up a little bit make it a little

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.989 
these up a little bit make it a little
bit<00:07:02.259> more<00:07:02.379> three-dimensional<00:07:03.099> a<00:07:03.279> good<00:07:03.729> press
