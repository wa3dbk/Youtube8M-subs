00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
boom watch this I use rest and I heal up

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.320 
boom watch this I use rest and I heal up
and<00:02:51.660> i<00:02:52.590> activate<00:02:53.160> my<00:02:53.310> chest<00:02:53.610> o<00:02:53.760> berry<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.090> with

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
and i activate my chest o berry and with

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.910 
and i activate my chest o berry and with
the<00:02:54.420> unburden<00:02:54.960> ability<00:02:55.380> which<00:02:55.620> raises

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
the unburden ability which raises

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.400 
the unburden ability which raises
drifblim<00:02:56.310> speed<00:02:57.000> temporarily<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.200> it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
drifblim speed temporarily so that it

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.320 
drifblim speed temporarily so that it
can<00:02:58.530> most<00:02:58.770> likely<00:02:58.890> go<00:02:59.370> first<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.880> almost<00:03:00.030> all

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
can most likely go first in almost all

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.510 
can most likely go first in almost all
cases<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.930> now<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.380> use<00:03:01.860> will-o-wisp<00:03:02.100> I

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
cases like now I use will-o-wisp I

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.210 
cases like now I use will-o-wisp I
burned<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:04.170> yeah<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.650> Gators<00:03:04.950> burned

just<00:03:16.860> keep<00:03:17.190> drifblim<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.790> later<00:03:18.090> maybe<00:03:18.989> he'll

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
just keep drifblim in later maybe he'll

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.229 
just keep drifblim in later maybe he'll
be<00:03:19.320> good<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.860> figure<00:03:20.190> another<00:03:20.400> ice<00:03:20.880> punch

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
be good but I figure another ice punch

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.970 
be good but I figure another ice punch
is<00:03:21.360> coming<00:03:21.630> my<00:03:21.750> way<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.590> send<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.920> a

is coming my way so I send it a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.010 
is coming my way so I send it a
feraligatr<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.550> my<00:03:23.640> own<00:03:23.790> cruncher<00:03:24.390> yeah<00:03:24.750> you

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
feraligatr of my own cruncher yeah you

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.190 
feraligatr of my own cruncher yeah you
all<00:03:25.140> know<00:03:25.260> cruncher<00:03:25.620> by<00:03:25.709> now<00:03:25.860> she<00:03:27.080> comes<00:03:28.080> in

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
all know cruncher by now she comes in

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.890 
all know cruncher by now she comes in
handy<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.470> lot<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.980> he<00:03:29.220> his<00:03:30.030> fur<00:03:30.450> alligator<00:03:30.780> it

handy a lot so he his fur alligator it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.870 
handy a lot so he his fur alligator it
uses<00:03:31.170> dragon<00:03:31.500> dance<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.640> get<00:03:32.790> an

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
uses dragon dance just to get an

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.610 
uses dragon dance just to get an
earthquake<00:03:33.239> on<00:03:33.360> mine<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.170> does<00:03:34.350> half

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
earthquake on mine and it does half

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.050 
earthquake on mine and it does half
which<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.010> pretty<00:03:35.100> good<00:03:35.220> I'll<00:03:35.459> dragon<00:03:35.850> dance

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
which is pretty good I'll dragon dance

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.050 
which is pretty good I'll dragon dance
as<00:03:36.300> well<00:03:36.890> but<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.040> meantime<00:03:38.070> he<00:03:38.730> has<00:03:39.030> a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
as well but in the meantime he has a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.510 
as well but in the meantime he has a
bird<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:40.050> take<00:03:40.140> advantage<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.620> but

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
bird so I can take advantage of that but

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.580 
bird so I can take advantage of that but
the<00:03:41.760> next<00:03:42.000> turn<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.510> think<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.050> better<00:03:43.230> attack

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
the next turn I think I better attack

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.100 
the next turn I think I better attack
because<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.430> know<00:03:44.550> who<00:03:45.209> knows<00:03:45.330> I'm<00:03:45.660> hoping

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
because you know who knows I'm hoping

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.590 
because you know who knows I'm hoping
he'll<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.830> didn't<00:03:47.610> activate<00:03:47.880> my<00:03:48.030> lychee<00:03:48.420> Barry

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
he'll I didn't activate my lychee Barry

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.970 
he'll I didn't activate my lychee Barry
I<00:03:48.720> had<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> lychee<00:03:49.230> berry<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.769> would<00:03:49.890> have

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
I had a lychee berry and that would have

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.009 
I had a lychee berry and that would have
pumped<00:03:50.310> my<00:03:50.459> attack<00:03:50.670> even<00:03:50.850> more<00:03:51.120> but<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.780> didn't

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
pumped my attack even more but I didn't

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.020 
pumped my attack even more but I didn't
get<00:03:52.140> low<00:03:52.530> enough<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:53.220> activate<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:53.790> anyway

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
get low enough to activate it so anyway

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.190 
get low enough to activate it so anyway
he's<00:03:54.180> burned<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.690> he<00:03:54.870> keeps<00:03:54.989> using

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
he's burned and he keeps using

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.320 
he's burned and he keeps using
earthquakes<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.010> don't<00:03:56.220> want<00:03:56.370> cruncher<00:03:57.209> to

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
earthquakes so I don't want cruncher to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.180 
earthquakes so I don't want cruncher to
be<00:03:57.450> taking<00:03:57.780> down<00:03:57.930> right<00:03:58.140> now<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.890> I'll<00:03:58.980> switch

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
be taking down right now so I'll switch

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.340 
be taking down right now so I'll switch
to<00:03:59.220> nimbus<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.209> he's<00:04:00.480> earthquake<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.140> like

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
to nimbus and he's earthquake just like

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.180 
to nimbus and he's earthquake just like
I<00:04:01.470> predicted<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:03.620> yeah<00:04:04.620> he's<00:04:04.860> suffering<00:04:05.160> from

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
I predicted and yeah he's suffering from

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.520 
I predicted and yeah he's suffering from
that<00:04:05.430> burn<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.480> now<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.930> don't<00:04:07.290> think<00:04:07.470> I

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
that burn and so now I don't think I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.750 
that burn and so now I don't think I
need<00:04:07.590> really<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:07.950> don't<00:04:08.100> really<00:04:08.220> need<00:04:08.459> Nimbus

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
need really I don't really need Nimbus

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.100 
need really I don't really need Nimbus
anymore<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.390> more<00:04:09.600> important<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.959> keep

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
anymore it's more important to keep

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.500 
anymore it's more important to keep
crunching<00:04:10.350> for<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.190> late<00:04:11.370> game<00:04:11.580> so<00:04:12.269> I<00:04:12.300> let

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
crunching for the late game so I let

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.789 
crunching for the late game so I let
Nimbus<00:04:13.140> go<00:04:13.260> down<00:04:13.730> porn<00:04:14.730> in<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:15.500> but<00:04:16.500> his<00:04:16.590> file

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
Nimbus go down porn in this but his file

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.840 
Nimbus go down porn in this but his file
Gator<00:04:17.040> goes<00:04:17.220> down<00:04:17.400> as<00:04:17.519> well<00:04:17.669> weird<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:19.430> so<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
Gator goes down as well weird or so the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.320 
Gator goes down as well weird or so the
burn<00:04:21.000> took<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.330> away<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.970> sort<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.030> ice<00:04:24.150> and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
burn took it away so I sort of ice and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.159 
burn took it away so I sort of ice and
now<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.600> sendin<00:04:25.200> ya<00:04:25.410> Gator

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
now I sendin ya Gator

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.930 
now I sendin ya Gator
cruncher<00:04:27.169> cruncher<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.160> he<00:04:28.400> sends<00:04:28.610> him<00:04:28.730> clean
