movements<00:01:06.770> there<00:01:07.220> from<00:01:07.460> Santos<00:01:08.000> but<00:01:08.390> I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
movements there from Santos but I

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.609 
movements there from Santos but I
believe<00:01:10.280> he's<00:01:10.490> scored<00:01:11.590> no<00:01:12.909> it's<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.060> Turkish

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
believe he's scored no it's the Turkish

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.950 
believe he's scored no it's the Turkish
competitor<00:01:15.619> who<00:01:15.710> earns<00:01:15.979> one<00:01:16.250> point<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.810> we're

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
competitor who earns one point and we're

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.230 
competitor who earns one point and we're
back<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:18.500> switch<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.340> was<00:01:19.520> just<00:01:20.000> about

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
back to this switch and I was just about

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.139 
back to this switch and I was just about
to<00:01:20.390> say<00:01:20.600> kaya<00:01:21.310> right-handed<00:01:22.310> as<00:01:22.430> well<00:01:22.610> his

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
to say kaya right-handed as well his

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.180 
to say kaya right-handed as well his
back<00:01:23.509> leg<00:01:23.869> will<00:01:24.110> be<00:01:24.229> his<00:01:24.470> biggest<00:01:24.799> weapon

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.030 

it<00:01:27.670> takes<00:01:27.940> longer<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.690> engage<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.380> back<00:01:29.680> leg

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
it takes longer to engage the back leg

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.400 
it takes longer to engage the back leg
to<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.400> body<00:01:30.640> then<00:01:31.480> it<00:01:31.600> does<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.930> front<00:01:32.140> leg

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
to the body then it does the front leg

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.250 
to the body then it does the front leg
so<00:01:32.590> Santos<00:01:33.070> will<00:01:33.250> have<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.460> speed<00:01:33.820> advantage

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
so Santos will have the speed advantage

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.320 
so Santos will have the speed advantage
but<00:01:35.260> his<00:01:35.410> right<00:01:35.590> hand<00:01:35.800> is<00:01:35.890> forward<00:01:36.330> now

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
but his right hand is forward now

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.400 
but his right hand is forward now
they're<00:01:37.510> both<00:01:37.720> have<00:01:37.960> their<00:01:38.110> right<00:01:38.230> hands

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
they're both have their right hands

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.570 
they're both have their right hands
forward<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:38.830> it'll<00:01:38.980> be<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.130> front<00:01:39.370> legs

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
forward so it'll be the front legs

00:01:39.580 --> 00:02:04.990 
forward so it'll be the front legs
engaging

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.550 

let's<00:02:05.600> see<00:02:05.810> how<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:05.960> judges<00:02:06.410> see<00:02:06.590> that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.980 

and<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.770> hurt<00:02:16.010> low<00:02:16.310> blow<00:02:16.550> by<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.990> turkish

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
and it hurt low blow by the turkish

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.390 
and it hurt low blow by the turkish
competitor<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:19.390> athletes<00:02:20.390> touch<00:02:20.660> gloves

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
competitor to athletes touch gloves

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.000 
competitor to athletes touch gloves
so<00:02:22.400> we're<00:02:22.520> back<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.260> right-handed<00:02:24.260> men<00:02:24.470> right

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010
