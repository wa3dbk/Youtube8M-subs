blues<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.640> form<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.120> dictated<00:00:57.780> by<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
blues the form is dictated by the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.819

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:31.550 
simply be improvisation on top of that
it<00:01:04.530> would<00:01:04.680> sound<00:01:04.860> something<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.369> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.890 
so there are eight bar blues 16 bar
blues<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.680> even<00:01:35.890> 32<00:01:36.460> bar<00:01:36.730> form<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:37.750> what

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.210 
you want to do is learn to play the
roots<00:01:39.910> for<00:01:40.810> each<00:01:40.960> chord<00:01:41.380> just<00:01:41.650> like<00:01:41.830> you<00:01:41.980> would

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
roots for each chord just like you would

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.550 
roots for each chord just like you would
as<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> bass<00:01:42.940> player<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.480> root<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.140> lowest

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
as a bass player the root is the lowest

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.670 
as a bass player the root is the lowest
note<00:01:44.800> of<00:01:44.980> each<00:01:45.130> chord<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:46.080> so<00:01:47.080> for<00:01:47.320> instance

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
note of each chord and so for instance

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
note of each chord and so for instance
in<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:48.130> 12<00:01:48.430> bar<00:01:48.580> blues<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.090> key<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.480> G<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
in a 12 bar blues in the key of G the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.100 
in a 12 bar blues in the key of G the
the<00:01:52.180> G<00:01:52.390> chord<00:01:52.630> also<00:01:53.050> known<00:01:53.470> as<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.860> one<00:01:54.130> chord

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the G chord also known as the one chord

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.920 
the G chord also known as the one chord
because<00:01:56.110> there<00:01:56.500> are<00:01:56.790> seven<00:01:57.790> notes<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.510> in<00:01:58.810> a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
because there are seven notes in it in a

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.800 
because there are seven notes in it in a
key<00:01:59.170> typically<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.190> seven<00:02:00.970> chords<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.570> one

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
key typically and seven chords the one

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.310 
key typically and seven chords the one
chord<00:02:02.230> in<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:03.550> key<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.850> G<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.390> G<00:02:04.780> chord<00:02:04.810> so

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
chord in the key of G is a G chord so

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.790 
chord in the key of G is a G chord so
you'd<00:02:05.470> play<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:06.070> G<00:02:06.820> for<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.900> one<00:02:08.290> chord<00:02:08.619> and

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
you'd play a G for the one chord and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.070 
you'd play a G for the one chord and
that's<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:10.000> draw

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.390 

and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.550> go<00:02:15.790> up<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.040> four<00:02:18.040> chord

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
and then you go up to the four chord

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
and then you go up to the four chord
which<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:19.150> blow<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.400> five<00:02:21.670> chord<00:02:22.090> or<00:02:22.240> one

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
which is one blow the five chord or one

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.250 
which is one blow the five chord or one
draw<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.870> 12<00:02:26.200> bar<00:02:26.440> blues<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:27.360> 12<00:02:28.360> bars<00:02:28.840> or

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
draw and the 12 bar blues is 12 bars or

over<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.620> over<00:02:32.800> again<00:02:34.050> let's<00:02:35.050> divide<00:02:35.410> this

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
over and over again let's divide this

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.250 
over and over again let's divide this
into<00:02:36.250> three<00:02:36.280> lines<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.360> first<00:02:37.600> line<00:02:37.930> being
