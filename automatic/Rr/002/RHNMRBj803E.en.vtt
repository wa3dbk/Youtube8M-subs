to<00:00:41.550> get<00:00:41.730> used<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.180> simpler<00:00:42.660> designs<00:00:43.140> first

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to get used with simpler designs first

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.209

like these flowers now before trying the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.200 
like these flowers now before trying the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
spiders so start as you usually start

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
spiders so start as you usually start
and<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> nice<00:00:52.230> round<00:00:52.469> centered<00:00:53.010> Maria<00:00:53.430> at

we<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.690> want<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.959> smooth<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.980> surface<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:39.030> we

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
we just want to smooth the surface so we

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.900 
we just want to smooth the surface so we
can<00:02:39.300> apply<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> next<00:02:40.080> segment<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.670> just

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
can apply the next segment so just

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.680 
can apply the next segment so just

everything nice and hard and finish your
implosion<00:04:56.630> as<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.080> normally<00:04:57.320> would

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
implosion as you normally would

the implosion my flattened design too
much<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:28.910> ruin<00:05:29.600> it

attention at the hole forming in the

attention at the hole forming in the
center<00:06:00.710> make<00:06:01.640> sure<00:06:01.820> it<00:06:01.940> doesn't<00:06:02.270> get<00:06:02.390> too<00:06:02.450> deep

center make sure it doesn't get too deep
this<00:06:04.460> is<00:06:04.520> how<00:06:04.790> it<00:06:04.910> should<00:06:04.970> close<00:06:05.510> and<00:06:07.150> this<00:06:08.150> is

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
this is how it should close and this is

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.740 
this is how it should close and this is
what<00:06:08.510> you<00:06:08.630> should<00:06:08.840> get<00:06:09.110> when<00:06:09.380> you're<00:06:09.590> done<00:06:09.890> I

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
what you should get when you're done I
