00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 very good us such as you are 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.720
 new video on this occasion we are another 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.080
 time here in another multiplayer guide here 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.350
 with my friend Ã¡lex as you are 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.600
 well nothing in this chapter in this 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.180
 episode that is the weight of 4 that like 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.830
 you always have the other episodes in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.259
 a playlist that is in the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.940
 description take up 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.540
 is 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.510
 in this episode as you see in titles 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.960
 I'm going to show you how to click on 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.030
 battlefield 4 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.860
 one very important thing is that you have 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.989
 to know that you're never going to kill in a 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.940
 bullet since the maximum damage they have 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.260
 the good snipers are not going to 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.090
 kill from a bullet unless you give him 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.810
 in the head or the enemy is very very 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.870
 touched since the snipers 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.940
 the maximum damage that 95-96 has 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.130
 depending on the sniper 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.990
 concatedral is that it has 94 per bullet 95 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.120
 worth 97 for example 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.550
 I do not know the damage I just know that this 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.620
 is the m 40 have 96 and nothing is very very 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.420
 easy you just have to have the enemy 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.750
 that is married sanz ex is that having it 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.670
 here 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400
 I have entered the four stripes that you 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.410
 appear when you point the hip and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.050
 you only have to aim as you see here 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.480
 he aimed directly the head pointed and 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.400
 Shooting 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.700
 you can now you have died of a 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.740
 head shot 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 now we are all clear since what 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.969
 I was pointing in the head but for 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 example if now comes a movement 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.159
 you can try to give it and surely not what 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.070
 mate in one shot 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:45.900
 where are you coming from and where are you always 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.900
 and it comes out a little 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.369
 when playing multiplayer I guess 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.969
 which is pretty much more difficult since 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.649
 that the enemies tell me the sandpaper 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.170
 also apart is that they are further away 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.509
 what of this time you can also 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.789
 shoot and nothing can also be moved 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.670
 from side to side this complicates you 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.350
 much more things so I eat 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.170
 you see here has failed again failed 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.330
 it hit the cupbearers 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.900
 today I gave him the co but since he did not give 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.250
 in the head was the Mallorcan marker 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.810
 I have left it to the minimum of health 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.060
 therefore we have to take out the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.190
 secondary than for sniper os 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.990
 I recommend bringing a secondary that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.380
 do at short distances such as can be 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.060
 this is the short and a shotgun 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.180
 with if not also 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.280
 and I do not want to also recommend 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.550
 carry the second one but a first one that 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.960
 already unblocks that is the 226 I think 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.680
 which is called nothing 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.530
 well that's also the drone the consell 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.300
 to manex the track is pop 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.950
 to move while on each side the player 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.680
 move the look 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.270
 move the east look of this in 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.010
 battlefield is very very difficult here in 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.350
 the havana you're looking at 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.550
 naval deviates a lot so to see 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.550
 pointed and fired 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.700
 well let's go to the third age in the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.040
 head therefore killed him a bullet 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.159
 above all you have to have 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.569
 present this that you are not going to kill in a 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.689
 bullet unless the enemy is touched 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.409
 it is directly in the head so 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.640
 nothing in the next chapter I guess 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.150
 what's it gonna be 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.840
 I'll do it alone 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.840
 yes nobody 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.260
 the next one surely of how to navigate 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.549
 by the servers how to search 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.450
 servers like navigating the menus 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.970
 etc etc 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.269
 since it is quite difficult if you do not 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.040
 you know although I do not know is pretty always 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.610
 navigate but good simple if you do not 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.940
 you know 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.610
 and I wrap a tutorial and it always works 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.240
 where will I be between patients that we are going to 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.240
 see what we ask 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.370
 so nothing will I see good and we 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.370
 we ask 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.780
 to see where you are 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.170
 Over there 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.990
 that 's where they buy 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.730
 it is not the map of a by the way also 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.860
 you will have the real channel is a 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.960
 description as always on twitter 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.920
 has also gone through its burden that has already 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.750
 uploaded a video 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.240
 according to when you see the best writer 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.030
 another one has already gone up and we'll see each other in the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.110
 following 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.290
 video 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.640
 have the tarrito quito software ready 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.640
 then it comes that they pretended to be missing 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.950
 well bye
