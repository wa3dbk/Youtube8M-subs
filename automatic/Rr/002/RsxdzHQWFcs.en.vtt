hi I'm Jean Peterson today we will learn
how<00:00:15.090> to<00:00:15.119> create<00:00:15.360> luminous<00:00:15.930> watercolors<00:00:16.560> by

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
how to create luminous watercolors by

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.400 
how to create luminous watercolors by
layering<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.369> wet<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:17.820> damp<00:00:18.119> paper<00:00:18.449> painting

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
layering on wet or damp paper painting

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.390 
layering on wet or damp paper painting
on<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> vertical<00:00:19.769> surface

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
on a vertical surface

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
on a vertical surface
I<00:00:20.609> find<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.689> technique<00:00:22.080> very<00:00:22.349> rewarding<00:00:22.890> as

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
I find this technique very rewarding as

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.370 
I find this technique very rewarding as
it<00:00:23.580> allows<00:00:23.759> me<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.480> adjust<00:00:24.599> color<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it allows me to adjust color and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.710 
it allows me to adjust color and
temperature<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.279> manipulate<00:00:26.789> paint<00:00:27.300> by

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
temperature to manipulate paint by

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.300 
temperature to manipulate paint by
lifting<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.259> placing<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> paint<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
lifting or placing the paint in the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.300 
lifting or placing the paint in the
appropriate<00:00:29.730> areas<00:00:30.410> here<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.499> an<00:00:31.650> example<00:00:32.009> of

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
appropriate areas here is an example of

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.490 
appropriate areas here is an example of
a<00:00:32.550> rich<00:00:32.759> luminous<00:00:33.360> still<00:00:33.600> life<00:00:33.810> of<00:00:33.990> grapes<00:00:34.260> in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a rich luminous still life of grapes in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.340 
a rich luminous still life of grapes in
which<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.309> technique<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.350> these

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
which I use this technique in these

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040 
which I use this technique in these
areas<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.219> nice<00:00:38.879> rich<00:00:39.149> darks<00:00:39.539> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
areas you can see nice rich darks that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.970 
areas you can see nice rich darks that
were<00:00:40.230> created<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.190> quickly<00:00:41.600> while<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
were created very quickly while the

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.770 
were created very quickly while the
mid-tones<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.370> took<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.359> more<00:00:45.539> time

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
mid-tones I took a little bit more time

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.439 
mid-tones I took a little bit more time
to<00:00:45.960> create<00:00:46.199> using<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.800> lot<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> transparent

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
to create using a lot of transparent

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.430 
to create using a lot of transparent
pigments<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.559> also<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:51.210> able<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> create<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
pigments I also was able to create the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.430 
pigments I also was able to create the
illusion<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.980> form<00:00:53.539> through<00:00:54.539> using<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:55.050> value

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
illusion of form through using a value

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
illusion of form through using a value
map<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.890> value<00:00:56.190> shapes<00:00:56.489> I'll<00:00:57.329> take<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
map or value shapes I'll take you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.419 
map or value shapes I'll take you
through<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:58.109> steps<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.739> create<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> piece

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
through these steps to create a piece

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:08.300 
through these steps to create a piece
like<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.940> whatever<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.750> subject

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.070 

next<00:01:09.000> layer<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> middle<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.659> red<00:01:11.930> see<00:01:12.930> how

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
next layer in the middle is red see how

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.140 
next layer in the middle is red see how
the<00:01:13.140> blue<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> dominant<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.190> over<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:14.970> we

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the blue is dominant now over here we

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480 
the blue is dominant now over here we
have<00:01:15.270> blue<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:16.440> soon<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.860> put<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> red<00:01:17.310> on

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
have blue as soon as I put the red on

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
have blue as soon as I put the red on
see<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.000> dominates<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.259> becomes

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
see how that dominates it it now becomes

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:31.010 
see how that dominates it it now becomes
more<00:01:20.369> important

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:02:01.780 

and<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> last<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.490> yellow

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.520 

okay<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:02.390> we've<00:02:02.660> got<00:02:02.840> three<00:02:03.290> different

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
okay so we've got three different

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.530 
okay so we've got three different
results<00:02:04.370> I<00:02:04.460> think<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.790> can<00:02:04.970> see<00:02:05.180> how<00:02:05.210> this

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
results I think you can see how this

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.650 
results I think you can see how this
Square<00:02:06.500> has<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> more<00:02:07.100> yellow<00:02:07.340> feel<00:02:07.730> more<00:02:08.420> red

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
Square has a more yellow feel more red

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.540 
Square has a more yellow feel more red
feel<00:02:08.930> more<00:02:09.170> blue<00:02:09.380> feel<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.860> that's<00:02:10.010> because

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
feel more blue feel and that's because

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.970 
feel more blue feel and that's because
that<00:02:11.150> was<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.510> last<00:02:11.720> piece<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.770> last

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
that was the last piece that the last

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.130 
that was the last piece that the last
layer<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.520> last<00:02:13.700> color<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.120> went<00:02:14.240> down

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.950 

your<00:02:21.710> first<00:02:21.980> layer<00:02:22.280> could<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.480> wanted<00:02:23.810> it

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
your first layer could if you wanted it

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.280 
your first layer could if you wanted it
to<00:02:23.990> be<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.470> could<00:02:24.680> be<00:02:24.830> two<00:02:25.160> colors<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:25.819> this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
to be it could be two colors like this

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.840 
to be it could be two colors like this
if<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.530> wanted<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.040> kind<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.459> have<00:02:28.640> things

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
if you wanted to kind of have things

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.120 
if you wanted to kind of have things
gray<00:02:29.180> dated<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:29.870> bit<00:02:30.020> or<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.770> can<00:02:30.950> just

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
gray dated a little bit or you can just

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.010 
gray dated a little bit or you can just
stick<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.459> one<00:02:31.640> color<00:02:31.910> at<00:02:32.120> first<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.870> get

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
stick to one color at first just to get

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.370 
stick to one color at first just to get
the<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.560> feeling<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.069> idea<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:36.080> first

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
the the feeling the idea of it the first

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.100 
the the feeling the idea of it the first
layer<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.709> one<00:02:37.630> continuous<00:02:38.630> value<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:41.110> what

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
layer is one continuous value and what

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.600 
layer is one continuous value and what
I'm<00:02:42.230> going<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:42.709> now<00:02:42.890> with<00:02:43.070> my<00:02:43.190> brush<00:02:43.430> is

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
I'm going to do now with my brush is

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.790 
I'm going to do now with my brush is
start<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.970> lift<00:02:44.180> up<00:02:44.360> all<00:02:44.570> my<00:02:44.780> lights<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.709> I've

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
start to lift up all my lights so I've

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.979 
start to lift up all my lights so I've
got<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:48.980> nice<00:02:49.160> big<00:02:49.430> light<00:02:49.670> right<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:49.970> here<00:02:50.420> see

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
got a nice big light right in here see

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.870 
got a nice big light right in here see
how<00:02:51.140> this<00:02:51.290> nice<00:02:51.530> clean<00:02:51.830> ski<00:02:52.130> sable<00:02:52.550> when<00:02:52.730> it's

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
how this nice clean ski sable when it's

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:11.430 
how this nice clean ski sable when it's
thirsty<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.720> picks<00:02:54.080> up<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.739> paint

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.710 

I'm<00:03:11.980> going<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.190> use<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> smaller<00:03:12.670> brush<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.600> get

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
I'm going to use a smaller brush to get

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.770 
I'm going to use a smaller brush to get
into<00:03:13.780> some<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.320> these<00:03:14.440> smaller<00:03:14.770> shapes<00:03:15.780> for

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
into some of these smaller shapes for

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.510 
into some of these smaller shapes for
example<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.500> little<00:03:18.250> stalk<00:03:18.850> here<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:21.340> want

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
example this little stalk here just want

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.130 
example this little stalk here just want
that<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.850> be<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> little<00:03:22.300> lighter<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.900> side

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
that to be a little lighter on this side

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:35.470 
that to be a little lighter on this side
I<00:03:23.170> can<00:03:23.470> always<00:03:23.620> put<00:03:23.890> more<00:03:24.040> paint<00:03:24.280> back<00:03:24.460> on<00:03:24.760> it

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.170 

and<00:03:36.480> maybe<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:36.840> for<00:03:37.409> fun<00:03:37.590> I'll<00:03:37.769> put<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.310> layer

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
and maybe just for fun I'll put a layer

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.050 
and maybe just for fun I'll put a layer
of<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:40.500> Quinn<00:03:40.739> coral<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.220> background<00:03:41.790> I

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
of the Quinn coral in the background I

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.970 
of the Quinn coral in the background I
don't<00:03:42.299> want<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.569> get<00:03:42.690> too<00:03:42.930> dark<00:03:43.560> because<00:03:43.799> I

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
don't want to get too dark because I

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.759 
don't want to get too dark because I
want<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.340> have<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.580> ability<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:46.739> know

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
want to have the ability to you know

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.330 
want to have the ability to you know
spread<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.670> paint<00:03:48.269> around<00:03:48.629> and<00:03:49.310> get<00:03:50.310> some

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
spread the paint around and get some

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.970 
spread the paint around and get some
lights<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.970> middles<00:03:51.299> happening<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
lights and middles happening in in a

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.869 
lights and middles happening in in a
nice<00:03:53.159> luminous<00:03:53.640> background<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.569> think

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
nice luminous background but I think

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.220 
nice luminous background but I think
just<00:03:56.879> for<00:03:57.120> for<00:03:57.629> balancing<00:03:58.079> out<00:03:58.200> my

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
just for for balancing out my

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.899 
just for for balancing out my
composition<00:03:58.980> right<00:03:59.099> now<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.430> maybe<00:03:59.610> putting

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
composition right now and maybe putting

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.770 
composition right now and maybe putting
some<00:04:00.030> nice<00:04:00.390> layers<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:01.079> on<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.940> stem<00:04:03.299> it

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
some nice layers in on this stem it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.319 
some nice layers in on this stem it
might<00:04:03.989> be<00:04:04.110> kind<00:04:04.319> of<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.470> good<00:04:04.620> idea<00:04:05.010> I'll<00:04:06.000> paint

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
might be kind of a good idea I'll paint

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:25.800 
might be kind of a good idea I'll paint
around<00:04:06.629> a<00:04:06.810> few<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.049> these<00:04:07.170> shapes<00:04:07.530> too

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.950 

sometimes<00:04:26.650> it's<00:04:26.830> nice<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.340> go<00:04:27.490> over<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.690> lines

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
sometimes it's nice to go over the lines

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.290 
sometimes it's nice to go over the lines
you<00:04:29.470> know<00:04:29.620> we're<00:04:29.920> always<00:04:30.100> told<00:04:30.370> stay<00:04:30.970> inside

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
you know we're always told stay inside

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.540 
you know we're always told stay inside
or<00:04:31.510> outside<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.900> lines<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.470> sometimes<00:04:33.340> it's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
or outside the lines and sometimes it's

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.340 
or outside the lines and sometimes it's
nice<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.790> go<00:04:34.120> over<00:04:34.330> top<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.750> these<00:04:34.870> things<00:04:35.230> a

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
nice to go over top of these things a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:49.830 
nice to go over top of these things a
little<00:04:35.470> bit<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:35.860> it's<00:04:36.010> not<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.190> perfect

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.200 

getting<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.620> real<00:04:50.800> dry<00:04:51.220> brush<00:04:51.490> mark<00:04:51.790> here<00:04:52.060> and

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
getting a real dry brush mark here and

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.900 
getting a real dry brush mark here and
if<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:52.780> were<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.020> touch<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:54.070> paper<00:04:54.430> before<00:04:54.880> I

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
if you were to touch that paper before I

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.190 
if you were to touch that paper before I
just<00:04:55.150> put<00:04:55.300> this<00:04:55.420> layer<00:04:55.690> down<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.050> would<00:04:56.170> be

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
just put this layer down it would be

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.930 
just put this layer down it would be
very<00:04:56.470> cold<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.010> touch<00:04:57.130> it's<00:04:57.550> still<00:04:57.760> very

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
very cold to the touch it's still very

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.800 
very cold to the touch it's still very
damp<00:04:59.639> I'm<00:05:00.639> just<00:05:00.850> going<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.060> soften<00:05:01.300> up<00:05:01.540> some<00:05:01.570> of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
damp I'm just going to soften up some of

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.140 
damp I'm just going to soften up some of
these<00:05:01.930> edges<00:05:02.260> up<00:05:02.830> here<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:03.190> hard<00:05:03.550> edges<00:05:03.820> draw

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
these edges up here so hard edges draw

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.650 
these edges up here so hard edges draw
your<00:05:04.360> eye<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:06.160> if<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.610> soften<00:05:07.150> them<00:05:07.270> up<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.510> little

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
your eye so if I soften them up a little

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.230 
your eye so if I soften them up a little
bit<00:05:07.900> we'll<00:05:08.650> have<00:05:08.889> a<00:05:09.190> little<00:05:09.820> bit<00:05:09.910> different

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
bit we'll have a little bit different

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.070 
bit we'll have a little bit different
shape<00:05:10.270> going<00:05:10.750> on<00:05:10.870> here<00:05:11.139> but<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.860> won't<00:05:12.100> be

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
shape going on here but it won't be

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:23.620 
shape going on here but it won't be
dominant

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.689 

okay<00:05:24.630> let's<00:05:24.840> try<00:05:25.020> some<00:05:25.320> blue<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:27.320> usually<00:05:28.320> use

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
okay let's try some blue I usually use

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.670 
okay let's try some blue I usually use
more<00:05:29.699> sedimentary<00:05:30.330> or<00:05:30.510> opaque<00:05:31.080> colors<00:05:31.470> right

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
more sedimentary or opaque colors right

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.300 
more sedimentary or opaque colors right
at<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:31.919> end

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
at the end

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.189 
at the end
now<00:05:32.430> I'm<00:05:32.729> not<00:05:32.880> I'm<00:05:33.210> hoping<00:05:33.690> I<00:05:33.840> won't<00:05:34.050> go<00:05:34.169> back

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
now I'm not I'm hoping I won't go back

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.170 
now I'm not I'm hoping I won't go back
into<00:05:34.800> this<00:05:36.199> this<00:05:37.199> dark<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:37.979> doesn't<00:05:38.180> usually

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
into this this dark it doesn't usually

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.030 
into this this dark it doesn't usually
turn<00:05:39.419> out<00:05:39.570> too<00:05:39.780> well<00:05:39.810> if<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.199> do<00:05:40.350> I<00:05:40.410> need<00:05:40.710> to<00:05:40.860> do

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
turn out too well if you do I need to do

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.820 
turn out too well if you do I need to do
it<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.520> leave<00:05:41.970> it<00:05:42.050> so<00:05:43.050> I'm<00:05:43.110> going<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.350> use<00:05:43.590> a

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
it and leave it so I'm going to use a

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.460 
it and leave it so I'm going to use a
few<00:05:44.210> sedimentary<00:05:45.210> colors<00:05:45.900> I<00:05:46.080> put<00:05:46.350> a<00:05:46.380> little

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
few sedimentary colors I put a little

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.900 
few sedimentary colors I put a little
bit<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.710> cerulean<00:05:46.979> in<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.460> little<00:05:47.729> bit<00:05:47.820> of

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
bit of cerulean in a little bit of

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.930 
bit of cerulean in a little bit of
ultramarine<00:05:48.030> blue<00:05:49.370> just<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.490> give<00:05:50.669> it<00:05:50.699> a<00:05:50.820> bit

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
ultramarine blue just to give it a bit

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.700 
ultramarine blue just to give it a bit
of<00:05:50.970> grittiness<00:05:51.360> because<00:05:51.960> of<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.440> nice

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
of grittiness because of that nice

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.920 
of grittiness because of that nice
sediment<00:05:53.490> that<00:05:53.850> happens<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.389> then<00:05:54.479> I<00:05:54.570> got<00:05:54.750> my

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
sediment that happens and then I got my

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.770 
sediment that happens and then I got my
I<00:05:54.960> have<00:05:55.260> my<00:05:55.289> Windsor<00:05:55.830> Newton<00:05:56.389> here<00:05:57.389> as<00:05:57.570> well

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
I have my Windsor Newton here as well

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.080 
I have my Windsor Newton here as well

know we could probably get away with

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:22.499 
know we could probably get away with
punching<00:07:17.380> up<00:07:17.530> some<00:07:17.800> of<00:07:17.919> the<00:07:17.979> red<00:07:21.509> perhaps
