00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
a large map so that should be awesome I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
a large map so that should be awesome I
have<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.539> opinions<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.230> large<00:00:58.710> maps<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.129> do

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
have my opinions on large maps I do

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
have my opinions on large maps I do
actually<00:00:59.460> prefer<00:01:00.030> smaller<00:01:00.480> maps<00:01:00.750> port<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
actually prefer smaller maps port a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
actually prefer smaller maps port a
large<00:01:01.710> maps<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.160> work<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.579> they're<00:01:02.730> done

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
large maps can work if they're done

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
large maps can work if they're done
actually<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.470> should<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.680> awesome

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
actually right so that should be awesome

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
actually right so that should be awesome
as<00:01:05.250> well<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> hopefully<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.420> an

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
as well and hopefully it's an

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.050 
as well and hopefully it's an
interactive<00:01:06.960> map<00:01:07.380> lap<00:01:07.680> we've<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> cliff

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
interactive map lap we've got in a cliff

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.730 
interactive map lap we've got in a cliff
to<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:09.390> still<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> few<00:01:10.049> interactive<00:01:10.530> maps

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to go still have a few interactive maps

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.289 
to go still have a few interactive maps
but<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.790> them<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.090> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
but we know that not all of them are so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.030 
but we know that not all of them are so
hopefully<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> interactive

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
hopefully this one will be interactive

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
hopefully this one will be interactive
in<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.939> ways<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.360> moving<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
in some ways so moving on to the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
in some ways so moving on to the
campaign<00:01:16.710> side<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.369> eurogamer<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.119> also

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
campaign side so at eurogamer we also

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
campaign side so at eurogamer we also
got<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> better<00:01:18.900> look<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> mission<00:01:20.009> called
