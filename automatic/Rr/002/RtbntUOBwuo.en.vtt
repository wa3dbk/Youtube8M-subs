00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
let's see there's the TV input now I

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.580 
let's see there's the TV input now I
don't<00:02:12.860> have<00:02:13.070> an<00:02:13.190> antenna<00:02:13.490> hooked<00:02:13.760> up<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.060> this

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
don't have an antenna hooked up to this

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.050 
don't have an antenna hooked up to this
all's<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.740> has<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.220> back<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.610> an<00:02:16.700> antenna

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
all's it has on the back is an antenna

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.480 
all's it has on the back is an antenna
hookup<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.480> would<00:02:17.810> need<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.490> digital

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
hookup you would need a digital

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.680 
hookup you would need a digital
converter<00:02:20.270> since<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.140> all<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.590> TV<00:02:21.950> is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
converter since now all the TV is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.940 
converter since now all the TV is
over-the-air<00:02:23.690> TV<00:02:24.170> anyway<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.800> via<00:02:25.310> digital

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
over-the-air TV anyway is via digital

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
over-the-air TV anyway is via digital
styles<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:29.150> then<00:02:29.270> we'll<00:02:29.390> go<00:02:29.510> ahead<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.970> eject

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
styles so then we'll go ahead and eject

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.000 
styles so then we'll go ahead and eject
the<00:02:32.480> tape<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.050> can<00:02:33.200> see<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.500> work<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.980> I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.800 
the tape so you can see that work and I
don't<00:02:34.070> think<00:02:34.340> there's<00:02:34.670> an<00:02:34.790> eject<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
don't think there's an eject on the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.600
