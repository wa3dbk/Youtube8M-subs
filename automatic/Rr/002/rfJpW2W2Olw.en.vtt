and decided that it costs America
Americans<00:00:58.320> specifically<00:00:59.120> 1.7<00:01:00.120> billion

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

dollars a year in unproductivity what we

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.880 
dollars a year in unproductivity what we
learned

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
learned

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
learned
