00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
puck what the no articulation but

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.200 
puck what the no articulation but
he's<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:06.010> guess<00:05:06.400> he's<00:05:06.550> supposed<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:06.820> be<00:05:06.970> able<00:05:07.060> to

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
he's I guess he's supposed to be able to

do the handstand right with that hand

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.970 
do the handstand right with that hand
and<00:05:10.360> maybe<00:05:10.900> that's<00:05:11.110> why<00:05:11.350> they<00:05:11.380> gave<00:05:11.620> them<00:05:11.860> on

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
and maybe that's why they gave them on

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.040 
and maybe that's why they gave them on
no<00:05:12.550> joints<00:05:13.030> right<00:05:13.240> in<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.480> knees<00:05:13.660> or<00:05:13.870> elbows
