00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.810 

starting<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.830> motorcycle<00:01:15.370> early<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:15.730> the

morning so I had to give about 15 to 20
kicks<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.210> problem<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.840> gone<00:01:23.200> or<00:01:23.410> even

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
kicks but that problem is gone or even

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.710 
kicks but that problem is gone or even
even<00:01:23.860> after<00:01:24.340> using<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.790> choke<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.210> had<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.540> give

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
even after using the choke I had to give

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.180 
even after using the choke I had to give
about<00:01:26.050> 15-20<00:01:26.800> kick<00:01:27.240> 15:28<00:01:28.240> kicks<00:01:28.510> so<00:01:29.260> but<00:01:30.040> now

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
about 15-20 kick 15:28 kicks so but now

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.580 
about 15-20 kick 15:28 kicks so but now
that<00:01:30.430> problem<00:01:30.760> is<00:01:30.880> gone<00:01:31.150> now<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:32.380> one<00:01:32.560> or

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
that problem is gone now in just one or

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.380 
that problem is gone now in just one or
two<00:01:32.710> kicks<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.960> gets<00:01:35.440> on<00:01:35.620> and<00:01:35.860> I<00:01:36.190> think<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
two kicks it gets on and I think it the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.560 
two kicks it gets on and I think it the
engine<00:01:37.600> takes<00:01:37.870> time<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.560> stabilize<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:40.420> is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
engine takes time to stabilize that is

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.000 
engine takes time to stabilize that is
that<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.930> one<00:01:41.110> thing<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.350> second<00:01:41.650> thing<00:01:41.800> now

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
that is one thing and second thing now

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.410 
that is one thing and second thing now
