do<00:02:24.330> whatever<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.840> want<00:02:25.260> um<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:27.270> easiest<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
do whatever you want um it's easiest to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.480 
do whatever you want um it's easiest to
just<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.290> your<00:02:28.410> legs<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:29.340> you're

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
starting because it's I guess just the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.520 
starting because it's I guess just the
easiest<00:02:32.940> way<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> hold<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.870> when<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> get

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
easiest way to hold it and when you get

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.470 
easiest way to hold it and when you get
more<00:02:34.740> advanced<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.490> build<00:02:35.880> up<00:02:36.030> more<00:02:36.270> AB

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
more advanced and you build up more AB

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.200 
more advanced and you build up more AB
