00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
pace this car could be absolutely

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.719 
pace this car could be absolutely
monstrous<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.070> he<00:01:17.280> had<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.580> good

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
monstrous and I he had a really good

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.010 
monstrous and I he had a really good
season<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.030> Chelsea<00:01:18.420> last<00:01:18.600> season<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.930> know

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
season for Chelsea last season you know

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.289 
season for Chelsea last season you know
he<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.350> banging<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.250> gold<00:01:20.460> slip<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
he was banging a lot of gold slip so I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
he was banging a lot of gold slip so I
think<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.689> does<00:01:21.869> deserve<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.770> upgrade<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
think it does deserve the upgrade and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.890 
think it does deserve the upgrade and

incredible<00:01:50.100> I've<00:01:50.250> giving<00:01:50.490> them<00:01:50.610> Plus<00:01:50.820> free

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
incredible I've giving them Plus free

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
incredible I've giving them Plus free
first<00:01:51.329> cool<00:01:51.540> because<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.780> feel<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.170> 70<00:01:52.799> at

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
first cool because I feel like 70 at

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.469 
first cool because I feel like 70 at
first<00:01:53.100> school<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> know<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.970> feel<00:01:54.390> like

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
first school you know like I feel like

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.760 
first school you know like I feel like
he's<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:54.990> bigger<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.409> lot<00:01:55.530> stronger

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
he's a lot bigger and a lot stronger

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.530 
he's a lot bigger and a lot stronger
then<00:01:56.070> he's<00:01:56.250> very<00:01:56.520> good<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> air<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.360> well

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
then he's very good in the air as well

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.209 
then he's very good in the air as well
so<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.110> seventy-eights<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:59.130> bit

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
so I think seventy-eights a little bit

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.160 
so I think seventy-eights a little bit
low<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.909> plus<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.390> shooting<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:00.930> this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
low also plus to shooting because this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.410 
low also plus to shooting because this
finishing<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.619> absolutely<00:02:02.310> class<00:02:02.729> plus<00:02:03.210> one

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
finishing is absolutely class plus one

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
finishing is absolutely class plus one

Ibrahimovic and in fifa15 he has a 90 ID
card<00:02:28.629> i'm<00:02:28.810> gonna<00:02:29.080> guess<00:02:29.349> he's<00:02:29.500> gonna<00:02:29.650> get<00:02:29.830> a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
card i'm gonna guess he's gonna get a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.860 
card i'm gonna guess he's gonna get a
downgrade<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:31.290> 12<00:02:32.290> at<00:02:32.560> FIFA<00:02:33.220> 16<00:02:33.640> uh<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.750> know

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
downgrade of 12 at FIFA 16 uh you know

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.280 
downgrade of 12 at FIFA 16 uh you know
89<00:02:35.470> rated<00:02:36.069> card<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.549> as<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.910> see<00:02:37.120> there<00:02:37.390> it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
89 rated card and as can see there it's

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.809 
89 rated card and as can see there it's
of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.709> reasoning<00:02:39.069> for<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.489> because<00:02:39.790> you

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
of the reasoning for it is because you

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.819 
of the reasoning for it is because you
getting<00:02:40.090> older<00:02:40.390> EA<00:02:40.629> love<00:02:40.959> decreasing<00:02:41.500> older

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
getting older EA love decreasing older

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.800 
getting older EA love decreasing older
players<00:02:42.129> so<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.849> just<00:02:43.060> makes<00:02:43.209> sense<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.750> guess

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
players so it just makes sense I guess

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.569 
players so it just makes sense I guess
but<00:02:44.349> are<00:02:44.500> looking<00:02:44.920> at<00:02:45.099> some<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.459> these

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
but are looking at some of these

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.660 
but are looking at some of these
concepts<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:46.660> you've<00:02:46.840> got<00:02:46.989> 875<00:02:47.890> pace<00:02:48.310> 19

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
concepts now you've got 875 pace 19

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.670 
concepts now you've got 875 pace 19
shooting<00:02:48.790> 82<00:02:49.299> passing<00:02:49.750> 85<00:02:50.170> drawing<00:02:50.440> at<00:02:50.590> a

shooting 82 passing 85 drawing at a
6-foot<00:02:51.280> school<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.090> got<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> minus<00:02:52.690> 1

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
6-foot school so it's got a minus 1

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.539 
6-foot school so it's got a minus 1

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
shooting I don't know why says plus one

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.420 
shooting I don't know why says plus one
little<00:02:54.790> error<00:02:55.030> i<00:02:55.150> guess-<00:02:56.109> one<00:02:56.500> pace<00:02:56.829> as<00:02:57.069> well

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
little error i guess- one pace as well

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.550 
little error i guess- one pace as well
however<00:02:57.640> i<00:02:58.000> think<00:02:58.030> his<00:02:58.750> fiscal<00:02:59.019> will<00:02:59.319> say<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
however i think his fiscal will say the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.280 
however i think his fiscal will say the
same<00:02:59.620> his<00:02:59.890> passing<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.400> him<00:03:00.519> go<00:03:00.760> up<00:03:01.000> by<00:03:01.540> one<00:03:01.870> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
same his passing to him go up by one and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.009 
same his passing to him go up by one and
