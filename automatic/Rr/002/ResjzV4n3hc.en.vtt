00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
all the same car but transformed into

all the same car but transformed into
different<00:00:35.270> things<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:38.280> obvious<00:00:38.610> they

to me the barricade is he's accurate to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.000 
to me the barricade is he's accurate to
what<00:00:54.030> he<00:00:54.120> looked<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> game<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.350> mean

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
what he looked like on the game I mean

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
what he looked like on the game I mean
like<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:57.059> vehicle<00:00:57.480> mode<00:00:57.629> wise<00:00:57.870> anyways<00:00:58.379> in

the<00:00:58.980> darkened<00:00:59.370> moon<00:00:59.520> game<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.940> called<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.620> for

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the darkened moon game is called and for

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.539 
the darkened moon game is called and for
sir<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.070> think<00:01:02.539> but<00:01:03.860> not<00:01:04.860> new<00:01:05.070> potential<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
sir I think but not new potential I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.090 
sir I think but not new potential I
don't<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> game<00:01:06.270> I've<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.659> seen

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
don't have the game I've just seen

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.060 
don't have the game I've just seen
YouTube<00:01:08.100> gameplay<00:01:08.640> videos<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.619> he's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> front

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
YouTube gameplay videos but he's a front

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.060 
YouTube gameplay videos but he's a front
look<00:01:11.840> each<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.140> these<00:01:14.180> side<00:01:15.180> mirrors<00:01:16.070> of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
look each of these side mirrors of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
look each of these side mirrors of
different<00:01:17.430> colors<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.750> guessing<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.290> he's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
different colors so I'm guessing if he's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.160 
different colors so I'm guessing if he's
driving<00:01:19.950> lon<00:01:20.130> these<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.820> flash<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.570> he's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
driving lon these would flash and he's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.530 
driving lon these would flash and he's
got<00:01:22.380> nice<00:01:23.659> big<00:01:24.659> said<00:01:25.140> decepticon<00:01:26.070> logo<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
got nice big said decepticon logo on the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.530 
got nice big said decepticon logo on the
side<00:01:27.840> he<00:01:28.710> does<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.100> quite<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> panel

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
side he does have quite a lot of panel

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.560 
side he does have quite a lot of panel
lines<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.200> ball<00:01:32.159> joints<00:01:32.520> exposed<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.360> both

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
lines and ball joints exposed on both

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.620 
lines and ball joints exposed on both
sides<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.470> okay<00:01:35.420> paint<00:01:36.420> pretty

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
sides but that's okay paint pretty

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.880 
sides but that's okay paint pretty
decent<00:01:37.759> silver<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:40.470> best<00:01:40.680> about

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
decent silver here it's the best about

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
decent silver here it's the best about
it<00:01:41.189> there's<00:01:41.909> nothing<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.360> showing<00:01:43.140> from

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it there's nothing really showing from

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.789 
it there's nothing really showing from
underneath<00:01:43.790> however<00:01:44.790> there's<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.210> problem

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
underneath however there's one problem

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.080 
underneath however there's one problem
mine<00:01:46.799> doesn't<00:01:47.430> roll<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:49.399> these<00:01:50.399> two<00:01:50.790> rear

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
mine doesn't roll it's these two rear

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.389 
mine doesn't roll it's these two rear
wheels<00:01:51.450> don't<00:01:51.960> roll<00:01:52.939> they<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.180> stay<00:01:54.509> there

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
wheels don't roll they just stay there

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.120 
wheels don't roll they just stay there
now<00:01:56.399> let's<00:01:56.729> get<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.780> our<00:01:57.990> size<00:01:58.409> comparison

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
now let's get on to our size comparison

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.530 
now let's get on to our size comparison
use<00:01:59.909> went<00:02:00.270> dark<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.780> Moon<00:02:01.020> topspin<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.540> dark

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
use went dark and Moon topspin and dark

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.050 
use went dark and Moon topspin and dark
of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.719> moon<00:02:04.009> sideswipe<00:02:05.009> these<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.549> Legion

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
of the moon sideswipe these all Legion

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.880 
of the moon sideswipe these all Legion
classes<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:09.920> but

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
classes so you can see but

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.330 
classes so you can see but
crowbar<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.160> quite<00:02:13.790> small<00:02:15.070> compared<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.190> them

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
crowbar is quite small compared to them

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.260 
crowbar is quite small compared to them
and<00:02:16.640> quite<00:02:17.120> thin<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.810> well<00:02:18.020> i<00:02:18.860> guess<00:02:19.310> but

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and quite thin as well i guess but

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.000 
and quite thin as well i guess but
accurate<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.930> what<00:02:21.050> he's<00:02:21.170> like<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.680> movie

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
accurate to what he's like in the movie

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.880 
accurate to what he's like in the movie
because<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> movie<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.820> quite<00:02:23.090> sneak<00:02:23.890> but

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
because in the movie is quite sneak but

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.340 
because in the movie is quite sneak but
yeah<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.640> let's<00:02:25.820> go<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.270> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
yeah so let's go on to the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.780 
yeah so let's go on to the
transformation<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:30.230> we<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.860> crowbar

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
transformation and here we have crowbar

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.540 
transformation and here we have crowbar
in<00:02:32.000> his<00:02:32.270> robot<00:02:32.690> mode<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.770> superb

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
in his robot mode this is a superb

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.590 
in his robot mode this is a superb
superb<00:02:34.880> via<00:02:35.660> robot<00:02:36.260> mode<00:02:36.470> i<00:02:36.680> mean<00:02:37.210> i'm<00:02:38.210> very

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
superb via robot mode i mean i'm very
