this case optical Center serves as the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
this case optical Center serves as the

the right side is positive similarly

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.620 
the right side is positive similarly
when<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.040> talk<00:01:11.070> about<00:01:11.280> image<00:01:11.939> distance<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
when we talk about image distance that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.539 
when we talk about image distance that
also<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> left<00:01:13.470> side<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> negative<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.430> on

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
also on the left side is negative and on

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.480 
also on the left side is negative and on

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
in mind let us try to look at the lens

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.490 
in mind let us try to look at the lens

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
lenses so what is the mirror what is the
lens<00:01:55.380> formula<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.520> very<00:01:56.759> similar<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
lens formula it is very similar to the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.389 
lens formula it is very similar to the
method<00:01:57.689> equation<00:01:58.200> except<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.250> negative

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
method equation except with a negative

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.060 
method equation except with a negative
sign<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.299> 1<00:02:00.540> by<00:02:00.570> V<00:02:01.079> minus<00:02:01.350> 1<00:02:02.040> by<00:02:02.250> U

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
sign it is 1 by V minus 1 by U

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.990 
sign it is 1 by V minus 1 by U
321<00:02:03.730> by<00:02:03.940> F<00:02:04.180> where<00:02:04.840> V<00:02:05.440> is<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.680> image<00:02:06.159> distance<00:02:06.460> U

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
321 by F where V is the image distance U

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.180 
321 by F where V is the image distance U
is<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.360> object<00:02:07.540> distance<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.440> F<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:09.039> the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
is the object distance and F is the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.310 
is the object distance and F is the
focal<00:02:09.340> length<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.420> lens<00:02:10.630> formula<00:02:11.050> is

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
focal length so this lens formula is

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.710 
focal length so this lens formula is
true<00:02:11.620> for<00:02:11.890> both<00:02:11.950> concave<00:02:12.670> lenses<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.270> convex

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
true for both concave lenses and convex

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.750 
true for both concave lenses and convex
lenses<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.830> need<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.310> take<00:02:15.520> into

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
lenses but you need to take into

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.060 
lenses but you need to take into
consideration<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.630> sign<00:02:16.840> convention<00:02:17.590> when

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
consideration the sign convention when

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.590 
consideration the sign convention when
which<00:02:18.250> when<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.700> try<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.030> solve<00:02:19.360> problems
