00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.060
 okay 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.060
 we will be able to start playing 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.980
 At the beginning 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.919
 it seems to me enough 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:09.890
 useful 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.890
 to respect some technical points 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.669
 to the extent that he has lived great moments adapted from the game we will put in 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.669
 place from the beginning it's this embarrassment afterwards 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.769
 and in this case it may not be very obvious especially 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.619
 because some hens 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.689
 will not be natural 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.980
 in europe as obvious as that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.540
 already with regard to the memory and the feather of the pick 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.900
 I started playing that way 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.460
 at the same date will not be like that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.800
 which seemed to me the most natural 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.500
 and futures 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.710
 it was not necessarily so because it 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.550
 already adopted thereafter 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.000
 this is the moment it is maintained 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.020
 samaras 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
 yum thanks to the inside she is more efficient 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.910
 payment of the order 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.129
 here is the same investment bank that three 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.700
 we set aside on the side 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 and he will end up 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.590
 this location 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.590
 after each meal prepared to feel good 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.210
 and then why the following departments according to the rates he said 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.790
 by then since Saturday morning 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.300
 this time per day and allowed me to have more than 800 meals 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.520
 President 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.450
 the second would carry a ball in the right leg is the party 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.240
 beat apple 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.950
 barack obama 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 it'll come back to crack you know 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.390
 that's the debt 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 he's not late by dublin brings him 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.970
 not easy with the page 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.140
 on the reverse 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.100
 vincent maraval far ahead 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.430
 see 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.820
 in the Gaza strip he was several centuries old 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.250
 Last year 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.299
 this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.299
 from then on down 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.099
 more than the year before my poetry and prose antilles 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 with this placement of the pick 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.239
 from the place of the left pointon 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.299
 it is very simple 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.679
 we only have to 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.359
 the standard positioning will try to distribute them on rtl 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.799
 so here I'm not going 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.309
 of the first caravan 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.629
 I will put the first must work kazatchkine 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.060
 for the unemployed at the end of rights must stop at three and I do not want 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.350
 act as if I had played 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.350
 our shop 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.349
 here it goes directly to the places to look for 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.390
 so why this haste to see how important is the first 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.419
 service 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.789
 I think he will soon discover a year 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.639
 so here we have to wait ten years that way 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.379
 while the canopy 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.850
 the defendant Sunday 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.139
 a small wind of madness killed because it takes 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.080
 that's what allows him to open the death penalty 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.080
 for the distribution of water 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.309
 simply these games 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.959
 the second period 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.539
 no one should doubt 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
 vaz could play with 3 4% and 7% 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.059
 the job I play with fear 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.669
 I have trouble 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.100
 that's where for that internship 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.659
 a rumor 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.749
 ok after the banks 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.199
 in passing 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.189
 we have better support behind the bar 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.429
 here for the department the good gestures for mobile is very good 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.769
 and then play with your fingers 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.619
 simply have a better touch 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.619
 then by the utmost firmness these fights 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.589
 it's with the fingertip like their elders in the dough flat here we 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:05.299
 not drink should hardly 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.779
 we will have trouble 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.889
 at the party for ford produced 4 child by the hand will not come to work on 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.949
 the on the effects of peaceful way 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.379
 okay 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.829
 to sum up 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.019
 2008 record to watch anyway play because simply 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.819
 that's where he wants to get in through 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.610
 departure 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.570
 if you approach this way the direction Liège and bouchut 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.800
 on the heels of time 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.900
 this wild country safra the conjuncture 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.930
 but should not be too surprised by the general 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.199
 in order to always always keep 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.669
 the grave on board landed on 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.669
 rogge 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:51.270
 the body of laëtitia perrais in some cases where in addition to doing 

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:52.169
 speak 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.919
 from his native village 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.759
 the village of the goal line 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.879
 so as not to bother to key a budget that do not want to tell each other 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:02.909
 side the bodies 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.409
 and for that we did not expect a priori so I hope square departure 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.349
 it's better where he is 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.349
 to apply this polytechnic team 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.689
 as ump deputies 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.879
 what am I going to do here I'm going to finger up 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.169
 for sale at 3 9 m 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.080
 and they will not move panama 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.389
 cycle 3 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.249
 we owe him a problem of order 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.279
 and from there I could have found the little finger 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.939
 woerth 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.939
 google org - Pope Benedict xvi appeared important 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.309
 a few days later 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.309
 so here weights the police loop 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.930
 the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.169
 the 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.370
 the 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.860
 field 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.879
 these are the forces controlled by the seybouse 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.319
 embarrassed by laurent fignon's behavior since two deans did 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.319
 plus time to raise arms on the island 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.110
 higher ok 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.460
 it's not the death penalty 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.409
 this selection in history 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.650
 same topo 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.569
 bottom right 2 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.479
 capra 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.719
 and we must rejoice boulerice 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.610
 addressing the first must play on box 2 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.339
 and then 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.139
 on Saturday the first one has to go back to playing lagarde opponent spreading so 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.669
 blame tadoussac with the little finger 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.629
 that's all it's done on a position 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.530
 the first must be used at 23h 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.480
 even the guy does not move it is especially that which is important it allows 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.069
 to people to work on opening the water 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.119
 my state of fatigue behind we did not exist to displease me 

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:47.380
 it's a little bit bad 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.270
 you can drop your data 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.270
 for the moment 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.550
 the cope 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.550
 proof 2 everyone 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.569
 club 2 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.079
 coc 2 11 in the eleven thousand 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.969
 it seems difficult to me the highest of all peoples in danger 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.539
 the other 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:19.919
 relative 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.949
 the Parisian leader was filed 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:25.990
 billevesées of opposite municipalities 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.949
 OK good luck
