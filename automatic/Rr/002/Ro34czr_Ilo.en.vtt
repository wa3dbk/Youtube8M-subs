about this for the work that I've been

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.130 
about this for the work that I've been
doing<00:00:16.680> lately<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.490> trees<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.270> being<00:00:18.869> able<00:00:18.990> to

rig<00:00:19.830> out<00:00:20.010> multiple<00:00:20.609> stems<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.470> time<00:00:22.830> not

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
rig out multiple stems at one time not

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.140 
rig out multiple stems at one time not
having<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.180> lower<00:00:24.390> down<00:00:24.769> one<00:00:25.769> at<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.220> just

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
having to lower down one at a time just

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.500 
having to lower down one at a time just
using<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> regular<00:00:28.490> lowering<00:00:29.490> line<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.970> can

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
using the regular lowering line I can

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.939 
using the regular lowering line I can
attach<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.289> lowering<00:00:31.590> line<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.920> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
attach to the lowering line that I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.479 
attach to the lowering line that I
normally<00:00:32.040> would<00:00:32.520> use<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.329> attach<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.680> one

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
normally would use to attach to one one

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.860 
normally would use to attach to one one
stem<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.190> attach<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
stem and I can just attach that right to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.860 
stem and I can just attach that right to
the<00:00:39.989> reading<00:00:40.230> cube<00:00:40.440> itself<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.190> UFL<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.969> then

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the reading cube itself the UFL and then

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.340 
the reading cube itself the UFL and then
attach<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> UFO<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:45.030> multi<00:00:45.450> spider<00:00:46.110> legs

attach to the UFO have multi spider legs

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.869 
attach to the UFO have multi spider legs
coming<00:00:46.649> off<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.309> would<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.850> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
coming off that which would be what I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.420 
coming off that which would be what I
would<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.210> attach<00:00:49.160> whatever<00:00:50.160> I'm

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
would actually attach whatever I'm

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.939 
would actually attach whatever I'm
cutting<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.320> makes<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:52.590> useful

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
cutting up there makes for a very useful

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.240 
cutting up there makes for a very useful
tool<00:00:53.430> save<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.149> time<00:00:54.949> between<00:00:55.949> the

tool save some time between the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.660 
tool save some time between the
up-and-down<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.379> lowering<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> untying<00:00:59.430> on

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
up-and-down of lowering and untying on

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
up-and-down of lowering and untying on
the<00:00:59.760> ground<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.239> raising<00:01:00.420> back<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the ground and then raising back up to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860 
the ground and then raising back up to
me<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> having<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> tire<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> great

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
me and having a tire off so it's a great

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
me and having a tire off so it's a great
time-saver<00:01:04.140> great<00:01:04.799> anchor<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:06.890> another

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
time-saver great anchor for that another

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.700 
time-saver great anchor for that another
great<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
great use for it is for if you do have a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
great use for it is for if you do have a
larger<00:01:11.250> stem<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.780> ahead<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:14.000> balance

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
larger stem you can go ahead and balance

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.380 
larger stem you can go ahead and balance
it<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.900> doing<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.380> crane<00:01:16.650> job

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
it out as if you are doing a crane job

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.340 
it out as if you are doing a crane job
basically<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:18.840> your<00:01:18.930> spider<00:01:19.170> legs

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
basically just think your spider legs

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.190 
basically just think your spider legs
once<00:01:19.619> again<00:01:20.240> feel<00:01:21.240> out<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> distance<00:01:21.900> get

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
once again feel out the distance get

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.990 
once again feel out the distance get
your<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.740> balance<00:01:23.159> point<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> make<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
your get your balance point and make the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
your get your balance point and make the
cut<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> nice<00:01:25.229> balanced<00:01:25.680> piece

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
cut and have a nice balanced piece

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.789 
cut and have a nice balanced piece
coming<00:01:26.250> down<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.780> do<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> couple<00:01:28.290> examples

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
coming down I do have a couple examples

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:48.840 
coming down I do have a couple examples
of<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:28.950> show<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:29.939> now
