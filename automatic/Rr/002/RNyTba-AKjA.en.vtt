00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
columns on the periodic table are called

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.080 
columns on the periodic table are called
groups<00:00:07.530> or<00:00:07.740> chemical<00:00:08.100> families<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.639> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
groups or chemical families and the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.820 
groups or chemical families and the
elements<00:00:09.450> within<00:00:09.600> a<00:00:09.930> column<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.440> similar

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
elements within a column have similar

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.039 
elements within a column have similar
chemical<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.400> physical<00:00:11.520> properties<00:00:12.180> in<00:00:12.389> this

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
chemical and physical properties in this

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.420 
chemical and physical properties in this
video<00:00:13.440> we're<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.680> to<00:00:13.770> look<00:00:13.889> at<00:00:14.039> the<00:00:14.160> group

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
video we're going to look at the group

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.000 
video we're going to look at the group
called<00:00:14.789> the<00:00:15.270> alkali<00:00:15.719> metals<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> alkali

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
called the alkali metals and the alkali

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.470 
called the alkali metals and the alkali
metals<00:00:17.400> are<00:00:17.520> right<00:00:17.700> here<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.000> Group<00:00:18.210> one

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
metals are right here in Group one

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.689 
metals are right here in Group one
hydrogen<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.890> part<00:00:20.190> of<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> alkali

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
hydrogen is not a part of the alkali

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.580 
hydrogen is not a part of the alkali
metals<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.269> so<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> group<00:00:22.109> starts<00:00:22.470> with

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
metals and so this group starts with

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.130 
metals and so this group starts with
webm<00:00:23.039> let's<00:00:23.730> take<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.779> first

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
webm let's take a look at the first

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529 
webm let's take a look at the first
three<00:00:25.439> alkali<00:00:25.949> metals<00:00:26.369> lithium<00:00:26.609> sodium<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
three alkali metals lithium sodium and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.079 
three alkali metals lithium sodium and
potassium<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.189> some<00:00:29.369> samples<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
potassium so here I have some samples of

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.460 
potassium so here I have some samples of
each<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> these<00:00:30.660> metals<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.230> let's<00:00:31.349> take

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
each one of these metals and let's take

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.560 
each one of these metals and let's take
a<00:00:31.529> look<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.859> their<00:00:31.980> physical<00:00:32.220> properties<00:00:32.940> we

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
a look at their physical properties we

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.080 
a look at their physical properties we
can<00:00:33.720> see<00:00:33.900> that<00:00:33.990> they're<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.320> solid<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:35.040> room

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
can see that they're all solid at room

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.880 
can see that they're all solid at room
temperature<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> small<00:00:37.350> sample<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
temperature and I have a small sample of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
temperature and I have a small sample of
each<00:00:38.039> one<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.700> could<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.030> now

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
each one here so we could see that now

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.209 
each one here so we could see that now
they<00:00:39.899> look<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.289> they're<00:00:40.530> different<00:00:40.890> colors

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
they look like they're different colors

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.330 
they look like they're different colors
but<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.989> thing<00:00:43.289> about<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.680> alkali<00:00:44.039> metals

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
but one thing about these alkali metals

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.490 
but one thing about these alkali metals
is<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:44.730> extremely<00:00:45.149> soft<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is that they're extremely soft and so I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
is that they're extremely soft and so I
can<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:46.770> cut<00:00:47.219> into<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> knife

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can actually cut into them with a knife

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.779 
can actually cut into them with a knife
here<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.750> cutting<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.199> lithium<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
here I'm cutting into lithium and when I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
here I'm cutting into lithium and when I
look<00:00:51.000> inside<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> could<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.109> lithium<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
look inside I could see that lithium is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.090 
look inside I could see that lithium is
quite<00:00:52.949> shiny<00:00:53.510> inside<00:00:54.680> once<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.769> get<00:00:55.890> rid<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
quite shiny inside once we get rid of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.430 
quite shiny inside once we get rid of
all<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.460> oxidation<00:00:57.000> there<00:00:57.359> let's<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
all that oxidation there let's do the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
all that oxidation there let's do the
same<00:00:58.649> thing<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.039> sodium<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.609> now<00:01:00.149> lithium

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
same thing with sodium here now lithium

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.319 
same thing with sodium here now lithium
was<00:01:00.899> easy<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.590> cut<00:01:01.769> through<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.309> still<00:01:02.519> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
was easy to cut through but it's still a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.740 
was easy to cut through but it's still a
little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.199> difficult<00:01:05.450> sodium<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> other

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
little bit difficult sodium on the other

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.940 
little bit difficult sodium on the other
hands<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.950> very<00:01:08.460> easily<00:01:08.790> cuts<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.830> we

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
hands very very easily cuts and if we

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
hands very very easily cuts and if we
look<00:01:11.159> inside<00:01:11.400> sodium<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> it's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
look inside sodium we can see that it's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.429 
look inside sodium we can see that it's
also<00:01:13.229> pretty<00:01:13.560> shiny<00:01:13.920> inside<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:15.439> now

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
also pretty shiny inside of there now

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.410 
also pretty shiny inside of there now
since<00:01:16.740> sodium<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.820> bit<00:01:17.970> softer

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
since sodium was a little bit softer

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
since sodium was a little bit softer
than<00:01:18.450> lithium<00:01:18.979> I'm<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> expect<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.610> trend

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
than lithium I'm going to expect a trend

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.240 
than lithium I'm going to expect a trend
here<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.360> show<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.860> potassium<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.979> even

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
here to show that potassium is even

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
here to show that potassium is even
softer<00:01:23.430> than<00:01:23.670> those<00:01:23.909> soon<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.329> I<00:01:24.420> cut<00:01:24.630> through

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
softer than those soon as I cut through

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.770 
softer than those soon as I cut through
potassium<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:27.090> easy<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.570> cut

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
potassium it's very very easy to cut

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
potassium it's very very easy to cut
through<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.530> look<00:01:28.710> inside<00:01:29.100> once<00:01:29.369> again

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
through and if I look inside once again

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
through and if I look inside once again
we<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.939> same<00:01:30.000> shiny<00:01:30.659> color<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
we have that same shiny color and so the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.039 
we have that same shiny color and so the
physical<00:01:32.640> properties<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.149> these<00:01:33.570> three

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
physical properties of these three

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740 
physical properties of these three
elements<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.740> similar<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.210> continue

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
elements are similar now if we continue

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
elements are similar now if we continue
down<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> periodic<00:01:37.590> table<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.340> next<00:01:38.369> one

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
down the periodic table to the next one

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.280 
down the periodic table to the next one
it<00:01:39.420> would<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.720> rubidium

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
it would be rubidium

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.920 
it would be rubidium
and<00:01:40.490> rubidium<00:01:41.490> based<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.149> this<00:01:42.390> trend<00:01:42.750> we

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and rubidium based on this trend we

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.550 
and rubidium based on this trend we
would<00:01:43.049> expect<00:01:43.320> rubidium<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.310> even<00:01:45.060> softer

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.249 

I said<00:01:50.860> before<00:01:51.299> elements<00:01:52.299> within<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:53.020> same

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
I said before elements within the same

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.749 
I said before elements within the same
column<00:01:53.680> have<00:01:53.829> similar<00:01:54.250> physical<00:01:54.640> and

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
column have similar physical and

mentioned about the alkali metals is

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.910 
mentioned about the alkali metals is
that<00:01:58.479> they're<00:01:58.600> extremely<00:01:59.110> reactive<00:01:59.590> they're

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
that they're extremely reactive they're

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920 
that they're extremely reactive they're
the<00:02:00.039> most<00:02:00.280> reactive<00:02:00.759> of<00:02:00.909> all<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.180> metals<00:02:01.479> if

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
you can notice each of these elements

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.300 
you can notice each of these elements
look<00:02:04.299> like<00:02:04.570> they're<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:05.110> water<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.860> actually

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
look like they're in water and actually

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.339 
look like they're in water and actually
they're<00:02:06.729> in<00:02:06.759> some<00:02:07.179> mineral<00:02:07.539> oil<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.960> mineral

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
they're in some mineral oil and mineral

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.589 
they're in some mineral oil and mineral
oil<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.739> actually<00:02:09.069> protecting<00:02:09.700> them<00:02:09.880> from<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
oil is actually protecting them from the

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.110 
oil is actually protecting them from the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
water vapor that's in the air these

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.509 
water vapor that's in the air these
elements<00:02:13.690> are<00:02:13.870> really<00:02:14.440> really<00:02:14.860> reactive<00:02:15.370> to

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
elements are really really reactive to

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.160 
elements are really really reactive to
water<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.239> some<00:02:16.480> beakers<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:17.080> of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
water and I have some beakers here of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.960 
water and I have some beakers here of
water<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.739> we'll<00:02:18.250> take<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.459> look<00:02:18.700> at<00:02:18.819> their

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
water and we'll take a look at their

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.610 
water and we'll take a look at their
reactivity<00:02:19.420> let's<00:02:19.750> go<00:02:19.870> ahead<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.260> start<00:02:20.470> with

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
reactivity let's go ahead and start with

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.100 
reactivity let's go ahead and start with
lithium<00:02:21.069> will<00:02:21.640> drop<00:02:21.880> lithium<00:02:22.330> into<00:02:22.750> this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
lithium will drop lithium into this

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.190 
lithium will drop lithium into this
beaker<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.650> water<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:25.049> see<00:02:26.049> what

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
beaker of water and just see what

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.720 
beaker of water and just see what
happens<00:02:26.560> we'll<00:02:26.739> make<00:02:26.890> some<00:02:27.069> observations

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
happens we'll make some observations

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
happens we'll make some observations
here<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.120> its<00:02:28.299> reactivity

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.250 

now<00:02:35.550> as<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.209> we<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> lot<00:02:37.230> of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
now as you can see we have a lot of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.740 
now as you can see we have a lot of
bubbling<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.159> we<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.209> what<00:02:39.420> looks<00:02:39.659> like

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
bubbling and we have what looks like

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.660 
bubbling and we have what looks like
some<00:02:40.110> smoke<00:02:40.620> being<00:02:40.890> produced<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.489> is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
some smoke being produced this is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.300 
some smoke being produced this is
actually<00:02:42.000> water<00:02:42.269> vapor<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:43.620> reaction<00:02:44.190> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
actually water vapor this reaction is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.089 
actually water vapor this reaction is
quite<00:02:44.519> hot<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.049> water<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.709> actually

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
quite hot and so the water is actually

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.460 
quite hot and so the water is actually
starting<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> boil<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.450> surrounding<00:02:49.200> piece

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
starting to boil that surrounding piece

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.300 
starting to boil that surrounding piece
this<00:02:50.010> piece<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.430> Lippman<00:02:51.530> if<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.769> touch<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
this piece of Lippman if I touch the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.009 
this piece of Lippman if I touch the
beer<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.670> can<00:02:53.849> even<00:02:54.030> feel<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> water<00:02:54.870> is

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
beer I can even feel that the water is

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.720 
beer I can even feel that the water is
getting<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.349> little<00:02:55.560> bit<00:02:55.799> one<00:02:56.160> as<00:02:56.400> this

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
getting a little bit one as this

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.979 
getting a little bit one as this
continues<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.390> react

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
continues to react

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.080 
continues to react
now<00:02:58.530> all<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.920> bubbling<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.610> producing

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
now all that bubbling is producing

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.110 
now all that bubbling is producing
hydrogen<00:03:00.360> gas<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.260> heat<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.489> not<00:03:02.730> quite

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
hydrogen gas the heat is not quite

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.420 
hydrogen gas the heat is not quite
enough<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> ignite<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.440> hydrogen<00:03:04.829> gas<00:03:05.129> and

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
enough to ignite that hydrogen gas and

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.949 
enough to ignite that hydrogen gas and
so<00:03:05.579> we<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.849> continue<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.360> keep<00:03:06.659> producing

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
so we just continue to keep producing

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.289 
so we just continue to keep producing
them<00:03:10.160> ok<00:03:11.160> let's<00:03:11.400> take<00:03:11.549> a<00:03:11.610> look<00:03:11.849> at<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> next

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
them ok let's take a look at the next

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.170 
them ok let's take a look at the next
one<00:03:12.420> here<00:03:12.480> let's<00:03:12.750> take<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> look<00:03:13.170> at<00:03:13.290> sodium<00:03:14.180> so

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
one here let's take a look at sodium so

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.849 
one here let's take a look at sodium so
we'll<00:03:15.329> drop<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.540> piece<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.989> sodium<00:03:16.319> in<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
we'll drop a piece of sodium in the

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.710 
we'll drop a piece of sodium in the
water<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.340> make<00:03:17.700> some<00:03:17.910> observations<00:03:18.540> and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
water and make some observations and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.210 
water and make some observations and
kind<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.900> compare<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.410> reactivity<00:03:19.859> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
kind of compare the reactivity to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.099 
kind of compare the reactivity to
lithium<00:03:23.060> as<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.239> can<00:03:24.359> see<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:24.690> quite<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.019> bit

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
lithium as you can see it's quite a bit

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.009 
lithium as you can see it's quite a bit
more<00:03:25.319> reactive<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:27.090> producing<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.599> lot<00:03:27.810> more

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
more reactive for producing a lot more

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.900 
more reactive for producing a lot more
water<00:03:28.230> vapour<00:03:28.560> there's<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.920> lot<00:03:29.129> more<00:03:29.310> bubbling

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
water vapour there's a lot more bubbling

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.789 
water vapour there's a lot more bubbling
and<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.450> lot<00:03:30.629> more<00:03:30.810> heat<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.230> being<00:03:31.379> produced

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
and a lot more heat is being produced

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.610 
and a lot more heat is being produced
now<00:03:33.859> once<00:03:34.859> again<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.220> can<00:03:35.459> feel<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.090> water

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
now once again I can feel that the water

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.229 
now once again I can feel that the water
inside<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.799> beaker<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.370> getting<00:03:38.760> quite<00:03:38.910> warm

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
inside the beaker is getting quite warm

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.650 
inside the beaker is getting quite warm
as<00:03:39.769> this<00:03:40.769> continues<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.400> react<00:03:41.669> still<00:03:42.389> not

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
as this continues to react still not

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.509 
as this continues to react still not
quite<00:03:42.840> enough<00:03:43.139> heat<00:03:43.440> though<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:44.160> actually

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
quite enough heat though to actually

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.220 
quite enough heat though to actually
make<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.030> hydrogen<00:03:45.239> gas<00:03:45.540> that's<00:03:45.989> being

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
make the hydrogen gas that's being

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.789 
make the hydrogen gas that's being
produced<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:47.069> this<00:03:47.250> reaction<00:03:51.470> okay<00:03:52.470> let's

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
produced in this reaction okay let's

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.020 
produced in this reaction okay let's
take<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.010> look<00:03:53.099> at<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> last<00:03:53.609> one<00:03:53.880> here

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
take a look at the last one here

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.839 
take a look at the last one here
potassium<00:03:54.660> now<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.500> we<00:03:56.130> can<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.489> from<00:03:56.669> this

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
potassium now as we can see from this

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.599 
potassium now as we can see from this
trend<00:03:57.180> lithium<00:03:58.160> comparing<00:03:59.160> with<00:03:59.280> Miam<00:03:59.489> to

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
trend lithium comparing with Miam to

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.039 
trend lithium comparing with Miam to
sodium<00:03:59.970> sodium<00:04:00.180> was<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.480> little<00:04:00.780> bit<00:04:00.900> more

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
sodium sodium was a little bit more

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.620 
sodium sodium was a little bit more
reactive<00:04:01.560> than<00:04:01.590> lithium<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.790> if<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.389> trend

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
reactive than lithium so if that trend

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.530 
reactive than lithium so if that trend
continues<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:04.440> should<00:04:04.709> expect<00:04:05.389> potassium<00:04:06.389> to

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
continues we should expect potassium to

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.750 
continues we should expect potassium to
be<00:04:06.660> even<00:04:06.989> more<00:04:07.169> reactive<00:04:07.380> let's<00:04:08.310> see<00:04:08.489> if<00:04:08.609> at

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
be even more reactive let's see if at

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.190 
be even more reactive let's see if at
least<00:04:09.000> we<00:04:09.209> can<00:04:09.299> get<00:04:09.480> enough<00:04:09.720> heat<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.079> ignite

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
least we can get enough heat to ignite

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.690 
least we can get enough heat to ignite
that<00:04:10.470> hydrogen<00:04:11.069> gas<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:14.069> there<00:04:14.280> we<00:04:14.370> can<00:04:14.489> see

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
that hydrogen gas and there we can see

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.670 
that hydrogen gas and there we can see
definitely<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.359> lot<00:04:15.630> more<00:04:15.660> reactive<00:04:16.349> gated

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
definitely a lot more reactive gated

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.089 
definitely a lot more reactive gated
potassium<00:04:17.900> much<00:04:18.900> quicker<00:04:19.260> reaction<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.070> lot

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
potassium much quicker reaction a lot

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.790 
potassium much quicker reaction a lot
more<00:04:20.519> heat<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.209> even<00:04:21.930> enough<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.380> ignite<00:04:22.740> that

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
more heat and even enough to ignite that

more heat and even enough to ignite that
hydrogen<00:04:23.460> gas<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:25.490> those<00:04:26.490> are<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.729> chemical

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
hydrogen gas and those are the chemical

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.200 
hydrogen gas and those are the chemical
