00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.880
 I liked them when I tried them on 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.880

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.090

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.579

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.240
 despite the late time there is a stage 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.240
 someone is speaking 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.870
 some local teams 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.870
 I 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.270

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.020

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.190

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.190
 dreadfully i dictate 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.260
 here at last I am very tired from home 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.360
 Iâ€™ll honestly say these two weekend days and 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.100
 I do what I go shopping for myself 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.139
 buy some more or less warm 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.080
 things because it's just cold 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.639
 suddenly very quickly for roses for me 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.400
 gave a birthday present 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.490
 I really like those here 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.780
 red roses they smell very good 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.030
 in general for me if the rose does not smell well 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.060
 Of course I am pleased but somehow I do not know 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.910
 I like it when I smell roses 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.480
 every day every sea every hour 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:26.540
 I walk and sniffs beautiful just 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.030
 wonderful aroma smell very sweet and 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.040
 Theros I still bought a toy for dogs 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.530
 And so the principle is ordinary rubber 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.650
 bone its feature is that it 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.800
 Vanilla her very very very 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.690
 strong so weak sweet vanilla smell 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.310
 I have never tried to take 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.260
 vanilla bones in common say that 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:53.060
 dogs like the smell of vanilla so that's 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:56.979
