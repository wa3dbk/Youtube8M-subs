00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
can get it ok so the already in there so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.410 
can get it ok so the already in there so
it's<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> completely<00:00:55.170> new<00:00:55.500> engine<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it's a completely new engine so it's a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.560 
it's a completely new engine so it's a
different<00:00:57.809> level<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> you're<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.239> space

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
different level so you're like in space

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.960 
different level so you're like in space
right<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> course<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.799> um<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.880> like

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
right of course but these um so like

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.399 
right of course but these um so like
gravitational<00:01:06.659> pull<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> say<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
gravitational pull the one to say so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.440 
gravitational pull the one to say so
each<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.340> pull<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> birds<00:01:08.939> differently

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
each one will pull the birds differently

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
each one will pull the birds differently
so<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.720> example<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:11.090> pull<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> can

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so for example if I pull here you can

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.000 
so for example if I pull here you can
see<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> directions<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> goal<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
see the directions and a goal and you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.179 
see the directions and a goal and you
can<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.369> shoot<00:01:15.500> how<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> gets<00:01:16.710> pulled<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
can see if I shoot how it gets pulled a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
can see if I shoot how it gets pulled a
certain<00:01:17.490> direction<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> really<00:01:18.720> changes

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
certain direction so it really changes

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
certain direction so it really changes
the<00:01:19.560> way<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> entire<00:01:20.759> game<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.390> played<00:01:22.640> it's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the way the entire game is played it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.310 
the way the entire game is played it's
the<00:01:23.759> BET<00:01:23.939> example<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.420> well<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the BET example as well just going to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.030 
the BET example as well just going to
the<00:01:25.380> different<00:01:26.450> areas<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.900> good<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.259> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the different areas really good one so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.969 
the different areas really good one so
here<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:30.270> planets<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:31.680> different

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
here we have two planets two different

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.050 
here we have two planets two different
little<00:01:32.159> pigs<00:01:32.340> right<00:01:32.640> you're<00:01:32.790> gonna<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.000> able

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
little pigs right you're gonna be able

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
little pigs right you're gonna be able
to<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.240> both<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> course<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.189> shoot

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
to get both and of course if you shoot

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.679 
to get both and of course if you shoot
down<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> middle<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:37.610> shoot<00:01:38.610> down<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.600> how

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
down the middle here shoot down see how

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
down the middle here shoot down see how
they<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.990> pulled<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.460> i

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
they get pulled and there we go i

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.660 
they get pulled and there we go i

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
get an idea so this is a first look at

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.339 
get an idea so this is a first look at
angry<00:02:28.650> birds<00:02:28.890> space<00:02:29.360> for<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> new<00:02:30.510> ipad<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
angry birds space for the new ipad and

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.440 
angry birds space for the new ipad and
as<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.650> see<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:32.610> very<00:02:32.970> different<00:02:33.269> from

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
