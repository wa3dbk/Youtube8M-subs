00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.960

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:43.229
 This prayer is good in boss. 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:47.580
 such as glacos or gains 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:51.509
 dermis because you wear meiji is a 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.490

 defense to be used will last 10 hours 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.650
 in combat until you tell it to be recharged 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.449
 it also reduces the damage sustained to 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.620
 the magic attack 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:21.810
 Why should I buy this shield? 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:29.400
 this and the onyx ring is the only requirement 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:31.169
 What do I need to be able to do next? 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.490

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.229

 that he is not so wanted I do not know 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.590
 I think that's it she was just a video 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:04.650
 very quick 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:07.770
 you can not show the power of your 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.289
 Prayers because you can not feel much 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.090
 difference but this is it 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:17.849
 I explained right now that the 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.419

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:24.419

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.729

 What does but I'm going to run after? 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:36.449
