00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.250
 this is all world past video lunar audio 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.969
 blade 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.969
 more precisely with 1 here actually 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:24.860
 that's a tile 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.860
 on the already finished tool 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:40.320
 that is, play here and here all together 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.320
 this 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:57.300
 The picture turned steel with 90 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:01:07.560
 all 2 units 120 millimeters length 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:07.560
 stick somewhere 114 time this is 115 here 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 I did a little bit like that here 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:25.549
 shallow such a flat transition for not 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.130
 power thin cut that is there things 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:36.200
 so the handle exactly the emphasis in the handle goes to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:41.390
 in this sense , you can see that we are comfortable 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:45.560
 It turns out very much from its own 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.220
 And I want to show an interesting moment very much 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.119
 interesting and working with wood is and 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.439
 of course it was necessary to show it earlier but 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:00.819
 look here is cocobolo wood 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.360
 the handle was made of the same 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.360
 see the difference 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.459
 this is the top now a little bit for us 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.500
 what is similar to the same work here 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.230
 say he is not polished there all 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.569
 things look and he is redder but what 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.349
 redder if painted but soaked with oil 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.769
 both here will still imbued Drolet 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.450
 darker and be brighter and the trees when 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.599
 pick up the burden live look like here 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.269
 we go to the prototype 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.510
 can say which bakuta greens 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.930
 Malinche to them Anya he is turning green 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.530
 oxidized in the air here for some reason 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.950
 It was shown immediately because the handle 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.159
 We now darkened ie it 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.489
 initially here after impregnation treatment 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:09.209
 she was even brighter 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:12.299
 that is oldag well here 's this ear 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:17.389
 look for a yellow track such a yellowish 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:23.000
 all these places were colors 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:25.980
 about yellowish such as pine and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.940
 now they already see acquires such 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.940
 here is an interesting color 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.910
 that is, the tree will darken with time 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.910
 most likely there will be more such 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.240
 contrasting interesting here yet 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.230
 Kabalova does not change the healer to distribute 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.940
 so this Russian she's from fast as 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.190
 if it happened that you fell here 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.650
 It appeared when you open the layers 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.470
 there is so Amur you won't see where there 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.230
 what's actually happening here may 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.860
 a little bit how one-time we have know not 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.080
 the fact that it will be worse with them sometime 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.560
 here you see the handle here is pink 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.000
 This Kabbalah handbag has arrived 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.450
 daisy interspersing principle trees 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.250
 beautiful extra bar and no man 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:29.250
 very well polished see here it is 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:33.729
 impregnated three in wax . on wax 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.270
 also a casey taker and very good but 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.200
 Krell first I got exactly what 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.540
 coverage that I would like 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.110
 get here with this wax timber 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.750
 kraz teens they are basically the same about 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.970
 speed with such a box remember 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.250
 showed iron 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.020
 and just apparently due to the fact that 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.450
 finally i use grinding 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.539
 motor beside i mean i'm polished 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.289
 the circles they are manually there not on the drill and yet 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:10.600
 what it turns out ok 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:13.030
 you stand the time he prepares 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.539
 ie, dries up and the cart and then the 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.740
 polished it turns out as you like 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:24.930
 perhaps the module is first implemented here 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.539
 not so here went to the top 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.530
 in order to realize only 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:35.729
 stitched free suspension freely 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.699
 the suspension is removable on the screw here stitched 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.520
 there is such a small embossing 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:46.009
 here you need continuous here because 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:51.000
 Well, Basil do wrapped 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:53.610
 property in seams worn out balashov 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.650
 this turned out the magic as much as possible 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.830
 tried he tried to maximize 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.979
 thin here this distance from low 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.449
 lest he stick out he doesn't fall bulky 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:10.770
 Well, actually, and about such a string 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:15.949
 that is, for wearing too, agreed 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.949
 he can naturally take it off here 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:30.349
 calmly here is engaged here if you don't 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.250
 use to talk as you can 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:38.479
 that is, again, an interesting such moment 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:42.020
 also became clearly not falling out 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:45.300
 arises very decently very calmly 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.900
 by the way this knife this seam he see 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.610
 but it becomes a focus for the finger 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:55.909
 not this dinner through the most so glistened 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.960
 that is, you understand 1 cor 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:03.550
 here she is 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:06.630
 All here is of course hand carving 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:13.150
 cute looks once again 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:16.120
 some russian water ro that's thin 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:21.340
 accented cut to become martial arts 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:25.180
 read here, too, somewhere remained there 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.540
 titanium plate last pieces 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:32.850
 actually too 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:37.440
 But the treatment there is the usual such 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.440
 whose own sneaker brush 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.900
 even here on seemingly titan yes 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.760
 soft such tincture metal and skin all 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.830
 equals abrasiveness especially 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.290
 vegetable to present here a little bit 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:08:00.380
 already polished titanium that is the skin itself 

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:06.600
 such an interesting thing 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:11.810
 interesting stuff that's all thank you for 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.810
 view everyone good luck and fees
