00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 since one of the most 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:10.150
 emotional for which he spent combat from 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.769
 that started almost four years ago 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.470
 I think it was a message loaded with 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.530
 honesty 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.090
 then yes 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:26.370
 and resignation I do not think about you I do not think so 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.370
 but there was a very big emotional charge 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.480
 and I really apologize to the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.270
 public for you 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.420
 for saying something so I think 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 that there is a lot of worry to many people 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 who loves me very much the truth has to 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 apologize for the truth 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.530
 what happens is that I am always very 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.350
 strong always 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 tried to tear down any wall that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.250
 put in front of me but I think that's 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.800
 I do not know if on my achilles heel or as much as 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:13.430
 sacred that God gave me not 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.360
 I do not know I do not know how to say it but if you put me 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.830
 bad remember it makes me wrong to think about that 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.380
 It makes me feel bad that my mom feels 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.470
 impotent for not being able to do something to the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.470
 respect 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.850
 the breasts of me 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.390
 I feel that things always go through 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.540
 to the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.780
 but 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.090
 I do not understand, I understand why 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.240
 but in reality anyone any 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 artist obviously anyone 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.810
 public 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.149
 you see the fans a lot 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.789
 obviously families to children who do not 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.130
 see but in particular obviously the 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.030
 michi lovers are a pretty united group 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.310
 of fanatics 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.500
 the mig and you see 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.539
 and that have come here today not 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.539
 I'm going to sell with your representatives 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.180
 why 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.209
 I understand that I understand that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.120
 they are organizing a kind of 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.150
 wake up a kind of 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.330
 of plantÃ³n obviously for obviously 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.150
 that you feel in this his support 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.930
 finally I think this is due to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.569
 affection of the public to the example because such 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.459
 there's something that people do not understand 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.720
 programs like combat for example is the 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.690
 eagerness to excel and the example that 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.910
 many of these guys is for people 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.010
 obviously from different parts of Peru 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.460
 there are many people who do not understand this 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.080
 michelle soifer started obviously been 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.080
 the girl with much sleep as many 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 children who do not see dreams at home 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.300
 overcoming growth by giving your 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.170
 family his parents maybe 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.349
 they could not empower the boys 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.870
 michelle soifer grew obviously with the 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.510
 effort in their parents in a family 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.939
 humble of windows if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.280
 and this girl who was walking on the sand 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.510
 of window dreaming and thinking that such 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.879
 time someday it was going to be someone very 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.939
 great at the point of effort and work what 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.500
 got if that's not an example to 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.450
 obviously follow in the guys that 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.670
 many times they see an uncertain future 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.159
 obviously not knowing what to do summarized 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.170
 or thinking that maybe his dream is not 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.490
 are going to make reality then what 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.950
 We are talking 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.570
 today michelle soifer aims for 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.040
 work and effort has earned a place 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.040
 obviously in the hearts of people 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.069
 and it 's examples that you have to follow 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.930
 much 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.329
 not only because of being close 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.849
 so much to go out on television but for 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.799
 keep working obviously for 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.489
 fulfilling that great desire is a 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.159
 architect and engineer to be master of 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.239
 be a policeman to be a doctor and also you 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.989
 I want the message we want to give 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.450
 in combat is that like most because 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.120
 that I can say combat most 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.690
 who has arrived here has cost him blood 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.730
 sweat and tears being in combat and yes 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.040
 do not 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.760
 of this job of asking them one to 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.430
 one of the guys how did he start where 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.190
 it came out or I'm wrong 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.670
 you are absolutely right they really saw 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.550
 I published a photo a few days ago 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.730
 in Instagram because I think if we have 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.910
 the blessing of being in front of their 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.350
 televisions to your screens and power 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.590
 transmit very apart from the 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.410
 competencies that see what I said does 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.230
 a few days not that everything they see here in 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.850
 combat for an end suddenly the 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:06.000
 competitions can not watch games and everything 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.990
 but really the end of that is that 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.620
 never give up and if you spend at the end you're going 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.940
 to play that bell that means your 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.750
 dreams or goals and for me this is very 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.020
 important 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.690
 the motivation that I had because I was 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.750
 I told the guys from the networks when 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.750
 they have a dream they have to have a 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.550
 muse or an inspiration 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.490
 my dream all my life since I have 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.330
 use of reason was to be a great singer and 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.690
 travel the world with my music and I opted 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.040
 because my inspiration is my family 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.400
 especially my mother 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.229
 and them 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.520
 they never doubted me they always supported me 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.310
 and it's something I ask parents 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.610
 for their children who support the years 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.969
 they have to have why 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.219
 they only with the support of you that 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.500
 they will really achieve their goals and 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:10.740
 Yes today 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.810
 I did not arrive or I could not be like 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.419
 I really dreamed it 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.800
 it was not because I did not try it it was not 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:23.770
 because I did not have the conditions was because 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.840
 something that escaped my hands but what 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.620
 I will always carry in my heart is 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.430
 that try and fight 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.390
 always and with an engine 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.600
 very important that is my family and today 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.490
 with my partner who is the person who 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.620
 Well, it continues like this because we know that as 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.990
 everything you have proposed you are going to 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.030
 achieve and thanks to him and obviously for 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.540
 always be next to michelle soifer 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:56.830
 and the michi lovers also obviously 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:59.880
 us one last test of the task 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.880
 boss I do with the explanation
