okay<00:00:02.510> this<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:05.720> difference<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.200> clutches

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
okay this is the difference in clutches

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.860 
okay this is the difference in clutches
that<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:07.919> had<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.849> left<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.540> stock

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
that I had on the left is the stock

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.360 
that I had on the left is the stock
clutch<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.500> right<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> monster

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
clutch and on the right is a monster

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.490 
clutch and on the right is a monster
Stage<00:00:11.610> two<00:00:11.910> clutch<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> lightweight

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
Stage two clutch with a lightweight

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.090 
Stage two clutch with a lightweight
flywheel<00:00:14.570> my<00:00:15.570> stock<00:00:15.870> clutch<00:00:16.109> had<00:00:16.440> roughly

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
flywheel my stock clutch had roughly

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.580 
flywheel my stock clutch had roughly
35,000<00:00:18.029> miles<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.600> then<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.960> replaced<00:00:19.380> it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
35,000 miles and then I replaced it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
35,000 miles and then I replaced it
which<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.859> didn't<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.420> figured

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
which I didn't have to but I figured

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.340 
which I didn't have to but I figured
well<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.100> making<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.490> bit<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> noise

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
well it was making a little bit of noise

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.080 
well it was making a little bit of noise
slave<00:00:25.350> cylinder<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
slave cylinder was going out because I

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.759 
slave cylinder was going out because I
had<00:00:27.269> really<00:00:27.779> put<00:00:27.990> some<00:00:28.109> punishment<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.619> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
had really put some punishment on it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.439 
had really put some punishment on it
during<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> fest<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> figured<00:00:30.300> might<00:00:30.420> as

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
during the fest so I figured might as

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.010 
during the fest so I figured might as
well<00:00:30.570> close<00:00:30.720> some<00:00:31.199> reading<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.550> bought<00:00:32.730> this

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
well close some reading so I bought this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.830 
well close some reading so I bought this
monster<00:00:34.020> Stage<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.450> with<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> lightweight

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
monster Stage two and with a lightweight

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.299 
monster Stage two and with a lightweight
flywheel<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:40.110> worked<00:00:40.469> great<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:41.190> only

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
flywheel and it worked great but only

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
flywheel and it worked great but only
less<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.790> 7,000<00:00:42.329> miles<00:00:42.480> before<00:00:42.719> things

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
less at 7,000 miles before things

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.950 
less at 7,000 miles before things
started<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.620> seriously<00:00:44.070> wrong<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:45.480> let's

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
started going seriously wrong so let's

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.360 
started going seriously wrong so let's
find<00:00:46.140> out

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.520 

here's<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> pressure<00:00:53.730> plate<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.260> stock

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
here's a pressure plate on the stock

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.330 
here's a pressure plate on the stock
clutch<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:59.100> wear

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
clutch as you can see it's got some wear

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.349 
clutch as you can see it's got some wear
on<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.570> plate<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:02.010> nothing<00:01:02.370> severe<00:01:02.730> serious

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
on the plate but nothing severe serious

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.370 
on the plate but nothing severe serious
gauging<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.320> gouging<00:01:04.710> nothing<00:01:05.930> looks<00:01:06.930> typical

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
gauging or gouging nothing looks typical

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
gauging or gouging nothing looks typical
we're<00:01:08.070> thirty<00:01:08.250> five<00:01:08.400> thousand<00:01:08.700> miles<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
we're thirty five thousand miles and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.520 
we're thirty five thousand miles and
some<00:01:09.390> serious<00:01:09.720> beating<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.320> track

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
some serious beating on the other track

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
some serious beating on the other track
I've<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.220> looks<00:01:11.369> great<00:01:11.750> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I've actually think it looks great the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.179 
I've actually think it looks great the
fingers<00:01:13.530> look<00:01:13.710> great

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
fingers look great

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429

nothing<00:01:14.729> seems<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.270> place<00:01:15.630> Springs

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
nothing seems to be out of place Springs

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
nothing seems to be out of place Springs

the monster clutch well here's the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
the monster clutch well here's the
pressure<00:01:26.460> plate<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.409> some<00:01:28.590> serious

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
pressure plate you can see some serious

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
pressure plate you can see some serious
wear<00:01:29.400> marks<00:01:29.869> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> pressure<00:01:31.229> plate<00:01:31.350> where

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
wear marks on the pressure plate where

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.719 
wear marks on the pressure plate where
it<00:01:32.159> engages<00:01:32.490> slipping<00:01:33.710> as<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.520> why<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
it engages slipping as to why this

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.270 
it engages slipping as to why this
happened<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.630> no<00:01:36.780> idea<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.530> my<00:01:37.829> text<00:01:38.100> at

happened I have no idea and my text at
the<00:01:38.340> shop<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.119> no<00:01:39.360> idea<00:01:39.600> either<00:01:39.810> well

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the shop they have no idea either well

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.800 
the shop they have no idea either well
they<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.890> an<00:01:40.979> idea<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.299> I'll<00:01:42.689> get

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
they have an idea but you know I'll get

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.639 
they have an idea but you know I'll get
into<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.990> later<00:01:44.180> anyhow<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.509> said<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> fresh

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
into that later anyhow I said the fresh

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.499 
into that later anyhow I said the fresh
fingers<00:01:47.070> look<00:01:47.399> fine<00:01:47.700> nothing<00:01:48.240> wrong<00:01:48.360> with

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
fingers look fine nothing wrong with

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.010 
fingers look fine nothing wrong with
them<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.880> that's<00:01:50.880> only<00:01:51.180> seven<00:01:51.570> thousand<00:01:51.869> miles

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
them so that's only seven thousand miles

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.289 
them so that's only seven thousand miles
and<00:01:52.470> three<00:01:52.829> passes<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> drag<00:01:53.610> strip

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and three passes on the drag strip

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
and three passes on the drag strip
I<00:01:54.329> did<00:01:54.930> six<00:01:55.110> passes<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.649> drive<00:01:55.860> strip<00:01:56.040> with

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I did six passes on the drive strip with

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
I did six passes on the drive strip with
this<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.670> road<00:01:57.090> course<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> huge<00:01:58.290> road<00:01:58.590> trips

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this and road course and huge road trips

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.270 
this and road course and huge road trips
and<00:01:59.689> daily<00:02:00.689> driving<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.619> three<00:02:01.860> passes<00:02:02.189> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and daily driving and three passes on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.359 
and daily driving and three passes on
the<00:02:02.340> drag<00:02:02.549> strip<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
the drag strip and that's like that

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.010 
the drag strip and that's like that
pressure<00:02:05.369> here's<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> pressure<00:02:11.640> disc

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
pressure here's the is the pressure disc

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.479 
pressure here's the is the pressure disc
now<00:02:13.020> as<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.620> see<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.920> pressure<00:02:14.099> distance

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
now as you can see the pressure distance

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.369 
now as you can see the pressure distance
top<00:02:14.730> I'm<00:02:14.879> actually<00:02:15.030> pretty<00:02:15.270> good<00:02:15.510> still<00:02:16.260> got

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379

why other than that everything else

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.030 
why other than that everything else
looks<00:03:10.530> good<00:03:11.209> like<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.330> said<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.140> material<00:03:14.010> just

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
looks good like I said the material just

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:23.449 
looks good like I said the material just
didn't<00:03:14.489> last<00:03:21.590> now<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.069> what<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.250> find

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
didn't last now this is what I find

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.140 
didn't last now this is what I find
interesting<00:03:23.730> when<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.209> put<00:03:25.200> into<00:03:25.409> comparison

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
interesting when I put into comparison

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.210 
interesting when I put into comparison
the<00:03:27.150> stock<00:03:27.450> clutch<00:03:27.860> over<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:30.980> try<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.010> line<00:03:32.190> it

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the stock clutch over the try to line it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.250 
the stock clutch over the try to line it
up<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.519> clearly<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.090> possible<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.930> actually

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
up as clearly as possible it actually

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.960 
up as clearly as possible it actually
appears<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.620> be<00:03:37.739> slightly<00:03:37.950> smaller<00:03:38.159> I<00:03:38.730> don't

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
appears to be slightly smaller I don't

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.190 
appears to be slightly smaller I don't
know<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.060> know<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.540> really<00:03:39.780> can't<00:03:39.989> tell

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
know I know that you really can't tell

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.100 
know I know that you really can't tell
what's<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.769> my<00:03:40.890> perspective<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:42.180> seems<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.989> be

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
what's in my perspective it seems to be

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.530 
what's in my perspective it seems to be
a<00:03:43.140> quarter<00:03:43.830> of<00:03:43.920> an<00:03:44.010> inch<00:03:44.099> smaller<00:03:44.519> in<00:03:44.879> diameter

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
a quarter of an inch smaller in diameter

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.490 
a quarter of an inch smaller in diameter
than<00:03:47.060> it's<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.150> clutch<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.480> don't<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.379> if

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
than it's not clutch so I don't know if

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.750 
than it's not clutch so I don't know if
that<00:03:52.650> has<00:03:52.830> something<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.129> do<00:03:53.310> with<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.700> don't

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
that has something to do with it I don't

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.500 
that has something to do with it I don't
know<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.470> got<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.799> wrong<00:03:56.159> pressure<00:03:57.090> plate

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
know if I got the wrong pressure plate

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.240 
know if I got the wrong pressure plate
or<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.840> pressure<00:03:58.049> disc<00:03:58.349> but

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.760 

now<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:03.060> didn't<00:04:03.450> seem<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.720> fit<00:04:03.840> right<00:04:04.110> but

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770
