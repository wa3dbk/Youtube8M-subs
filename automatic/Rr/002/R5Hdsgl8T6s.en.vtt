00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
We would talk about LCS EU and MSI final in the second section

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.880
but we couldn't cause of other things we talked

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.160
So, let's talk about MSI final now

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.760
How was MSI final as pro-players?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.620
and JoyLuck, people also wonder that how you think about it

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.420
How was MSI final

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.590
I didn't watch it

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.990
I slept cause I was so tired

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.930
Just slept in the hotel

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.620
How about you, Reignover?

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.940
I watched it with team members in the stadium

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.109
I enjoyed it but

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.149
I thought that SKT is better than EDG

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.840
but SKT lost cause the weakness and the strategy of SKT were commonly exposed

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.160
so, SKT lost cause of full five games?

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.060
I think so

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.180
Then, SKT could win if they aggressively tried something at early phase?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.880
You said that SKT's strategies were exposed. Would you like to explain it with more detail?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:39.820
When we played with SKT, Wolf set his rune and mastery for roaming

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:56.340
It means that opposite team could easily take some benefit by ganking to Wolf

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.140
Also SKT strongly prefers to pick Maokai

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.500
So opposite team took Maokai. These happens cause SKT's strategies were exposed a lot

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.460
It is little bit sensitive issue, but let's talk about it

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.339
Some people said that the schedule of MSI is unfavorable to SKT

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.579
Do you think it is reasonable claim?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.100
I agree that cause SKT took a rest for just a few days after finishing Korean finals

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.440
They had critical jet lag, but they were most team which practiced a lot

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.260
They practiced from 9am! Even other teams slept at that time

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.020
They woke up early, did scrimmage, had a lunch, did scrimmage, practiced, and discussed...

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.200
They were the best for practice

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.860
So I expected that SKT would be a winner, but they not. I miss it

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.180
I also miss it a lot cause SKT was so hard to practice

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:28.020
Today Kespa broadcasted that they will give some prizes to SKT players and coaches

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.120
and they agreed that the schedule was too tough for SKT

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.000
They apologized about tough schedules

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.820
and they promised that they will carefully arrange the schedule at next season

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.480
So we could expect better management by Kespa

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.240
The issue could be considered as not convincing If the issue was raised by only fans

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.380
but pro-players also agreed this issue

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.640
and Kespa also apologized it. It's good thing Kespa does although I'm sorry about second place. So, JoyLuck, how was the final?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.660
I think that both teams were very good from first game to 4th game

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.940
but some people in mania columns said that

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.140
SKT's ban-pick at 5th game was problematic

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.680
But I don't think so. It was expectation by Coach Kim

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.190
It was not a miss of SKT

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.919
They already knew that Pawn played Morgana or Kassadin after opening Leblanc

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.520
SKT took Leblanc cause they have confidence to win a game

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.570
Faker's Leblanc was 13 wins and 0 loses, right? It ignores counter picks

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:55.420
I still consider that Faker is S class in the world although we can say that top 2 including pawn

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.340
I understand ban-pick at 5th game. Let's move to the inside of game

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:12.000
EDG was very clever to play at early phase. Nautilus? Right?

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.280
EDG saw that Nautilus took Red and Crimson Raptor

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:24.780
And Nunu and Gnar (Marin) killed 4 jungle monsters

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.940
However, EDG quickly did gank after taking Red, Crimson Raptor, and Blue

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.780
Deft well responded it by pushing minions. It's great ability of Deft

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.040
It (4 man dive to tower) was quicker than SKT's expectation

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.620
EDG did gank at level 2, but Nunu came at level 3

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.080
First thing to sway SKT was this quick dive by EDG

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.320
I heard the voice chatting of SKT released today

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.520
It showed that SKT was embarrassed about 4 man dives

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.260
Only one good thing for SKT was a kill by Nautilus's Dredge Line

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.420
Normally, jungler took level 3

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.300
Normal way is that Jungler came to lane at level 3, Nautilus put a ward, and counter attack by enemies dive. But it didn't work

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.740
EDG did very clear gank. Quicker gank than SKT's expectation. It was so good

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.080
Other thing is that Faker had some lack of play in the game

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:35.360
The first thing is that, do you remember the destroy of mid tower?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.020
Team fight happened when the mid tower was destroyed

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:49.420
EDG can make a team fight because Faker used W and ult after destroying tower. It was a flare of team fight by EDG

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.500
The cool down of Leblanc's ult is about 20 seconds. SKT lost in the team fight during that cool down

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.920
Nautilus should run away. It's ok cause they already destroyed the tower

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.060
But problem was that team members might not know Leblanc used ult or not. It can happen

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:10.409
They hesitated about fight or running away. Wolf used Q

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.320
and he died. Also Nunu tried to attack cause it seems to good to fight

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.800
At that time, Morgana hit Q to Nunu, so Nunu started to fight. But Leblanc still has no ult

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.660
So, all EDG players were alive in the team fight. But I think Leblanc's ult could not change the result
