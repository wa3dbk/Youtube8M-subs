00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
 everyone knew that the brawl 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.629
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.230
 little more quickly because it's me 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.230
 how if the pass 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.939
 It's just going to be a 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:23.830
 360 with his plateau and catch up 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:26.980
 with the feet to start already for 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.739
 trying to launch young people I had 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.160
 good fake passes in what I 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:37.989
 speak for example we import a lot 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 all think a good balance 26 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.260
 common 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.290
 firstly no password you know himself 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.290
 unveils to oka have to try to do 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.760
 turn the dac around the board 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.390
 glaciers at first it's not easy you 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.000
 go see it's going to be easy on the side of 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.600
 things guy 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.090
 it makes sense yes that's cultivate you 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.180
 teach me the basics of the cave on 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.950
 can already begin to practice 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.540
 rotate your tech so the most 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.240
 quickly possible you can not necessarily 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.280
 as well as me here I am not going either 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.369
 to throw flowers to my arms so to little 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.410
 near this speed oman 4000 with the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.900
 arms etc 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.220
 and then easy then get used to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.470
 really stay in the air at the moment when 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.060
 you will face yes no matter 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.340
 what tricks 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.810
 before training well we get 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.880
 directly from landing not wanting 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.220
 touch that right away well stay in 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.399
 air as long as possible 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.399
 so there 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.360
 just just a little talent yes since 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 like that 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 bluntly 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.860
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.500
 looks after you may not know that 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.260
 it was his weary voice and if the result 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.050
 final 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.090
 starts the best is to train to 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.720
 trying to make this gesture stepped 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.430
 so before on the left side of the barter 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.010
 with the left foot there you are at 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.619
 the back of the dec at the brake you 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.200
 go throw with the foot and do your 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.130
 pace so after you know you know 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.330
 if you try to repeat this step 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.120
 as long as you can in 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.970
 Money really trying to be 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.410
 relatively crazy regulars and after 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.600
 with his 2 it's the same thing 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.620
 it was for the throw is qualified 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.110
 after with the hand here you understand 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.630
 in the previous plan here that 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.670
 really good laugh and rotate 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.480
 then world knows how it matters and 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.600
 it gave something like that 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.050
 land very quickly on mi sol 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.110
 a statement is frankly 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.520
 the course of this and it's really 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.890
 optimize it says it's good i'm going to do 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.650
 will go into a loincloth state of mind you 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.720
 go see it's going it's all by itself 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.549
 so here we will continue a little bit 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.689
 for example a rolling tried to do 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.950
 as much as possible when their 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.650
 injuries but a lot does it on the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.659
 ground apart it's not much of a final 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.739
 and you will lose a lot and moment 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:16.939
 it's really embarrassing to advance you 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.939
 launched m 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.819
 amusing 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.640
 more possible since it really has to be 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.489
 well of course your hood once you 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.890

 any of them 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.540
 no matter what the meaning is, you have to try to 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.090
 catch up with the foot really if you 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.680
 are well trained well trained no no that 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.099

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.239
 like that you started to understand 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.239
 and feel the postponement 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.980
 according to the most and that's all and 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.260
 steps to train you
