00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
just keep walking and they act like
slabs<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.070> could<00:02:02.310> because<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.880> needed

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
slabs but they could because I needed

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.609 
slabs but they could because I needed
the<00:02:03.240> black<00:02:03.540> color<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.200> look<00:02:04.380> fantastic

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the black color and they look fantastic

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.280 
the black color and they look fantastic
and<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> middle<00:02:06.360> section<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and this is the middle section of the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 
and this is the middle section of the
bridge<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.069> let<00:02:08.220> me<00:02:08.310> show<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> sides<00:02:08.970> of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
bridge and let me show you the sides of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.300 
bridge and let me show you the sides of
that<00:02:09.420> bridge<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.959> well<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that bridge as well and they are the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.040 
that bridge as well and they are the
same

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
same

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.820 
same
and<00:02:12.340> as<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.300> get<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.660> kind<00:02:15.650> of

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and as you can see you get this kind of

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.920 
and as you can see you get this kind of
texture<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.670> bridge<00:02:16.880> itself<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.540> this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
texture for the bridge itself and this

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.100 
texture for the bridge itself and this
is<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.610> hardest<00:02:19.610> part<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.240> me<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.660> be<00:02:20.780> honest

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
is the hardest part to me to be honest

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.700 
is the hardest part to me to be honest
the<00:02:22.040> Archie<00:02:22.520> Bates<00:02:22.760> were<00:02:23.210> these<00:02:23.420> block<00:02:24.230> chains

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
the Archie Bates were these block chains

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.310 
the Archie Bates were these block chains
and<00:02:25.220> stuff<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:26.150> these<00:02:26.360> fences

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
and stuff like this with these fences

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.200 
and stuff like this with these fences
and<00:02:27.530> they<00:02:27.650> look<00:02:27.770> like<00:02:27.890> chains<00:02:28.250> as<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.820> can<00:02:29.000> see

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
and they look like chains as you can see

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.630 
and they look like chains as you can see

there so I'll try my best to make it big

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.380 
there so I'll try my best to make it big
same<00:03:14.750> measures<00:03:15.140> it's<00:03:15.530> not<00:03:15.710> 100%<00:03:16.490> but<00:03:17.060> I'm

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
same measures it's not 100% but I'm

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
these signs so in the future I may

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.140 
these signs so in the future I may
stretch<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.560> roads<00:03:21.800> to<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.400> sections<00:03:22.850> there

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
stretch the roads to that sections there

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.390 
stretch the roads to that sections there
and<00:03:23.450> build<00:03:23.990> some<00:03:24.230> more<00:03:24.410> big<00:03:24.950> massive

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
and build some more big massive

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.120 
and build some more big massive
buildings<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:25.850> skyscrapers<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.950> no<00:03:27.950> more

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
buildings like skyscrapers and no more

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.490 
buildings like skyscrapers and no more
modern<00:03:28.430> houses<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.000> probably<00:03:29.750> rustic<00:03:30.140> houses

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
modern houses and probably rustic houses

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.290 
modern houses and probably rustic houses
as<00:03:30.650> well<00:03:30.680> villagers<00:03:31.370> houses<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:31.940> stuff<00:03:32.090> like

as well villagers houses and stuff like

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.450 
as well villagers houses and stuff like
this<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:32.720> yep<00:03:32.960> that<00:03:33.560> will<00:03:33.710> add<00:03:33.860> some<00:03:33.920> more

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
this so yep that will add some more

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.640 
this so yep that will add some more
texture<00:03:34.790> for<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.210> whole<00:03:35.420> city<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:35.990> well<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.620> I
