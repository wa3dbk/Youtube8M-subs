00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello, welcome to the new pilates 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.170
 today we will be making the first video of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.539
 series of stretches stretching the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.699
 Cervical region I suggest that you 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.439
 hold each length for at least 30 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.890
 seconds for it to be effective 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.140
 let's always start to keep your shoulders 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.779
 relaxed let's do stretching 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 side 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 I suggest you hold and 30 seconds 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380
 each stretch never leave the shoulder 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
 stand always stay relaxed 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.670
 for you to achieve the stretching arrives 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.550
 up to your limit and insured for 30 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.690
 seconds 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.690
 repeat the process to the other side 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.449
 now secure behind his head and 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.300
 light chin toward chest comes 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.280
 bringing the head and hold for 30 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.229
 seconds 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.080
 Another important point on this foundation 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.050
 You do not push the column too hard. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 make this move on a vehicle in the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.170
 straight and passed my cervical moments 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 good let's stretch now previous region 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.470
 here in the neck with your fingers in your 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.210
 chin elects use up 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.480
 slowly to the limit of your 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.930
 and remain in position for 30 seconds. 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.930
 seconds too 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.700
 Let's play this region here in the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.610
 cervical 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.490
 hold with your hand on your head and 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.349
 light toward your armpit 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.080
 changing a little cervical it will rotate 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.540
 a little and goes in newspaper 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.420
 always remembering to keep the other long 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:31.340
 always relaxed hold also for 30 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:33.380
 other concern that you should 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.540
 having to do the stretches is always 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.760

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.530
 posture is dropped to make the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.280
 Stretching Always Maintain Posture 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.830
 straight and move only the joint that 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
