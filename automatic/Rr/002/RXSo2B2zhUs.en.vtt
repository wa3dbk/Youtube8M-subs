00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
because if it's waterproof thing it's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.350 
because if it's waterproof thing it's
very<00:01:39.679> difficult<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.039> blend<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.490> she<00:01:40.969> has<00:01:41.149> like

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
these two kind of lines here and then

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.279 
these two kind of lines here and then
where<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.280> use<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.149> lots<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.689> get<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.960> color

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
where the use of lots of get the color

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.270
