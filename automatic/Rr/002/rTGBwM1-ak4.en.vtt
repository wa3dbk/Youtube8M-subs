I used to do but I haven't done much
felt-tip<00:01:09.450> coloring<00:01:10.020> over<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> years<00:01:11.360> well

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
since I was at school but you can vary

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the you know the ships and the the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
the you know the ships and the the
thickness<00:01:19.560> were<00:01:19.710> these<00:01:19.860> brush<00:01:20.190> pens<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:23.030> did

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
thickness were these brush pens I did

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
thickness were these brush pens I did
get<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.360> some<00:01:24.630> time<00:01:24.929> ago<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.369> why

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
get these some time ago and that's why

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
get these some time ago and that's why
this<00:01:26.789> one<00:01:26.970> still<00:01:27.240> works<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.860> yeah<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
this one still works because yeah I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.609 
this one still works because yeah I
think<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.460> ten<00:01:29.700> years<00:01:29.850> old<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.240> one

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
think it's about ten years old this one

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
think it's about ten years old this one
yeah<00:01:31.619> how<00:01:31.830> much<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.429> think<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.819> still<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.210> I'm

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
yeah how much I think they still do I'm

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.680 
yeah how much I think they still do I'm
Creole<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:34.170> must<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.940> guess<00:01:35.940> I'd<00:01:36.179> like<00:01:36.539> to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
Creole they must do guess I'd like to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.460 
Creole they must do guess I'd like to
get<00:01:36.899> some<00:01:37.110> more<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.659> only<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.929> a<00:01:39.990> handful

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.040 
get some more so I only have a handful
of<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.740> left<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.539> do<00:01:42.720> dots

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
of them left and you can just do dots

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.889 
of them left and you can just do dots
like<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.819> know<00:01:44.970> draw<00:01:45.300> grass<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
like that and you know draw grass that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.430 
like that and you know draw grass that
way<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.890> draw<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.310> individual<00:01:48.200> blades<00:01:49.200> of

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
way I can draw like individual blades of

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.580 
way I can draw like individual blades of
grass<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:50.569> leaves

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.730 

and<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> vary<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.790> thickness<00:01:58.400> obviously

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.219 

you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.670> draw<00:02:05.880> thick<00:02:06.240> designs<00:02:06.780> like

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you know you can draw thick designs like

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.070 
you know you can draw thick designs like
that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.610 

straight

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
straight

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.979 
straight
stray<00:02:18.430> grass<00:02:19.290> leaf<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.940> helpful<00:02:22.239> fair<00:02:22.720> I

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
stray grass leaf would be helpful fair I

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.479 
stray grass leaf would be helpful fair I
did<00:02:23.319> affirm<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.190> few<00:02:25.090> other<00:02:25.269> they<00:02:25.950> yeah<00:02:26.950> brush

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
did affirm a few other they yeah brush

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.759 
did affirm a few other they yeah brush
ink<00:02:27.700> pens<00:02:30.720> last<00:02:31.720> generally<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.260> way<00:02:32.349> I<00:02:32.410> draw

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
ink pens last generally the way I draw

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.979 
ink pens last generally the way I draw
grass<00:02:33.099> with<00:02:33.340> these<00:02:33.519> yeah<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.660> was<00:02:34.750> far<00:02:34.959> more

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
grass with these yeah it was far more

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.380 
grass with these yeah it was far more
effective<00:02:35.799> when<00:02:36.549> you<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.879> blend<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.330> with

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
effective when you can blend it with

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.380 
effective when you can blend it with
other<00:02:37.599> colors<00:02:41.580> that's<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.700> lads<00:02:43.030> blades

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
other colors that's the lads blades

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:57.440 
other colors that's the lads blades
across<00:02:43.840> there<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:45.090> could<00:02:46.090> destroy<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.080> leaf

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.520 

and<00:02:57.990> again<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.650> could<00:02:58.890> blend<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.430> with

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.790 

the<00:03:03.040> light<00:03:03.280> our<00:03:03.490> greens<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.120> stuff<00:03:04.240> like<00:03:04.540> that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
the light our greens and stuff like that

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.770 
the light our greens and stuff like that
so<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.700> just<00:03:06.820> something<00:03:07.180> useful<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
so that it's just something useful and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.310 
so that it's just something useful and
different<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:08.740> showed<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:10.290> hope<00:03:11.290> to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
different that just showed you hope to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.260 
different that just showed you hope to
get<00:03:11.500> some<00:03:11.680> more<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.010> them<00:03:12.160> because<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.210> think

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
get some more of them because I think

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.540 
get some more of them because I think
they're<00:03:13.510> really<00:03:13.570> good<00:03:13.960> for<00:03:14.230> coloring<00:03:14.680> and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
they're really good for coloring and

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.090 
they're really good for coloring and
just<00:03:16.330> doing<00:03:16.480> like<00:03:16.630> color<00:03:16.960> quick<00:03:17.530> colored<00:03:18.010> his

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
just doing like color quick colored his
