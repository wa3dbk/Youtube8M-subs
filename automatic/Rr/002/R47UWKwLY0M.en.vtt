so it's a really good system you know
I'm<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.149> happy<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.630> came<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
I'm pretty happy they came out with the

I'm pretty happy they came out with the
1.81<00:01:23.579> you<00:01:24.329> know<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> know<00:01:24.630> there's<00:01:24.929> been<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.109> lot

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
1.81 you know I know there's been a lot

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.169 
1.81 you know I know there's been a lot
of<00:01:25.409> reviews<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.039> PlayStation<00:01:26.609> Vita<00:01:26.729> but

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
of reviews on the PlayStation Vita but

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.270 
of reviews on the PlayStation Vita but
you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.390> all<00:01:27.659> those<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:28.049> old<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.649> you<00:01:29.189> know

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you know all those are old and you know

you know all those are old and you know
before<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.729> updated<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.329> twice<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.929> think

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
before they updated it twice I think

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.550 
before they updated it twice I think
maybe<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.189> twice<00:01:32.399> it<00:01:32.640> might<00:01:32.789> be<00:01:32.909> three<00:01:33.149> times

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
maybe it's twice it might be three times

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.859 
maybe it's twice it might be three times
but<00:01:34.560> yeah<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.459> every<00:01:36.119> trophy<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.659> earn<00:01:36.840> on
