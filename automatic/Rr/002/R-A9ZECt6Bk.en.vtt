00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
so if you guys familiar with McDavid hex

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
so if you guys familiar with McDavid hex
they<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> best<00:00:56.309> compression

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
they have some of the best compression

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.430 
they have some of the best compression
because<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> wash<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> dry<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.170> and

doesn't change shape

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.250 
doesn't change shape
they<00:00:59.910> also<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> originators<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.050> hex

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
they also are the originators of the hex

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100

like thigh football pads
dry<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.470> cool<00:01:37.590> via<00:01:38.100> HDC<00:01:38.820> moisture<00:01:39.329> management

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
dry and cool via HDC moisture management

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.960 
dry and cool via HDC moisture management
so<00:01:39.930> basically<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.530> dry<00:01:40.710> fit<00:01:40.979> an<00:01:41.340> extended

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so basically like a dry fit an extended

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
so basically like a dry fit an extended
length<00:01:42.119> provides<00:01:42.479> enhanced<00:01:42.659> fit<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.320> well<00:01:43.530> as

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
length provides enhanced fit as well as

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.050 
length provides enhanced fit as well as
added<00:01:43.920> protection<00:01:44.220> against<00:01:44.430> scuffs<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
added protection against scuffs and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.800 
added protection against scuffs and
scratches<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.259> cuts<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> scratches<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.810> let
