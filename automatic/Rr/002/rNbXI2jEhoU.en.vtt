00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.800 

once<00:04:18.290> you've<00:04:18.530> finished<00:04:18.830> with<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.430> lines<00:04:19.810> use

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
once you've finished with the lines use

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.880 
once you've finished with the lines use
small<00:04:21.350> dotting<00:04:21.920> tool<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.520> paint<00:04:23.510> dots<00:04:24.080> all

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
now create a second row of dots placing

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.420 
now create a second row of dots placing
each<00:04:44.470> dog<00:04:44.890> in<00:04:45.550> between<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.570> on<00:04:47.320> top<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.860> two

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.050 

I<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:58.310> decided<00:04:58.790> to<00:04:59.240> do<00:04:59.420> two<00:04:59.450> accent<00:05:00.200> fingers

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060
