00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 he is welcome at anderlecht punt nl with a video or more refined and this video 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.860
 is about 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.529
 work with folders 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:13.629
 a 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:14.510
 we are going one 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.250
 fans to print varinder if you don't have a window to see the do on another 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.669
 way than normal 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.489
 namely by typing in the key combination or shortcut the function will come 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.800
 the quick on 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.579
 this function is 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.909
 the combination of 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:30.970
 Yes 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.400
 The visitors are actually making you work faster 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.560
 the key combination 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.890
 colmant 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.490
 a piece of cycling every month 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.250
 next 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.280
 That 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.380
 the spanish superpower 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.800
 as a customer 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.310
 after the break window and that Christmas the news or weather window 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.680
 and man can 2 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.320
 close is window but remains 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 the program does 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.540
 that is learned again 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.970
 but we are going to make a folder 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.380
 happen once do manners 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.950
 the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 right now 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.650
 this i can use 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.770
 This is actually already getting a function in it here 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.610
 say your right mouse button 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.140
 furthermore that says it well 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.330
 the owners take effect 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.360
 right mouse button 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.850
 click is again max 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.220
 then you get nobody 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 you can archive here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.320
 new country 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.500
 but also here if you see the key combination I now see that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.800
 was used to new 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.130
 screen conjure 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.620
 new window 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.020
 and this without news market 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.860
 the city is shift 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.560
 colmant 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.040
 taken into account 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.040
 learn this and yourself that works much faster 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.220
 that was defeated 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.520
 so there we go shift 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 lived coached 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.100
 and indeed there will be a new fantastic folder 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.420
 next 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.800
 is blue 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.659
 can and therefore give so found so ice clicks 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.669
 not selected anymore does not sing for the name giver either 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.199
 you can just do it by 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.059
 click on 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.699
 that's a light blue club right away 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.699
 so 9 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.549
 enter 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.549
 and indeed no to test 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.819
 let's go and get some stuff just what an empty run has been through so much 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.839
 let's see what to throw in after conversations documents who lives here 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.839
 nice things so again three ways 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.649
 however, it has not been experienced before 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.639
 man's computer 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.909
 the storm surge barrier 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.149
 do the disk two ways 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.459
 the the strong go this 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.469
 with this event beautiful Nijmegen 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.839
 simply by 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.729
 keep in luck with the mouse button you drag to power he goes too 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.729
 nice open now they close so open 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.509
 and let everything be again 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.209
 also some noise that is celebrated in his collar 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.939
 five places not even turned 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.429
 the other way first again elsewhere 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.839
 the court has this 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.839
 but strangely enough has the test in 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.679
 look for a folder 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.429
 her sister away from desktop and therefore stands 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.429
 the last four of the five new maps are the films 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:32.019
 we have another beautiful one 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.409
 the 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.659
 this beautiful 9 in this beautiful picture 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.619
 the cleaning up 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.559
 they don't go straight to the lingering scum, so the bureaucrats don't 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.909
 dreamland 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.869
 so also found a handy way for 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.129
 click again 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.459
 to keep it 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.499
 drag and movies and so beautiful I miss 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.789
 you can selected movies 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.259
 or here 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.509
 therefore the light blue line around it is in the man movies 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.579
 I am in test lab 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.339
 and if it's too narrow 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:05.979
 at the closure 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.239
 and then I have for example 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.949
 it is now even more beautiful 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.009
 following it found it just done or from an email 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.009
 and I will enter it now 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.009
 the film documentary 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.319
 look at watch this message 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.189
 he actually says that actually the same files are found that 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.039
 what is here is actually correct 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.240
 and for one 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.090
 so I can tell you replace or stop playing in folders 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.210
 in this case replace cloth 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.319
 it is declared dead and so see away from it 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.610
 and has to catch himself 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.340
 so actually three ways 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.400
 to make a mafia is a folder 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.039
 the stops 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.630
 more I can stop a folder super everything 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.219
 video files 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.219
 photos 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.720
 there is no fund imf 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.110
 from your stop 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.159
 and can also investigate again with display options 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.949
 within the margins 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.189
 that's the video about it 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:11.689
 work with folders 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.689
 check for more films because your headline because you are using point nl 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:17.029
 and that you look over it
