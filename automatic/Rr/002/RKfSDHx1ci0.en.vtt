00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.630 
because this is going to be the output
so<00:02:20.640> I'm<00:02:20.730> going<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.879> name<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.060> yolo<00:02:22.400> hit<00:02:23.400> enter

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
so I'm going to name it yolo hit enter

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.210 
so I'm going to name it yolo hit enter
and<00:02:23.819> now<00:02:23.879> if<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> see<00:02:25.110> here<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:25.680> read<00:02:26.129> it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
and now if you see here it just read it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.059 
and now if you see here it just read it
this<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.849> decompressed<00:02:27.810> file<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.620> now<00:02:28.770> hex

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
this is the decompressed file so now hex

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.150 
this is the decompressed file so now hex
editor<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.610> lead<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:30.650> open<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.769> hex<00:02:31.980> editor

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
editor can lead this open up hex editor

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.740 
editor can lead this open up hex editor
once<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.250> open<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.760> pit<00:02:37.040> file<00:02:38.040> open<00:02:41.750> open

once you open up this pit file open open

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.750 
once you open up this pit file open open

the dot Yolo one or the one that you

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.030 
the dot Yolo one or the one that you

for<00:02:50.400> level<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.959> will<00:02:52.080> find<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.440> here

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
for level and you will find this here

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.540 
for level and you will find this here
this<00:02:53.610> string<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:54.000> code<00:02:54.650> now<00:02:55.650> you're<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.459> to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
this string of code now you're going to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.399 
this string of code now you're going to
change<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.910> coating<00:02:57.180> here<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.690> should

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
change this coating here it should

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.180 
change this coating here it should
automatically<00:02:58.890> be<00:02:58.980> set<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.310> 16<00:02:59.790> but<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:01.440> line

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
automatically be set to 16 but in a line

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.190 
automatically be set to 16 but in a line
16<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:03.000> happens<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.540> be<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.930> make

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
16 if it happens to not be just make

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.360 
16 if it happens to not be just make
sure<00:03:04.349> it's<00:03:04.500> there<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:05.040> shouldn't<00:03:05.250> have

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
sure it's there but you shouldn't have

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.089 
sure it's there but you shouldn't have
to<00:03:05.459> worry<00:03:05.580> about<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.690> encode<00:03:07.140> line<00:03:07.379> 7<00:03:07.920> and

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
to worry about it then encode line 7 and

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.630 
to worry about it then encode line 7 and
8<00:03:08.480> right<00:03:09.480> here<00:03:09.900> we'll<00:03:10.890> see<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.250> seven<00:03:11.519> and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
8 right here we'll see so seven and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
can exit on a hex editor now we just

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.229 
can exit on a hex editor now we just
save<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.799> file<00:03:32.190> right<00:03:32.519> here<00:03:32.640> right<00:03:33.030> don't

and we want to compress this back into

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.680 
and we want to compress this back into
that<00:03:40.500> file<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.069> that's<00:03:41.940> what<00:03:42.420> we're<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.599> to

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
want to compress it into this file here

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.580 
want to compress it into this file here
the<00:04:00.090> first<00:04:00.360> one<00:04:00.569> now<00:04:01.439> we<00:04:01.500> hit<00:04:01.680> enter<00:04:03.590> it's

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
the first one now we hit enter it's

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.490 
the first one now we hit enter it's
buffering<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.099> right<00:04:05.280> now<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:06.379> there<00:04:07.379> you<00:04:07.439> go

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
buffering it right now and there you go

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.350 
buffering it right now and there you go
was<00:04:07.680> finished<00:04:08.010> now<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.879> exit<00:04:09.209> out<00:04:09.299> a
