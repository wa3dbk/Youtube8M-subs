00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.449 
garage door and then you want to finally
take<00:02:51.780> your<00:02:51.930> turbine<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.650> open<00:02:53.040> up<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.250> door

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
take your turbine and open up this door

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.940 
take your turbine and open up this door
with<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.700> with<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> bus<00:02:54.720> part<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.230> now

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
with the with the bus part in it now

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.320 
with the with the bus part in it now
lets<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.220> do<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.760> get<00:02:56.910> back<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
lets you do that you can get back on the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.259 
lets you do that you can get back on the
bus<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.290> go<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.830> farm<00:02:59.100> now<00:02:59.970> keep

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
bus and you can go to the farm now keep

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.460 
bus and you can go to the farm now keep
in<00:03:00.360> mind<00:03:00.390> guys<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> farm<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.140> probably<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
in mind guys the farm is probably the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.660 
in mind guys the farm is probably the
hardest<00:03:01.769> one<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.130> just<00:03:02.370> because<00:03:02.549> there's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
hardest one to do just because there's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.910 
hardest one to do just because there's
so<00:03:02.790> much<00:03:02.880> lava<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.600> uphill<00:03:03.959> angle<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.650> I

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
so much lava in the uphill angle and I

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.309 
so much lava in the uphill angle and I
just<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.060> really<00:03:06.180> really<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:07.080> hard

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
just it's just really really really hard

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.170 
just it's just really really really hard
to<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.560> because<00:03:07.709> we<00:03:08.400> hit<00:03:08.670> did<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:08.970> once

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
to do because we hit did this once

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.690 
to do because we hit did this once
before<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.569> we<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> touch<00:03:10.019> lava<00:03:10.230> there<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:10.769> it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
before and we I touch lava there so it

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.370 
before and we I touch lava there so it
is<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.180> kind<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.660> go<00:03:12.780> slow<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.230> one

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
is just kind of go slow with this one

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.340 
is just kind of go slow with this one
guys<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.910> don't<00:03:14.910> rush<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.390> now<00:03:15.780> my<00:03:15.930> friend<00:03:16.200> got

a co-op but your friend does not have to
help<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.549> he<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.540> stay<00:03:24.690> at<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.810> spawn<00:03:25.109> and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
help you he can stay at the spawn and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.599 
help you he can stay at the spawn and
just<00:03:25.440> kind<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.620> run<00:03:25.799> around<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.160> make<00:03:26.370> sure<00:03:26.489> he

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
just kind of run around but make sure he

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.960 
just kind of run around but make sure he
does<00:03:26.760> not<00:03:26.790> touch<00:03:27.150> lava<00:03:27.920> all<00:03:28.920> right<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.430> finally

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
does not touch lava all right so finally

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.550 
does not touch lava all right so finally
once<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.269> get<00:03:30.390> not<00:03:30.810> finally<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:31.290> once<00:03:31.410> you

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
once you get not finally but once you

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.069 
once you get not finally but once you
get<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.100> farm<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.480> want<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.750> open<00:03:33.840> up<00:03:33.989> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
get to the farm you want to open up the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.490 
get to the farm you want to open up the
first<00:03:34.290> gate<00:03:34.560> which<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.400> pretty<00:03:35.670> pretty<00:03:36.500> it's

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
first gate which is pretty pretty it's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.069 
first gate which is pretty pretty it's
pretty<00:03:37.829> easy<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.730> figure<00:03:38.880> out<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.900> then<00:03:39.989> you

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
pretty easy to figure out but then you

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.229 
pretty easy to figure out but then you
want<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.290> open<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:41.640> doesn't<00:03:41.820> matter<00:03:42.120> which

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
want to open up it doesn't matter which

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.460 
want to open up it doesn't matter which
order<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.720> either<00:03:42.900> want<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.230> open<00:03:43.410> up

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
these two doors for first or the house

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.590 
these two doors for first or the house
door<00:03:47.040> but<00:03:47.700> make<00:03:47.850> sure<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.060> guys<00:03:48.180> open<00:03:48.510> that

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
door but make sure you guys open that

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.970 
door but make sure you guys open that

big door and then open up the small door

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.310 
big door and then open up the small door
as<00:03:50.070> well<00:03:50.450> if<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.540> don't<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.170> the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
as well if you don't do that then the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
be given to you but then when I figured

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.039 
be given to you but then when I figured
out<00:03:56.489> guys<00:03:56.640> was<00:03:56.880> if<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.239> dolphin<00:03:57.450> dive<00:03:57.750> over

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
out guys was if you dolphin dive over

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.460 
out guys was if you dolphin dive over
lava<00:03:58.319> it's<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.340> lot<00:03:59.489> it's<00:03:59.790> a<00:04:00.000> lot<00:04:00.150> more

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
lava it's a lot it's a lot more

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.599 
lava it's a lot it's a lot more
guaranteed<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.560> not<00:04:01.709> hitting<00:04:01.859> it<00:04:02.130> than<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
guaranteed of not hitting it than if you

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.059 
guaranteed of not hitting it than if you
just<00:04:02.989> then<00:04:03.989> if<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.170> just<00:04:04.319> jump<00:04:04.500> over<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.890> and

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
just then if you just jump over it and

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.440 
just then if you just jump over it and
then<00:04:05.370> once<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.850> guys<00:04:05.910> open<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.299> door<00:04:06.390> you
