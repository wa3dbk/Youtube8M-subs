00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.569 
Chelsea and he's in the limelight a bit
more<00:03:03.750> if<00:03:03.989> he<00:03:04.290> gets<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.620> bit<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.069> game<00:03:05.250> time<00:03:05.549> I

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
more if he gets a bit of game time I

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.910 
more if he gets a bit of game time I
guess<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.090> we'll<00:03:06.690> see<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> very<00:03:07.170> decent<00:03:07.410> silver
