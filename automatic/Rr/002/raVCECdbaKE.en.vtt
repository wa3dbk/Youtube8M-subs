 searchlight and have a power of 10 to 50 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.900
 watt this value means consumed 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.420
 power and today we need to know it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.820
 brightness 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.590
 luminous flux is measured by lumen us and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.970
 we proudly say our 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.189
 LED spotlights 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.740
 era with minimal energy consumption 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.200
 give the highest luminous efficiency among 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.360
 products on the market let's 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.670
 will conduct an independent study 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.700
 using a conventional light meter 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.130
 for the test we took a spotlight of 10 watts 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.320
 completely ordinary spotlight turn on 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.479
 it in complete darkness Trays our suite 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.759
 meters at arm's length and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.460
 get frankly not high 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.320
 indicators do the same with 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.770
 era LED spotlight 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.310
 judge for yourself the result is almost three times 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.600
 more than a spotlight of the same power 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.820
 let's test light sources 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.130
 other power for example 30 watts 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.799
 take the usual LED spotlights 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.960
 30 watt and era LED spotlight 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.300
 30 watts 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.789
 our spotlight is lighter and much more compact 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.400
 which means more comfortable and safer 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.130
 but at the same time as 10 watts 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.830
 the spotlight is much brighter it possesses 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.590
 increased light output of about 90 lumens 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.780
 for 1 watt and now we will tell about 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.200
 what can be noticed in our led
