00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.089 
in my opinion would be a nice big blade
just<00:03:36.189> like<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.519> Schrade<00:03:36.849> seh<00:03:37.329> bollo<00:03:38.099> both

just like the Schrade seh bollo both
those<00:03:39.340> knives<00:03:39.549> put<00:03:39.849> together<00:03:40.000> would<00:03:40.450> be<00:03:40.780> a

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
those knives put together would be a

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.099 
those knives put together would be a
complete<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.889> two<00:03:42.760> tool<00:03:43.030> complete<00:03:43.510> system<00:03:43.930> to

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
complete a two tool complete system to

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.199

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
give the finer medium chopping tasks and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.089 
give the finer medium chopping tasks and
getting<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.840> big<00:03:47.019> ones<00:03:47.260> out<00:03:47.469> of<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.680> way<00:03:47.799> when

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
getting the big ones out of the way when

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.429 
getting the big ones out of the way when
you<00:03:48.189> need<00:03:48.370> them<00:03:48.489> most<00:03:48.549> I<00:03:49.060> did<00:03:49.900> find<00:03:50.169> that<00:03:50.290> this
