sleep a game that would be like three
games<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.420> were<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.900> every

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
games in one were it not for every

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.690 
games in one were it not for every
character<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> same<00:00:32.099> world<00:00:32.340> each

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
character going to the same world each

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
character going to the same world each
part<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.329> every<00:00:33.570> other<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.870> game<00:00:34.050> takes

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
part I and every other this game takes

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.510 
part I and every other this game takes
place<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.590> 10<00:00:34.890> years<00:00:35.010> before<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.489> first

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
place about 10 years before the first

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.130 
place about 10 years before the first
game<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.300> call<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> prequel<00:00:37.020> one

game that's what we call a prequel one
of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> only<00:00:37.440> problems<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
of the only problems with this game is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.740 
of the only problems with this game is
that<00:00:38.550> every<00:00:39.000> character<00:00:39.300> goes<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> same

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that every character goes to the same

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
that every character goes to the same
world<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.530> roughly<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.309> order<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
world and in roughly the same order the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.010 
world and in roughly the same order the
game<00:00:41.940> tells<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.360> each<00:00:42.480> character<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.840> gonna

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
game tells you each character is gonna

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.240 
game tells you each character is gonna
go<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> different<00:00:43.350> worlds<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.800> experience

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
go to different worlds and experience

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.470 
go to different worlds and experience
different<00:00:44.370> things<00:00:44.550> doesn't<00:00:45.030> mention<00:00:45.300> the

fact that just a different order of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.790 
fact that just a different order of
worlds<00:00:47.820> lying<00:00:48.149> bastard<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.289> ok<00:00:49.649> because

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
this is a damn good game although it's

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.850

up in three parts someone's worried
about<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.329> beating<00:00:54.600> each<00:00:54.719> part<00:00:55.020> feels

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
about that is beating each part feels

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
about that is beating each part feels
like<00:00:55.500> beating<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> different<00:00:56.010> game<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
like beating a different game because it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
like beating a different game because it
ends<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> game<00:00:59.100> now

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
ends as if you just be the game now

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
ends as if you just be the game now
before<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.879> into<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.329> counts

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
before I get into what really counts

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.479 
before I get into what really counts
just<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> fighting<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.010> fun<00:01:02.370> as

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
just now that the fighting is as fun as

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.920 
just now that the fighting is as fun as
usual<00:01:02.640> level<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.210> system<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> way<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
usual level up system is the way it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.119 
usual level up system is the way it
should<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.199> although<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> lot<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
should be although there are a lot of

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.530 
should be although there are a lot of
changes<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> I'm<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:05.909> used<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
changes that I'm not used to what you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.789 
changes that I'm not used to what you
get<00:01:06.689> abilities<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.170> completely<00:01:07.500> different

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
get abilities is completely different

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
get abilities is completely different
and<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.950> involves<00:01:08.400> using<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.729> material<00:01:08.909> fusion

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and it involves using a material fusion

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
and it involves using a material fusion
like<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.990> only<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.010> abilities

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
like they only you do it with abilities

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
like they only you do it with abilities
so<00:01:11.700> essentially<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.439> material<00:01:13.439> fusion

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
so essentially it is material fusion

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.109 
so essentially it is material fusion
although<00:01:14.010> since<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.549> materials<00:01:14.970> been

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
although since you know materials been

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
although since you know materials been
used<00:01:15.390> there's<00:01:16.049> no<00:01:16.200> real<00:01:16.380> name<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.830> meld

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
used there's no real name for meld

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.399 
used there's no real name for meld
commands<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> said<00:01:18.270> Syria<00:01:18.720> using<00:01:19.140> things

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
commands so it said Syria using things

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.780 
commands so it said Syria using things
that<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.680> already<00:01:19.710> been<00:01:19.920> used<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that have already been used you're so

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.219 
that have already been used you're so

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
it unlocks the final part now why the

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.979 
it unlocks the final part now why the
game<00:02:26.760> itself<00:02:27.060> doesn't<00:02:27.299> tell<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.659> I<00:02:27.810> have

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
game itself doesn't tell you that I have

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.410 
game itself doesn't tell you that I have
no<00:02:28.319> idea<00:02:28.620> because<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.549> final<00:02:30.000> part<00:02:30.239> is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
no idea because that final part is

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.059 
no idea because that final part is
really<00:02:30.780> important<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.620> being<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.920> good

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
really important to this being a good

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.130 
really important to this being a good
game<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.549> that's<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.819> ridiculous<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.959> went

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
game so that's just ridiculous I went

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.660 
game so that's just ridiculous I went
back<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> got<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.769> fifth<00:02:34.980> report<00:02:35.280> cuz<00:02:35.489> that's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
back and got the fifth report cuz that's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.860 
back and got the fifth report cuz that's
when<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.879> was<00:02:36.030> missing<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.480> that's<00:02:36.629> probably
