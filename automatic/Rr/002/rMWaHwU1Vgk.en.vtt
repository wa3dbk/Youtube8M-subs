00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.199
 each of us is known to have gods 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:16.789
 talents who more and less 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.480
 let us remember however that talents do not 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.070
 they concern only material wealth 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.400
 each of us has the potential that 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.340
 must try to discover and develop 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.100
 there are those who are more practical things a 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.410
 work the land and you in the iron the 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.730
 bread etc. 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.130
 there are those who know how to paint to sing 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.079
 adjust and recycle etc. 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.559
 however, there are many who have talents 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.160
 even more sophisticated mental speak 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.510
 languages ​​design write process 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.360
 philosophical concepts create poems 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.309
 organize and manage research cure 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.590
 etc 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.170
 who possesses these talents often is 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.110
 aware but unfortunately a part 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.570
 remarkable and bury them because even 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.390
 having the economic possibilities e 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.979
 strategic are lazy and don't want to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.700
 invest for your own preparation 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.260
 scientific or technical and non- cultural 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.119
 they think at all that their own 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.950
 personal evolution and even a 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.590
 benefit for all others 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.710
 these are really wastes that 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.260
 not only do they harm us but 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.119
 the whole humanity that cannot benefit 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.310
 of the gifts we have received from 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.810
 Creator 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.939
 Jesus used a parable 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.479
 rather severe for those who also hide 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.390
 one talent for fear evil servant 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.240
 and lazy you knew I put where 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.670
 I have not sown and I gather where in one 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.490
 fun for this you should have 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 entrust the money the bankers so 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.770
 that on my return I could withdraw 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.159
 my common interest therefore remove 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.049
 talent and give it to those who have ten 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.509
 in fact to those who know it will be given and will be 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.909
 in abundance and to those who do not have it will be taken away 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.340
 also what he has 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.190
 and the lazy servant thrown in it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.959
 there will be darkness and wailing of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.120
 teeth 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.549
 since no man is an island all of us 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.519
 we use the work of the genius of 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.540
 others when we refuse to invest 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.750
 our talents 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.510
 we use our freedom badly because 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.870
 no one lives for himself but each of 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.390
 we 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.319
 progressing and promoting their own 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.269
 person 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.040
 gives one more chance than 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.040
 to progress also to others
