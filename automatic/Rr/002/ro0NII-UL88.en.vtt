00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
okay so this is how if somebody wants to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.439 
okay so this is how if somebody wants to
dip<00:00:26.880> dye<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.960> create<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> dip<00:00:28.650> by<00:00:28.970> these<00:00:29.970> nylon

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
dip dye to create a dip by these nylon

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.229 
dip dye to create a dip by these nylon
bags<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:30.990> actually<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.920> done<00:00:32.399> specially<00:00:32.969> for

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
bags are actually and done specially for

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.630 
bags are actually and done specially for
us<00:00:33.710> they're<00:00:34.710> supposed<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.399> more

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
us they're supposed to be much more

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.229 
us they're supposed to be much more
stronger<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
stronger and then you know for the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.049 
stronger and then you know for the
tie-dye<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> dip<00:00:40.590> dye<00:00:40.800> attack<00:00:41.160> what

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
tie-dye for the dip dye attack what

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.430 
tie-dye for the dip dye attack what
would<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> even<00:00:43.230> though

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
would actually do it even though

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.040 
would actually do it even though
especially<00:00:43.860> done<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:45.149> will<00:00:45.300> actually<00:00:45.780> fold

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
especially done we will actually fold

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.330 
especially done we will actually fold
them<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.559> two

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
them in two

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.180 
them in two
so<00:00:47.910> instead<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.950> one<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.610> double<00:00:51.210> VM

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
so instead of one you get double VM

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.260 
so instead of one you get double VM
strength<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.270> nylon<00:00:54.600> bag<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.969> way

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
strength on the nylon bag and this way

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
strength on the nylon bag and this way
it<00:00:57.629> helps<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.620> garments<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.370> protects<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it helps the garments or protects the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
it helps the garments or protects the
garment<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> water<00:01:00.899> better<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.309> would

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
garment in the water better so we would

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.310 
garment in the water better so we would
actually<00:01:02.820> put<00:01:03.180> elastic<00:01:03.600> band<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.379> top<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
actually put elastic band on top of the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.570 
actually put elastic band on top of the
nylon<00:01:07.320> bag<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:08.159> seal<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.790> completely<00:01:09.510> as

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
nylon bag to seal it up completely as

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
nylon bag to seal it up completely as
tight<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:13.049> we'll<00:01:13.229> actually

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
tight as we can and what we'll actually

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
tight as we can and what we'll actually
do<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> end<00:01:14.850> result<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> dip

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
do is this is the end result for a dip

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.940 
do is this is the end result for a dip
dyed<00:01:16.409> nylon<00:01:16.920> bag<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.409> when<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.439> comes<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
dyed nylon bag and when it comes to a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
dyed nylon bag and when it comes to a
garment<00:01:20.520> obviously<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.650> again<00:01:23.369> check<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
garment obviously we will again check to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
garment obviously we will again check to
see<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:24.900> effect<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.619> want<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
see which effect they want now we can

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.960 
see which effect they want now we can
either<00:01:27.110> use<00:01:28.110> half<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> garments

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
either use half of the garments

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.069 
either use half of the garments
vertically<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:30.990> horizontally<00:01:32.479> or<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.900> can

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
vertically or horizontally or we can

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.550 
vertically or horizontally or we can
just<00:01:34.320> take<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> corner<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
just take a corner of it or we can just

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.249 
just take a corner of it or we can just
take<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.070> middle<00:01:38.430> part<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.140> all

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
take the middle part of it so it all

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.420 
take the middle part of it so it all
depends<00:01:40.740> which<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.250> they<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
depends which I think they want the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.240 
depends which I think they want the
place<00:01:44.430> where<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.299> want<00:01:45.659> sides<00:01:46.250> we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
place where they don't want sides we

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.700 
place where they don't want sides we
will<00:01:47.430> actually<00:01:47.729> hire<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:49.140> nylon<00:01:49.350> bag

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
will actually hire that in a nylon bag

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.780 
will actually hire that in a nylon bag
and<00:01:50.659> put<00:01:51.659> an<00:01:52.369> elastic<00:01:53.369> band

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
and put an elastic band

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.670 
and put an elastic band
through<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:55.939> place<00:01:56.210> where<00:01:56.600> they<00:01:57.170> don't<00:01:57.409> want

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
through the place where they don't want

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.039 
through the place where they don't want
the<00:01:58.310> garment<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.850> die<00:01:59.229> exactly<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.439> this<00:02:02.710> and

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
the garment to die exactly like this and

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.990 
the garment to die exactly like this and
this<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.890> end<00:02:07.280> result

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
this this is the end result

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.570 
this this is the end result
obviously<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.840> past<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.410> showing<00:02:09.920> will<00:02:10.310> take

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
obviously the past a showing will take

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.250 
obviously the past a showing will take
the<00:02:10.759> color<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.180> past<00:02:11.420> that's<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:11.930> showing

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the color the past that's not showing

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.490 
the color the past that's not showing
will<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.430> stay<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.390> your<00:02:14.599> original<00:02:14.750> colitis

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
will be stay in your original colitis

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.290 
will be stay in your original colitis
and<00:02:15.800> again<00:02:16.640> on<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.120> process<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.680> use

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
and again on this process you can use

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.729 
and again on this process you can use
one<00:02:20.300> or<00:02:20.599> two<00:02:20.690> your<00:02:21.260> way<00:02:21.440> or<00:02:22.310> diphthong<00:02:22.760> as<00:02:23.269> well

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
one or two your way or diphthong as well

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.820 
one or two your way or diphthong as well
what<00:02:24.739> you<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.099> actually<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:30.590> is
