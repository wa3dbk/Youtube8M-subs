 minced alarobia started while preparing 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.649
 our minced meat for that is very 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.899
 simple you put the minced meat in 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.940
 a salad bowl and you just add the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.980
 chive 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.890
 we then added two spoons to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 fresh lyon soup 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.500
 then three tablespoons of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 breadcrumbs on sale and we come peppery 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.119
 also meat and to finish 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.900
 you add the egg and there we will come 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.909
 mix well once you have a nice 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 texture we come to realize a small 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.710
 ball that's how I did not do too much 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.130
 big and we reserved it separately on a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.409
 plate 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.750
 this is the result we will be able to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.210
 now go to cooking in a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
 stove with hot oil or to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.540
 come cook do not dumpling for 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.030
 about 5 minutes 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.220
 once the meatballs are well 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.079
 colorful crispy we will go 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.110
 remove them put on a plate on 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.280
 then add the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.200
 and the carrots and after three four 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.210
 minutes you just add the coulis of 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.530
 tomato so there you will leave 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.200
 reduce very slightly 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.600
 you can salt pepper and for those 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.210
 who want to add a little touch of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.370
 sugar to break the acidity of the tomato 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.240
 and after five minutes you will come 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.890

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.630

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.160

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.370
 between and that you will be able to add 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.950
