00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
to mind in our city first of all we've

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.340 
to mind in our city first of all we've
been<00:01:58.310> able<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.729> provide<00:01:59.090> some<00:01:59.420> property<00:01:59.960> for

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.380 
habitat but I think more importantly is
the<00:02:02.660> fact<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.920> families<00:02:04.490> who<00:02:04.700> move<00:02:05.000> into

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
the fact that the families who move into

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.320 
the fact that the families who move into
