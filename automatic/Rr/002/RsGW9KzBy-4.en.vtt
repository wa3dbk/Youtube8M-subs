be reviewing the Calvin's puzzle
megaminx<00:00:04.290> ball<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:13.230> megaminx<00:00:13.590> fall<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.040> $36

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
megaminx ball the megaminx fall is $36

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.029 
megaminx ball the megaminx fall is $36
at<00:00:15.030> cube<00:00:15.240> Depot<00:00:15.540> USA<00:00:15.960> calm<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.800> just

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
at cube Depot USA calm and it is just

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.760 
at cube Depot USA calm and it is just
about<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.279> size<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.699> your<00:00:17.760> average<00:00:18.000> pyraminx

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
about the size of your average pyraminx

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.870 
about the size of your average pyraminx
first<00:00:19.770> off<00:00:19.949> let's<00:00:20.220> talk<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.640> this

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
first off let's talk about what this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
first off let's talk about what this
puzzle<00:00:21.240> actually<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.500> megaminx<00:00:22.890> shape

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
puzzle actually is it's a megaminx shape

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.830 
puzzle actually is it's a megaminx shape
mounted<00:00:23.490> into<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.730> sphere<00:00:24.090> form<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.720> is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
mounted into a sphere form and is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.060 
mounted into a sphere form and is
therefore<00:00:25.019> solved<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> same<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
therefore solved the same way as a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.800 
therefore solved the same way as a
megaminx<00:00:26.519> meaning<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.029> does<00:00:27.210> take<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> bit<00:00:27.599> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
megaminx meaning it does take a bit of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.830 
megaminx meaning it does take a bit of
time<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> solve<00:00:28.970> I'm<00:00:29.970> gonna<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> basics

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
time to solve I'm gonna get the basics

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.659 
time to solve I'm gonna get the basics
out<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.109> way<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.800> turns<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.189> well<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
out of the way it turns very well and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.970 
out of the way it turns very well and
has<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> very<00:00:33.000> dry<00:00:33.360> feel<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.899> could<00:00:34.290> Lube<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> but

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
has a very dry feel I could Lube it but

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.620 
has a very dry feel I could Lube it but
it's<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.340> necessary<00:00:35.969> especially<00:00:36.450> for

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it's really not necessary especially for

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.400 
it's really not necessary especially for
something<00:00:36.809> I'm<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.469> speed<00:00:37.710> so

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

corner<00:00:43.410> cutting<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:43.980> surprisingly

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
corner cutting on here is surprisingly

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
corner cutting on here is surprisingly
excellent<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.180> right<00:00:45.329> around<00:00:45.510> 36<00:00:46.050> degrees

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
excellent at right around 36 degrees

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.319 
excellent at right around 36 degrees
which<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> megaminx<00:00:47.309> equivalent<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> 45

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
which is the megaminx equivalent to 45

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.080 
which is the megaminx equivalent to 45

Florian cuts but it's not like those can
even<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.730> done<00:00:56.879> without<00:00:57.090> ruining<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.660> perfect

even be done without ruining the perfect
roundness<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.590> it<00:01:02.059> speaking<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.920 
shape of it is absolutely perfect
it's<00:01:05.549> about<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.939> perfect<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> sphere<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it's about as perfect as the sphere is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.359 
it's about as perfect as the sphere is
gonna<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> looks<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.100> awesome

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
gonna get and it looks really awesome

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.580 
gonna get and it looks really awesome
when<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.850> rolled<00:01:09.030> around<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:10.080> definitely

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
when it's rolled around it's definitely

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
when it's rolled around it's definitely
a<00:01:10.619> great<00:01:10.890> showpiece<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> looks<00:01:11.760> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
a great showpiece and it looks really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300 
a great showpiece and it looks really
cool<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.450> general<00:01:12.840> however<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.950> does<00:01:14.159> bring

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
cool in general however that does bring

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
cool in general however that does bring
me<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.790> minor<00:01:15.030> downfall<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.780> stickers

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
me to one minor downfall the stickers

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.320 
me to one minor downfall the stickers
they<00:01:17.009> tend<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> peel<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.700> every<00:01:17.970> once<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
they tend to peel off every once in a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
they tend to peel off every once in a
while<00:01:18.360> during<00:01:18.689> solves<00:01:19.170> which<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.560> definitely

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
while during solves which can definitely

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.690 
while during solves which can definitely
be<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.280> annoying

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
be a bit annoying

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
be a bit annoying
I<00:01:20.820> assume<00:01:21.450> super<00:01:21.810> glue<00:01:21.990> would<00:01:22.110> fix<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.530> but

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
I assume super glue would fix this but

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.230 
I assume super glue would fix this but
it<00:01:22.890> hasn't<00:01:23.070> been<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> big<00:01:23.490> enough<00:01:23.670> problem<00:01:23.909> for

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it hasn't been a big enough problem for

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.289 
it hasn't been a big enough problem for
me<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> I've<00:01:24.630> needed<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:26.210> far<00:01:27.210> as

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
me that I've needed to use it as far as

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.910 
me that I've needed to use it as far as
the<00:01:27.420> enjoyability<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> solve<00:01:28.530> itself

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the enjoyability of the solve itself

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
the enjoyability of the solve itself
goes<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.640> pretty<00:01:29.880> fun<00:01:30.090> although<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.659> wish

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
goes it is pretty fun although I do wish

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
goes it is pretty fun although I do wish
the<00:01:31.079> solves<00:01:31.380> were<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.799> shorter<00:01:32.159> personally

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the solves were a bit shorter personally

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
the solves were a bit shorter personally
I<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.509> when<00:01:33.780> non<00:01:33.900> WCA<00:01:34.409> puzzles<00:01:34.829> take

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
I don't like when non WCA puzzles take

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.560 
I don't like when non WCA puzzles take
more<00:01:35.250> than<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> three<00:01:35.880> minutes<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> the

more than two to three minutes and the

more than two to three minutes and the
megaminx<00:01:36.930> ball<00:01:37.200> generally<00:01:37.500> takes<00:01:37.950> around

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
megaminx ball generally takes around

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.340 
megaminx ball generally takes around
four<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.430> five<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.390> enjoy<00:01:39.689> solves<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.229> here

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
four or five I do enjoy solves on here

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.539 
four or five I do enjoy solves on here
very<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.770> when<00:01:40.979> I'm<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> more<00:01:41.340> patient
