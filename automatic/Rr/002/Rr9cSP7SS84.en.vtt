00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.689
 hello everyone guys here 0 35 per mtv 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.640
 Italy and today seen together Manolo 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.380
 gabbiadini the team of the season 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.210
 the player from Naples who received 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.759
 in my opinion deservedly 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.349
 this version in the team of 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.290
 series season a 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.079
 then gabbiadini was born as coc is from 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.320
 80 of general I tell you immediately that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.040
 in my opinion co ca bedini does not make 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.710
 very well 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.310
 and I'll explain why right away 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.830
 gabellini at 88 speed with 85 of 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.900
 acceleration and shutter speed 90 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.550
 these here is a good feature 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.890
 both for an artist dragon but also and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.739
 especially for a central striker 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.380
 then 80 dribbles with 83 checks 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.870
 dance and 82 81 of dry dribbling 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.270
 I think a playmaker needs 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.019
 a higher value than triple while 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.119
 these values ​​are more suited to a 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.229
 central striker to a first striker 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.830
 then at 84 shooting with 94 of power over 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.980
 in long shot totti 81 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.780
 finalization and 84 of good here is the shot 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.150
 è in my opinion it is the only value to be 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.710
 pure playmaker of this player 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.790
 because then we find the passages with 65 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.170
 which are divided 78 of short 44 of 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.200
 gross and just 35 of passes then the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.750
 passing value is the absolute counter 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.500
 of gabellini and is the value that second 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.640
 it doesn't allow me to be 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 central offensive midfielder 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.310
 then three midfielder then to strengthen the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.950
 thesis of someone like me who wants to use it 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.620
 attached we find physically praised with 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.440
 90 precision header and 83 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.229
 discomfort then as a work we have another deputy 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.640
 and like stars he sees weak and steady 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.619
 3 in both 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.650
 then I used gabbiadini 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.690
 as acts or as ancient because precisely 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.120
 that I said the speed values ​​of 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.040
 dribbling and physical and above all the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.200
 low pass value befitting of 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.780
 more to this position does it turn up a little 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.540
 the nose to the finalization of the tests 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.340
 you need to get used to with 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.959
 gabellini maybe pull a little more 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.630
 far because as he says offer one 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.040
 power and love love come really well 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.430
 it seems even more in game 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.380
 the value that has 88 on the card so 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.320
 gamberini 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.970
 I highly recommend it then have 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.520
 everyone is free to do what he wants 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.520
 maybe my way of playing with 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.290
 Gabbiadini it does make it better as 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.140
 central striker maybe you instead 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.400
 midfielders use sites you are 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.650
 used to using it in another way 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.050
 maybe the features of the hats 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.730
 they suit you better then in the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.490
 card of the felt we find as pro the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.580
 log that said 88 with shooting power 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.710
 94 the speed that with cooked adopts one 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.310
 very good speed and the header 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.290
 that to 90 of precision from 73 the salts i 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.350
 against are really a lot of steps 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.420
 all 35 long shorter ones are heard 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.370
 but it really struggles to send into the door 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.630
 comrades and loyalty 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.820
 in the case in which we use it as 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.650
 striker the final vote still feels 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.100
 because for the very good price that ad 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.250
 having very low can be a good e 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.900
 valid a good valid pawn in 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.880
 attack for any team 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.700
 the recession ends here it seems to me 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.170
 a little legs can try it yes 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.910
 you can easily try it 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.870
 try all that see you at the next 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.870
 hello video to all
