00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 I have a few pairs of integers and wrong fractions. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.800
 I want to see what's bigger than the numbers. 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.600
 So, 1 and 7/8 and 39/10 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.000
 You can do it in your mind. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.100
 You may say ... Let me write, 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.000
 that 10 comes in 39 times. 3 times 10 times. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.710
 You are looking for the largest number of tenths that fits inside without leaving the number. 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.600
 We can not write 4 here, 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 because then it would be 40. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.500
 That is, it will exceed 39. 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 3 times 10 is 30. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.000
 And we have a residue of 9. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.100
 You can translate this expression. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.400
 You can record 39/10 as 30/10 plus 9/10. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.700
 30/10 is just 3. 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
 So this is equal to 3 and 9/10. 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.800
 You can do this in mind. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.700
 You can say that 10 enters 39 times and remains 9. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.000
 You get 9/10. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.200
 We can count it in our minds. 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 Now we can compare it simply 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.500
 we look at the integers. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.800
 That's 1 and something - 1 and 7/8 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.200
 and we compare this with 3 and 9/10. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.600
 3 and 9/10 is obviously a larger number 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.900
 Here we have 3 instead of 1. 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.100
 That's why we're writing a sign for less. 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.920
 I remember the following - the open part of the character always points to the larger number. 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.320
 And that's the small side, it always points to the smaller number. 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.300
 Let's resolve the following example - 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.400
 We compare 4 and 7/8 with 49/9. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.000
 To make this a mixed number. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.600
 9 enters 49 times 5 times, 9 times 45 times 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.700
 The remainder will be 4. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.400
 The balance is 4, that's 5 and 4/9. 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.800
 We can look at it 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.300
 only whole numbers. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.200
 5 obviously is greater than 4, so again we have a sign for less. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.140
 The tip to the smaller number, the opening to the larger one. 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.600
 Now, 2 and 1/2 and 11/10 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.300
 10 enters 11 only once. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.200
 And if we care about the rest, it's 1. 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.300
 So we have 1 and 1/10. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.900
 Which is certainly less than 2 and 1/2. 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.600
 We just look at the integers. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 2 is greater than 1. 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.700
 Now we still want our mark to be bigger or less pointing 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 to the larger number. 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.000
 We'll write it like that. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.200
 This is the bigger sign, 2 and 1/2 is greater than 11/10. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 The point points to the small number. 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.110
 So, 5 and 4/9 and 40/7. 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.500
 7 enters in 40, let me transcribe this, 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.700
 7 is collected in 40 5 times 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.700
 and then we have a residue of 5, 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.100
 because 7 in 5 is 35. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.600
 We have 5 to reach 40. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.700
 So we have 5 and 5/7. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.000
 And if you seem to be doing some voodoo, 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.900
 just remembered that I regroup the number. 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.500
 I just say it's 40/7 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.300
 same as 35 plus 5/7. 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.200
 The largest divisor of 7, which is smaller than this number. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.700
 And this is the same as 35/7 plus 5/7 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.900
 And then this 35/7 5 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.400
 and 5/7 here is just 5/7. 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.900
 This is interesting because we have the same thing 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.200
 an integer over our mixed numbers - 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.000
 5 and again 5 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.900
 So now we have to pay attention 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.500
 of the part of our mixed numbers, which is a liver. 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.900
 In fact we have to compare 4/9 and 5/7. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.600
 We can do this in several ways. 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 We can do so to get a common denominator. 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 This is probably the easiest way. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.600
 We can translate this as ... What is the smallest common 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.700
 divisor of 9 and 7? 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.700
 They have no common dividers, so they have to 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.300
 take their work. 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.800
 Let's write 4/9 so we have 63 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.000
 in the denominator - this is 9 at 7. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.900
 If we multiply the denominator by 7, 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.000
 we must multiply the numerator by 7. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.500
 This will be 28. 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.100
 Now, make the denominator 5/7 63 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.800
 We multiply the denominator by 9. 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.300
 Then we have to multiply the numerator by 9. 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.700
 5 by 9 is 45. 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.700
 That is clear. 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.500
 45/63 is certainly more than 28/63. 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.100
 We can translate this. 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.200
 Because the integers are the same 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.700
 and 5/7 is the same as 45/6, 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.399
 and 4/9 is the same as 28/63. 

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.600
 We can record that 5 and 4/9 are less than 40/7. 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.200
 There is another way to think about 4/9 and 5/7 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.000
 - if we compare 4/9 and 4/7. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.400
 We have the same numerator. 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.900
 This denominator is bigger than this one here. 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.900
 But the larger the denominator is, 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 the smaller the fraction. 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.200
 The smaller the total value of the fraction. 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.300
 So here is less than 4/7. 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.100
 And 4/7 is obviously less than 5/7. 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.600
 So 4/9 is obviously less than 5/7. 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.500
 So we got the same result.
