for<00:01:12.310> me<00:01:12.460> let's<00:01:13.299> check<00:01:13.509> out<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.840> amp

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:34.230 

you

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:02:02.070 

you

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.180 

it's<00:02:03.070> ready<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.400> be<00:02:03.490> capture<00:02:04.380> turn<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.710> all<00:02:06.100> the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
it's ready to be capture turn it all the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.210 
it's ready to be capture turn it all the
way<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.280> profiler<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:08.020> second<00:02:08.440> button<00:02:08.800> it

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
way to profiler the second button it

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.180 
way to profiler the second button it
should<00:02:09.640> say<00:02:09.850> reference<00:02:10.479> amp<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.890> where

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
should say reference amp that's where

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.810 
should say reference amp that's where
you<00:02:12.940> should<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.150> able<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.490> auditioning<00:02:15.490> your<00:02:15.610> M

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
you should be able to auditioning your M

you should be able to auditioning your M
and<00:02:16.090> right<00:02:16.570> now<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.960> should<00:02:17.050> be<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.320> 5150

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
and right now it should be the 5150

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.340 
and right now it should be the 5150
check<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.120> out<00:02:19.270> make<00:02:19.630> sure<00:02:19.660> that's<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.110> sound

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
check it out make sure that's the sound

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.740

sounds<00:02:22.960> like<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:28.770> also<00:02:29.770> use<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.130> reverb

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
sounds like this I also use a reverb

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.910 
sounds like this I also use a reverb
here<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:31.210> just<00:02:31.600> tend<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.900> reverb<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.680> hear

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
here I just tend to reverb on to hear

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:45.050 
here I just tend to reverb on to hear
what<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> amp<00:02:33.370> sounds<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:33.910> with<00:02:34.090> reverb

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.820 

turn<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.180> reverb<00:02:46.540> off<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.200> go<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.650> next

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
turn the reverb off and go to the next

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.920 
turn the reverb off and go to the next

is a reference amp that's the evh 5150

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.410 
is a reference amp that's the evh 5150
that's<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.410> original<00:03:44.980> sound<00:03:45.340> from<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.090> amp
