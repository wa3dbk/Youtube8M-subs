are on a slant so you're going to want

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.859 
are on a slant so you're going to want
to<00:01:57.830> be<00:01:58.759> careful<00:01:59.210> when<00:01:59.390> you're<00:01:59.509> doing<00:01:59.570> your

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
to be careful when you're doing your

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.840 
to be careful when you're doing your
placement<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:00.619> your<00:02:00.680> second<00:02:01.220> row<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.729> I'm

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
placement for your second row so I'm

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.420 
placement for your second row so I'm
putting<00:02:02.210> two<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.320> containers<00:02:03.860> here<00:02:04.250> on

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
putting two of the containers here on

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.310 
putting two of the containers here on
the<00:02:04.550> second<00:02:04.940> row<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.420> I'm<00:02:05.960> just<00:02:06.110> kind<00:02:06.289> of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
the second row and I'm just kind of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.930 
the second row and I'm just kind of
placing<00:02:06.800> them<00:02:06.979> or<00:02:07.220> trying<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.460> get<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> feel<00:02:07.910> of

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
placing them or trying to get a feel of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.330 
placing them or trying to get a feel of
where<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.239> want<00:02:08.600> them

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
where I want them

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.860 
where I want them
just<00:02:10.340> be<00:02:10.429> careful<00:02:10.610> here<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.330> case<00:02:11.510> they<00:02:11.660> want

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
just be careful here in case they want

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.050 
just be careful here in case they want
to<00:02:11.959> slide<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.470> fall<00:02:12.680> off<00:02:12.920> but<00:02:13.519> those<00:02:13.790> two

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
to slide it and fall off but those two

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.479 
to slide it and fall off but those two
sides<00:02:14.390> there<00:02:14.720> together<00:02:14.900> are<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.590> ones<00:02:15.860> that

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
sides there together are the ones that

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.790 
sides there together are the ones that
I'm<00:02:16.910> gonna<00:02:17.239> glue<00:02:17.390> together<00:02:17.780> because<00:02:18.260> they<00:02:18.470> are

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
I'm gonna glue together because they are

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.220 
I'm gonna glue together because they are
flush<00:02:19.489> when<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:19.970> sit<00:02:20.390> them<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.600> side-by-side

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
flush when you sit them in side-by-side

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.650 
flush when you sit them in side-by-side
so<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:22.489> going<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.700> show<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:22.910> again<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:23.570> I'm

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
so I'm going to show you again what I'm

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.290 
so I'm going to show you again what I'm
talking<00:02:24.080> about<00:02:24.170> right<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.120> how

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
talking about right here this is how

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.300 
talking about right here this is how
they're<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:26.720> sit<00:02:27.080> on<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.380> second<00:02:27.769> row<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
they're gonna sit on the second row and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.600 
they're gonna sit on the second row and
as<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.750> move<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> glasses<00:02:30.470> open<00:02:31.280> you'll<00:02:31.519> see

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
as I move the glasses open you'll see

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.790 
as I move the glasses open you'll see
those<00:02:32.239> two<00:02:32.540> sides<00:02:32.840> right<00:02:33.050> there<00:02:33.320> are<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> ones

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
those two sides right there are the ones

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.400 
those two sides right there are the ones
they're<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.280> be<00:02:34.400> glued<00:02:37.840> now<00:02:38.840> when

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
they're going to be glued now when

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.830 
they're going to be glued now when
you're<00:02:39.590> gluing<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.910> gonna<00:02:41.060> be<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
you're gluing this this is gonna be the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.569 
you're gluing this this is gonna be the
second<00:02:42.320> bottle<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.650> glue<00:02:42.829> I've<00:02:43.130> Dan<00:02:43.370> old

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
second bottle of glue I've Dan old

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.150 
second bottle of glue I've Dan old
makeup<00:02:43.850> brush<00:02:44.269> which<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.079> did<00:02:45.769> not<00:02:45.920> plan<00:02:46.130> on

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
makeup brush which I did not plan on

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.490 
makeup brush which I did not plan on
using<00:02:46.459> again<00:02:47.060> as<00:02:47.420> far<00:02:47.660> as<00:02:47.810> Krazy<00:02:48.110> Glue<00:02:48.440> is

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
using again as far as Krazy Glue is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.860 
using again as far as Krazy Glue is
concerned<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.220> don't<00:02:49.459> know<00:02:49.670> what<00:02:50.000> would<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
concerned I don't know what would be the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.310 
concerned I don't know what would be the
proper<00:02:51.769> brush<00:02:52.489> use<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:53.239> for<00:02:53.450> craft<00:02:53.750> glue<00:02:53.989> you

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
proper brush use but for craft glue you

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.650 
proper brush use but for craft glue you
would<00:02:54.410> obviously<00:02:54.890> use<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> craft<00:02:55.519> brush<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.209> put

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
would obviously use a craft brush I put

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.830 
would obviously use a craft brush I put
the<00:02:56.810> glue<00:02:57.019> on<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.560> putting<00:02:58.250> on<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:59.120> generous

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the glue on and putting on a generous

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.750 
the glue on and putting on a generous
amount<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.769> you're<00:03:00.860> gonna<00:03:00.980> want<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.400> spread

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
amount and you're gonna want to spread

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.640 
amount and you're gonna want to spread
it<00:03:01.940> out<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.560> do<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.709> on<00:03:03.769> both<00:03:03.920> sides<00:03:05.650> you're

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
it out and do that on both sides you're

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.920 
it out and do that on both sides you're
gonna<00:03:06.829> hold<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.400> together<00:03:07.579> until<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.450> stays<00:03:08.660> by

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
gonna hold it together until it stays by

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.890 
gonna hold it together until it stays by
itself<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.650> then<00:03:09.890> let<00:03:10.489> those<00:03:11.000> dry<00:03:11.510> overnight

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
itself and then let those dry overnight

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.350 
itself and then let those dry overnight
as<00:03:12.230> well<00:03:12.440> now<00:03:12.980> since<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.519> thing<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.090> darn

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
as well now since this thing is so darn

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.490 
as well now since this thing is so darn
heavy<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:15.070> moved<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.850> place<00:03:17.540> where<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.840> knew

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
heavy I moved to the place where I knew

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.920 
heavy I moved to the place where I knew
I<00:03:18.530> was<00:03:18.799> going<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.130> be<00:03:19.250> putting<00:03:19.519> my<00:03:19.820> organizer

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.979 

this<00:03:23.930> part<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:24.709> realized<00:03:25.579> that<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.660> was<00:03:26.810> going

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
this part I realized that it was going

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.729 
this part I realized that it was going
to<00:03:27.019> be<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> bit<00:03:27.500> tricky<00:03:27.950> trying<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.670> figure<00:03:28.940> out

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
to be a bit tricky trying to figure out

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.319 
to be a bit tricky trying to figure out
where<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.859> put<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.130> glue<00:03:31.310> after<00:03:31.579> I<00:03:31.820> knew<00:03:32.180> where

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
where to put the glue after I knew where

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.840 
where to put the glue after I knew where
to<00:03:32.420> place<00:03:32.690> them<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.829> as<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.190> see<00:03:34.400> here<00:03:34.670> I'm

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
to place them so as you can see here I'm

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.270 
to place them so as you can see here I'm
just<00:03:34.880> taking<00:03:35.420> my<00:03:35.450> thumb<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.320> then<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.829> would

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
just taking my thumb and then I would

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.070 
just taking my thumb and then I would
take<00:03:37.459> my<00:03:37.609> other<00:03:37.760> hand<00:03:37.850> away<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.600> just<00:03:38.750> see

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
take my other hand away and just see

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.650 
take my other hand away and just see
where<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.340> glue<00:03:40.550> would<00:03:40.700> need<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.030> go<00:03:41.180> for<00:03:41.510> this

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
where the glue would need to go for this

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.080 
where the glue would need to go for this
to<00:03:41.989> stay<00:03:42.230> put<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.830> it<00:03:43.190> would<00:03:43.370> be<00:03:43.550> the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
to stay put and it would be the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.500 
to stay put and it would be the
on<00:03:44.390> each<00:03:44.599> side<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.910> figured<00:03:46.910> out<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.239> was

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
on each side so I figured out it was

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.860 
on each side so I figured out it was
right<00:03:47.840> before<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:49.010> crease<00:03:49.790> in<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.510> bottom

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
right before the crease in the bottom

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.650 
right before the crease in the bottom
row<00:03:51.080> it's<00:03:51.530> gonna<00:03:51.739> be<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.580> one-inch<00:03:53.120> space

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
row it's gonna be like a one-inch space

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.710 
row it's gonna be like a one-inch space
so<00:03:54.560> what<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.310> decided<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.940> do<00:03:56.120> was<00:03:56.330> get<00:03:56.510> some

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
so what I decided to do was get some

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.570 
so what I decided to do was get some
tape<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.260> place<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.800> right<00:03:57.830> there

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
tape and place it right there

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.300 
tape and place it right there
where<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:59.180> needed<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.989> glue<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.200> go<00:04:00.590> because<00:04:01.220> I

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
where I needed the glue to go because I

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.100 
where I needed the glue to go because I
didn't<00:04:01.549> need<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.819> glue<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.000> go<00:04:02.209> past<00:04:02.599> that

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
didn't need the glue to go past that

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.100 
didn't need the glue to go past that
piece<00:04:03.349> of<00:04:03.530> tape<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:04.610> that's<00:04:05.120> what<00:04:05.360> I<00:04:05.390> did<00:04:05.540> and

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
piece of tape so that's what I did and

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.970 
piece of tape so that's what I did and
it<00:04:07.040> worked<00:04:07.280> out<00:04:07.580> beautifully<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:09.349> after<00:04:09.950> a

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
it worked out beautifully and after a

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.070 
it worked out beautifully and after a
couple<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.489> minutes<00:04:10.819> when<00:04:11.090> these<00:04:11.330> were<00:04:11.599> okay

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
couple of minutes when these were okay

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.880 
couple of minutes when these were okay
to<00:04:12.110> sit<00:04:12.500> on<00:04:12.709> their<00:04:12.890> own<00:04:13.810> then<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:15.170> decided<00:04:15.680> to

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
to sit on their own then I decided to

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.550 
to sit on their own then I decided to
start<00:04:16.370> on<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.700> top<00:04:16.729> layer<00:04:17.419> because<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.019> did

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
start on the top layer because I did

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.430 
start on the top layer because I did
have<00:04:18.590> this<00:04:18.919> against<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.519> wall<00:04:19.729> if<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.540> didn't<00:04:21.260> I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
have this against the wall if I didn't I

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.570 
have this against the wall if I didn't I
would<00:04:21.620> have<00:04:21.650> let<00:04:21.919> those<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.400> dry<00:04:22.550> overnight

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
would have let those that dry overnight

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.540 
would have let those that dry overnight
as<00:04:23.120> well<00:04:23.330> now<00:04:24.139> again<00:04:24.470> take<00:04:24.710> my<00:04:24.889> sixth<00:04:25.370> and
