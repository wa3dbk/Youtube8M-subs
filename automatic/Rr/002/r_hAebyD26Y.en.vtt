the<00:00:24.740> only<00:00:24.920> thing<00:00:25.039> I'd<00:00:25.130> probably<00:00:25.400> would

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
the only thing I'd probably would

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.220 
the only thing I'd probably would
recommend<00:00:26.060> is<00:00:26.150> compressing<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:26.840> a<00:00:26.900> little<00:00:27.080> bit

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
recommend is compressing it a little bit

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.080 
recommend is compressing it a little bit
I<00:00:27.259> would<00:00:27.470> redraw<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.099> where<00:00:28.279> does<00:00:28.910> your<00:00:29.000> mom

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090
