00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.879
 Good morning, everybody, we're going to do it. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 technology in 3d but does not have a bit 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.530
 character here is imported from witch 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.270
 It's great with the amount for him but 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.119
 You come to live the football itself no longer 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.480
 you're here if you're going to have to use 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 Good name then you'll get it. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.609
 This will get good here so if you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.230
 do not see you come here and shaped 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.620
 sort of source for de forte 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.649
 reference of girls here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 first you can come here me that 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.969
 drag and play in this electric corner 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.969
 the side comes here on was phone 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:58.109
 here you come in shades off clickon be 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.180
 happy here 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.399
 pitt is that he had already chosen 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 character you come here and click on 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.420
 character 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 Now you come here and you will create 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.750
 a new object about this character 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.210
 so you come here and click one thousand 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.670
 there you only start to build is for 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.700
 you build is the first by law 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.159
 you will have to use vertices then 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.240
 You come here until filda will succeed. 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.189
 put here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.920
 click here 234 make the first 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.530
 square with tight shift you 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.290
 click on one of them and drag the other 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 it is already close then that power you 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.250
 could continue with this tool and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.740
 doing this scheme but it is very 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.630
 you come here and use the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:56.100
 eximbank 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:02:00.299
 now you come here voting shift you 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.649
 and you need to move one 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.130
 vertex was only against al-shifa 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:12.410
 shift you'll be able to move 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:16.069
 a vertex just with no shift you go 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.630
 training shift 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.480
 now if you want to use everything is all 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:28.580
 that part of the top here is not all of these 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.950
 segments you come against the shift race 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.410
 all of them this Friday that comes to accelerate 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.280
 quite a lot more 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.069
 fast and making own bresh then 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.440
 that here you can too now I'm going 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.099
 simulate some situations you have here 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.430
 the record of these two here with shift 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.599
 so you create a polygon between 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.190
 these two here a great meeting out 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:00.799
 click in and drag the ac on this 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.610
 part said if you come with the shift not 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.430
 will not give 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.890
 You can greet and only then but it's too much. 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.069
 productive then you see in this bridge here 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:19.640
 in the vertex click and drag and you will 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:21.650
 building can do several times with 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.769
 shift 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.810
 if you come here picking it up one by one 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.740
 it is also a good process 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.750
 quiet 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.480
 So this is just one more personal 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.200
 here if you want to insert a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.320
 loop 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:55.390
 here you come here way not even here you see 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:58.520
 in your style and you will insert here the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.400
 Whatever you want, I already put it. 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.830
 ontario teach you you will put 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.120
 This is a shortcut, right? 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.600
 you come costs more is that here 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.600
 interface 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:22.870
 here you will tighten it is if it goes there 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.870
 I had quite a command here 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.620
 Get it right and then you put a 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.550
 robot by pressing for example s 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.870
 but then ready now whenever you 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.030
 tighten it is if you will not need it 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:53.740
 plus enter module ie ii is s 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.740
 It's your style right? 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:03.040
 ready is very easy guys and that's it 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.040
 Thank you for watching and until the next
