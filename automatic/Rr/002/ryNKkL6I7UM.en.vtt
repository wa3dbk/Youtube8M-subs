00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790 

you<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.569> see<00:03:12.720> my<00:03:12.959> boats<00:03:13.170> aren't<00:03:13.440> going<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> go

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
you can see my boats aren't going to go

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.210 
you can see my boats aren't going to go
exactly<00:03:14.550> where<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.730> shoot<00:03:14.940> them<00:03:15.560> I'm<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:17.159> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
exactly where I shoot them I'm going to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.660 
exactly where I shoot them I'm going to
go<00:03:17.340> maybe<00:03:17.760> off<00:03:17.909> to<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.120> side<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.330> little<00:03:18.390> bit

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
go maybe off to the side a little bit

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.630 
go maybe off to the side a little bit
not<00:03:20.670> very<00:03:20.849> little<00:03:21.060> split<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.330> range<00:03:21.540> though

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.380 

now<00:03:26.640> let's<00:03:27.030> try<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.269> m9<00:03:29.599> alright<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:33.090> try<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
now let's try the m9 alright so try the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.270 
now let's try the m9 alright so try the
same<00:03:33.599> thing<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.319> see<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.709> m9<00:03:38.040> my

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
same thing you can see with the m9 my

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 
same thing you can see with the m9 my
spread<00:03:38.610> just<00:03:38.849> not<00:03:39.000> increase<00:03:39.299> at<00:03:39.450> all<00:03:39.599> I'm<00:03:40.440> not

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
spread just not increase at all I'm not

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.300 
spread just not increase at all I'm not
suppressed

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.520 

and<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.599> same<00:03:47.780> when<00:03:48.050> I'm<00:03:48.170> aiming<00:03:48.440> down

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
and it's the same when I'm aiming down

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.699 
and it's the same when I'm aiming down
site<00:03:48.800> so<00:03:49.580> that's<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.540> huge<00:03:50.569> advantage<00:03:50.870> it's<00:03:51.470> a

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
site so that's a huge advantage it's a

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.940 
site so that's a huge advantage it's a
10<00:03:52.220> line<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:53.150> mp4<00:03:53.569> for<00:03:53.720> three<00:03:53.900> or<00:03:54.050> two<00:03:54.830> of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
10 line and the mp4 for three or two of

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.559 
10 line and the mp4 for three or two of
the<00:03:55.040> only<00:03:55.280> guns<00:03:55.489> in<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.849> or<00:03:56.030> weapons<00:03:56.360> in<00:03:56.480> the

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
the only guns in that or weapons in the

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.180 
the only guns in that or weapons in the
entire<00:03:56.840> game<00:03:57.050> aren't<00:03:57.380> affected<00:03:58.040> by
