let's get into the setup now I'm not
going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.650> an<00:01:31.770> unboxing<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> elgato

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
going to do an unboxing of the elgato

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
going to do an unboxing of the elgato
simply<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.630> necessary<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
simply because it's not necessary and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
simply because it's not necessary and
also<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:35.280> already<00:01:35.430> done<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.850> my

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
also because I've already done one in my

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.940 
also because I've already done one in my
review<00:01:36.210> however<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.079> will<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.439> doing<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.710> short

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

unboxing<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.820> hdmi<00:01:39.299> splitter<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
unboxing of the hdmi splitter because I

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.630 
unboxing of the hdmi splitter because I
think<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.470> might<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.680> pretty<00:01:41.009> new<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.490> most

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.470 
the ps4 coming out of the ps4 and that's
going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.860> go<00:02:52.950> into<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.640> input<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> hdmi

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
going to go into the input of the hdmi

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.839 
going to go into the input of the hdmi
splitter<00:02:54.680> let's<00:02:55.680> go<00:02:55.769> take<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> power<00:02:56.430> cable

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
splitter let's go take the power cable

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.220 
splitter let's go take the power cable
that<00:02:56.940> came<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.299> splitter<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.840> plug<00:02:58.200> that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.339 
that came with a splitter and plug that
in<00:02:58.470> as<00:02:58.590> well<00:02:59.090> next<00:03:00.090> we'll<00:03:00.209> use<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> shorter<00:03:00.900> hdmi

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
in as well next we'll use a shorter hdmi

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.050 
in as well next we'll use a shorter hdmi
cable<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.829> came<00:03:02.010> with<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.400> elgato<00:03:02.730> and

cable that came with the elgato and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.330 
cable that came with the elgato and
we'll<00:03:03.180> plug<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:03.720> end<00:03:03.750> into<00:03:04.140> one<00:03:04.650> output<00:03:04.890> of

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
we'll plug one end into one output of

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.640 
we'll plug one end into one output of
the<00:03:05.519> hdmi<00:03:05.910> splitter<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.510> other<00:03:07.110> end<00:03:07.380> into

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
exactly how to hook it up this is the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.670 
exactly how to hook it up this is the
setup<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.480> use<00:03:57.810> when<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.019> record<00:03:58.470> things

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
setup that I use when I record things

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.129 
setup that I use when I record things
and<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.010> works<00:03:59.190> great<00:03:59.359> also<00:04:00.359> I<00:04:00.389> wanted<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.930> make

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.610 
sure that there's a list of things you
can<00:04:02.730> buy<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.329> I'll<00:04:03.450> give<00:04:03.599> exact<00:04:04.049> link<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.590> that

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
can buy and I'll give exact link so that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.830 
can buy and I'll give exact link so that
way<00:04:04.829> no<00:04:05.010> one<00:04:05.040> buys<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.549> wrong<00:04:05.760> thing<00:04:06.150> because

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
way no one buys the wrong thing because

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.120 
way no one buys the wrong thing because
I<00:04:06.930> know<00:04:06.989> there's<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.319> lot<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.500> converters<00:04:08.010> out

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
I know there's a lot of converters out

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.190 
I know there's a lot of converters out
there<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.579> are<00:04:08.609> really<00:04:09.060> really<00:04:09.269> tricky<00:04:09.569> that

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
there that are really really tricky that

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.140 
there that are really really tricky that
will<00:04:10.380> degrade<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.250> quality<00:04:11.280> or<00:04:11.730> they<00:04:11.940> might

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
will degrade the quality or they might

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.539 
will degrade the quality or they might
even<00:04:12.389> go<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.049> wrong<00:04:13.200> direction<00:04:13.340> so<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.370> just

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
even go the wrong direction so I just

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.620 
even go the wrong direction so I just
want<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.760> be<00:04:14.880> sure<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.060> everyone<00:04:15.569> was

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
want to be sure that everyone was

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.270 
want to be sure that everyone was
exactly<00:04:15.959> what<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.229> do<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.950> liked<00:04:17.130> this

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
exactly what to do if you liked this
