00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
user toolbar one or zero and use a tool

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.470 
user toolbar one or zero and use a tool
/<00:05:37.950> 12<00:05:38.490> 11<00:05:38.700> you<00:05:39.330> can<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:40.620> get<00:05:40.830> create

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
/ 12 11 you can you get create

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.240 
/ 12 11 you can you get create
categories<00:05:42.480> you<00:05:43.320> can<00:05:43.500> put<00:05:43.770> them<00:05:43.920> on<00:05:44.070> different
