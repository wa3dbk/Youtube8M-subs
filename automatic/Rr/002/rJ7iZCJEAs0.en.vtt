 who said that practical car 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.030
 must look exceptionally 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.280
 utilitarian by no means even the car itself 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.650
 practical body type kompaktven 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.619
 Italians can make original and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.390
 very pretty a few years ago on 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.460
 light appeared fiat 500 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.350
 three-door hatchback made in 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 retro style machine turned out 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.630
 interesting and enjoys a huge 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.109
 popular in the market but compact 3 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.269
 the door 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.579
 it is rather a car for young or not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 burdened with family when there are three of you or 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.280
 four need a friend 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 car just for them turinsk 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.610
 automakers brought to market 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.090
 five-door compact van called 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.520
 fiat 500l 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.010
 in technical terms, this machine does not have 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.170
 nothing to do with 3 door 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.870
 style in design of course there 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.870
 but more recently 500 families 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.469
 supplemented by a new model fiat 500l 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.170
 trekking 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.390
 just such a car on our test 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.700
 now it's not even hatchback not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.210
 five-door wagon and not a minivan 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.729
 better is the crossover from the model fiat 500l 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 tracking modification is superficially distinguished 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 numerous off-road features 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.369
 for example practical but without 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.799
 unpainted plastic throughout 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.380
 the body perimeter bumpers are silvery 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.560
 original wheel inserts 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.479
 17 inch toothed rubber design 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 which this car is equipped 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.009
 directly at the factory and the very 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.799
 main increased by 15 millimeters 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.140
 ground clearance and eventually we have a car 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.509
 which outwardly with the dimensions of a compact 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.060
 car looks like an SUV 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.820
 nor did he lose the retro charm 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.060
 500 family but promises to be much 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.680
 more practical than daily trips in Ukraine 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 fiat 500l trekking 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.030
 only available with one motor but it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.119
 seems the best option 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.240
 1300 multijet turbodiesel 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.820
 85 horsepower cubes with 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.640
 this powertrain and fuel consumption 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.960
 on the highway is only 3.9 liters 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.850
 diesel on 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.140
 kilometers and even in the urban cycle 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.780
 less than five 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.580
 with such indicators on one tank of 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 Simferopol can sit cues and 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.110
 come back saves fuel in 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.880
 city helps standard for this 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.980
 system versions start and stop 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.140
 she turns off the engine when 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.750
 short stops and the very same 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.510
 starts it when you press the gas pedal 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.459
 this engine gives maximum thrust 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.440
 already at one and a half thousand revolutions 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.080
 so overclocking to the first hundred 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.030
 happens quite intensely and for 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.070
 dynamic driving is not necessary 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.830
 spin this motor to the zone 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.090
 acoustic discomfort 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.880
 the only transmission option for 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.959
 this car in our market 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.739
 robotic from 5- speed 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.100
 Transmission 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.840
 in this class it is a reasonable alternative 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.300
 classic machine weighs much 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.680
 less cheaper but at the same time 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.410
 saves fuel 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.480
 even compared with the mechanics yes this 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.830
 There is a slight delay in the box. 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.780
 gear shift 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.090
 but this if go in automatic 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.660
 mode if there is a need for better 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.760
 speakers 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.590
 enable manual mode with 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.510
 transfer in it can be switched as 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.970
 floor handle and steering column 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.090
 petals and notice it standard 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.090
 equipment 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.489
 Italians are very proud to be among 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.290
 compact crossovers and the same 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.690
 compact warriors they managed to do 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.209
 the car is the most spacious body and 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.250
 it seems to be hard to expect from 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.350
 car length of 4 meters 20 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.870
 centimeters more spacious cabin 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.480
 for example, you can easily put it here 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.610
 length in 2 meters 40 centimeters everywhere 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.829
 folding not only the rear seats but 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.560
 and the back of the front trunk itself 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.609
 400 liters large enough with 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.430
 very rich in possibilities 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.709
 transformation of the cargo hold here 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.120
 actually a three-story shelf you can 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.239
 rearrange by a few centimeters 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.920
 hid higher or lower dokatka 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.350
 and the minimum set of road 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.450
 Instrument rear seats of course 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.370
 fold and hold in such 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.950
 position automatically by 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.750
 shock absorbers by the way in the rear seats 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.739
 you can separately adjust the angle 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.019
 backrest tilt 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.010
 and these rear seats can be moved 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.110
 back and forth 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.110
 making larger or smaller trunk

 interior fiat 500l trekking 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.800
 influence the driver as well as the connoisseur

 aged cognac 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.150
 it's time to talk about the firm aftertaste on 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.400
 actually this crossover 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.170
 very high quality interior decent

 growth and build front seats even 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.570
 The base is equipped with heating and adjustment 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.060
 lumbar support gray fabric upholstered 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.060
 successfully complemented by brown leather 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.370
 leather inlays of the same color on the maps 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.100
 doors and even on the outer steering abad and 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.090
 everything in this cabin is not just made of 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.220
 expensive materials 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.320
 and done correctly all the buttons are 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.240
 where you expect them to meet and 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.010
 apply to them properly 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.850
 efforts in general with regard to 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.640
 the interior 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.650
 this kind of real premium is the same as in 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.130
 the level of picking rain sensors and 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.750

 climate control and multimedia system 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.110
 with a large color computer monitor 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.780
 all this is already present in the base 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.330
 picking fiat 500l trekking 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.550
 there is a lot of space throughout the cabin 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.250
 storage a variety of luggage 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.620
 even the glove box is two and the upper one with 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.110
 cooling and in general the salon itself is very 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.190
 spacious and it is possible that the most 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.430
 big in this class 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.560
 fiat 500l trekking certainly not frame 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.610
 SUV and drive here only on 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.950
 front wheels 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.050
 but nonetheless he has more toothy 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.690
 rubber and increased ground clearance 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.670
 In addition to the standard ATP assistant when 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.890
 start on the rise is advanced 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.140
 attraction system plus it turns on 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.720
 pushing a button located on the tunnel 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.160
 between the seats next to the button which 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.710
 economy mode activated 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.200
 gear shift so here is truction 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.840
 plus works at speeds up to 30 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.880
 kilometers an hour and quite successfully replaces 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.580
 cross-axle differential lock 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.620
 if an ordinary passenger car with 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.449
 wheel slip just don't see 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.460
 voice from the seat for example on slippery 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.250
 the rise is such a situation 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.530
 will correct the traction system plus it does not 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.350
 just slow down the wheel slip is not 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.389
 will give torque to that wheel y 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.729
 which is better grip 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.520
 we checked this system on ice 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:38.190
 Does it generally slippery ground 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.190
 the road is too tough for this car 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.930
 know when to stop by this feat Russian tradition 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.330
 the machine has two modes of operation of the amplifier 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.400
 steering when you press the city button 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.860
 the steering wheel becomes almost weightless 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.320
 This mode is useful in the city and especially 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.900
 when maneuvering in the parking lot anyway 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.360
 this feat is always confidently controlled 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.520
 realizing that under the wheels on high 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.979
 speed has a little steer 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.690
 but everything is within the normal range for such 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.760
 high car by the way 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.590
 fog lights extra 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.720
 lights turn on when turning left 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.590
 or right to see better 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.750
 turn and so fiat 500l trekking 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.699
 This is an example of how a car with 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.979
 original appearance can be 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.599
 practical he has a decent road 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:22.410
 clearance and playful and economical diesel 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:24.770
 engine 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.820
 large trunk and plenty of space in the cabin 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.260
 quality finishing materials and 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.599
 rich equipment 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.700
 and all this for two hundred and fourteen thousand 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.919
 hryvnia is a good family option 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.720
 car for which they say not only 

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.720
 calculator but also emotions
