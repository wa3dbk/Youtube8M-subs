00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.340
 let's prepare sausages to wine in 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.280
 pot express the ingredients that 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.429
 we need are for 2 or 3 people 8 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.910
 fresh sausages an onion 100 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.490
 milliliters of white wine oil salt and 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.429
 pepper and the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.920
 is going to be chopping our onion in the 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.679
 format that we like in this case 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.320
 we decided to chop it in juliana 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.720
 to give a sausage appearance 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.520
 encebollada in the final result but 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.950
 if we want we can cut it into pieces 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 thicker since in the express pot it 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.290
 will cook very easily 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.270
 then we cut the sausages with 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.580
 the help of scissors because to be 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.100
 fresh sausage if we did it with the 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.880
 knife probably we were 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.710
 would destroy and they would undo us once 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.630
 we have them cut in the bottom of 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.330
 our pot we add a couple of 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.380
 tablespoons of oil we heat and 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:06.750
 put the onions over high heat the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.750
 we sautÃ© quickly with a little salt 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.220
 until we see that all of it starts to 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 sweat and is wet with the oil 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.290
 then we will add the sausage 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.610
 between the previous step and the throwing 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
 sausage will not have happened practically 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.840
 not a minute is a very fast recipe 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.479
 we move them until they acquire a color 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.479
 whitish we add the wine 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.479
 we let the alcohol evaporate 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.619
 and then we put a little salt 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.619
 and pepper 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.370
 and we'll close the pot when it goes up 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 maximum power we will have the rings 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.659
 just 5 minutes and past those 5 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.100
 minutes 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.860
 we will let him lose steam alone 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.689
 once we can open the beige pot that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.020
 the sausage has been perfectly 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.780
 cooked the onion is soft and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.520
 has a very nice sauce if 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 we want this sauce to have a little 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.510
 more than consistency we can always 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.489
 add a little cornstarch one 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.130
 little bit of breadcrumbs or just 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.440
 reducing it to a boil and ready and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.310
 we have our sausages to wine in 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.340
 express pot that are very juicy very 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.040
 soft and as you can see they are super easy 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.650
 and super fast to do I can 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.650
 ensure that they are delicious
