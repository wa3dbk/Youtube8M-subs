into my backward contra check I'm not
going<00:03:07.270> too<00:03:07.390> low<00:03:07.570> because<00:03:07.810> we're<00:03:08.080> keeping<00:03:08.350> this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
going too low because we're keeping this

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.140 
going too low because we're keeping this
all<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.950> toes<00:03:09.250> because<00:03:09.550> of<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.940> quick

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
all on the toes because of the quick

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.080 
all on the toes because of the quick
step<00:03:10.510> lightness<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.680> brightness<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.850> am

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
step lightness and brightness but I am

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.850 
step lightness and brightness but I am
going<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.480> rotate<00:03:13.660> strongly<00:03:14.470> through<00:03:14.680> my

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860
