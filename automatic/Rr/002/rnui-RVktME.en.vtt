00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.620
A taxi driver who was at Goreme Open Air Museum

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.740
told me to go to a Turkish carpet school and he

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.000
led me to the school on his way to home. 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.380
I followed his taxi. But I was actually quite suspicious

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.360
if he would tell me to pay guide fee...

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.760
but he just led me to the place and left. 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.400
I always keep myself to be suspicious during solo trip.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.960
Well, I've left the carpet school and on the way to 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.780
Paşabağ.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.080
Here is strangely shaped rock area at Paşabağ.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.200
I'm surrounded by the rocks. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.900
I always take thousands of photos when I amazed a place.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.940
But I know I'm going to say all these look same !

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.740
This is the car I'm renting, 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.760
You don't see any dirt at a glance but it's very dirty !

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.760
covered in mad and sand both the inside and the outside... :(

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.640
Next stop, I parked the car and

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.820
going for ramble in Goreme town...

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.220
Aren't you familiar with this logo...?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.360
Doesn't look like McDonald's ?!

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.460
I wanted to go to somewhere local cafe...

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.860
but I saw only men were in the cafe... over 30 men were there.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.420
I should go to somewhere else...

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.280
Look at this !

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.740
I thought the horse is fake, but it's real !

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.440
There are many dogs (no lead) in the town.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.900
I'm scared of them although I like dogs because

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040
the dogs are big and shepherd looking.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.800
Oh, it's the last day of the year today. 　

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.020
Here is quite quiet because it's the last day of the year ?!

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.540
I came to a cafe. Going to have snack instead of lunch.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.500
because I have big dinner tonight.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.400
They have wifi, nice !

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600
It's already at 2:30 pm. 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.940
Let's have a small snack !

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.040
Wow !! I expected smaller !!

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.780
This is ''Meze''. Meme means appetizer.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.540
I think it's very healthy because these are all vegetable.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800
?? what's this ??

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.060
Mint.... ?    Tomate... ? and pasta ? 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.200
I still have a jet lag and not really having appetite in this few days.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.540
I might loose my weight in Turkey ??

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.320
I wonder where I parked my car... but 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.900
I found it easily because nobody park their cars

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.020
front forward...

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.060
Here is Rose Valley. Famous for rock's color at the sunset time.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.300
but I don't see anybody else here now and 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.840
I'm not sure if here is the right location... 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.900
I'm taking opposite side of Rose Valley now... sunset shooting.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.540
Oh, the camera setting was something wrong :(

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.800
OK, I try again !

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.960
I take Rose Valley now. 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.080
This is the area of my hotel located. Uchisar. 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.640
The lights are gorgeous, isn't it ?

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.580
The light colors changes every 20-30 seconds. 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.820
Now, it's a gala dinner time !

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.540
they have live Turkish music and performance. 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.080
I shared a table with a lady 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.120
who is a traveller from Brazil.
