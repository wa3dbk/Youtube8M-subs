00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
when you should actually be shifting

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.780 
when you should actually be shifting
which<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.820> kind<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.090> cool<00:02:59.150> too<00:02:59.540> but<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.670> mean<00:03:01.670> you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
which is kind of cool too but I mean you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.220 
which is kind of cool too but I mean you
drive<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> car<00:03:02.150> for<00:03:02.450> ten<00:03:02.630> minutes<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.110> you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
drive the car for ten minutes and you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.790 
drive the car for ten minutes and you
kind<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:04.120> what<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.390> really

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.670 

but<00:03:12.340> there's<00:03:12.520> definitely<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.600> lot<00:03:14.080> more<00:03:14.320> torque

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
but there's definitely a lot more torque

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.740 
but there's definitely a lot more torque
than<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.850> last<00:03:16.030> ones<00:03:16.240> I<00:03:16.330> mean<00:03:16.450> this<00:03:16.540> thing

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
than the last ones I mean this thing

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.310 
than the last ones I mean this thing
gets<00:03:16.960> off<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.320> line<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:19.150> quicker<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:22.320> goes

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
gets off the line much quicker and goes

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.940 
gets off the line much quicker and goes
a<00:03:23.350> lot<00:03:23.620> better<00:03:23.770> through<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.160> gears<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:25.950> think

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
a lot better through the gears I think

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.110 
a lot better through the gears I think
the<00:03:27.040> redline<00:03:27.400> shorter<00:03:27.790> but<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.090> just

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the redline shorter but that just

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.720 
the redline shorter but that just
happens<00:03:28.570> when<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.810> get<00:03:28.930> bigger<00:03:29.140> engines<00:03:29.620> and

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.589 

change<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.940> gearing<00:03:35.239> in<00:03:35.450> these<00:03:37.299> dashes<00:03:38.299> done

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
change the gearing in these dashes done

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.369 
change the gearing in these dashes done
up<00:03:38.720> really<00:03:38.900> cool<00:03:39.140> like<00:03:39.349> this<00:03:39.530> carbon<00:03:40.190> fiber

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
up really cool like this carbon fiber

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.860 
up really cool like this carbon fiber
looking<00:03:42.379> panel<00:03:42.799> all<00:03:43.010> around<00:03:43.580> even<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.599> seats

looking panel all around even the seats

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.530 
looking panel all around even the seats
almost<00:03:45.260> look<00:03:45.409> like<00:03:45.440> they<00:03:45.709> have<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:46.540> carbon

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
almost look like they have a carbon

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.440 
almost look like they have a carbon
fiber<00:03:47.830> look<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:49.010> them<00:03:49.220> which<00:03:49.909> is<00:03:50.030> really<00:03:50.239> cool

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
fiber look to them which is really cool

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.030 
fiber look to them which is really cool
comfortable<00:03:51.110> you're<00:03:51.349> in<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> seats<00:03:51.799> that's

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
comfortable you're in the seats that's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.420 
comfortable you're in the seats that's
for<00:03:52.190> sure<00:03:52.340> nice<00:03:52.849> bucket<00:03:53.120> seats<00:03:54.250> keeping<00:03:55.250> even

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
for sure nice bucket seats keeping even

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.289 
for sure nice bucket seats keeping even
a<00:03:55.489> big<00:03:55.670> old<00:03:55.819> boy<00:03:55.970> like<00:03:56.150> me<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.450> them<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:59.150> got

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
a big old boy like me in them you got

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.550 
a big old boy like me in them you got
your<00:03:59.450> exhilarating<00:03:59.900> ports<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.260> everything

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560

like<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.709> for<00:04:01.159> stereo<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.790> know<00:04:02.180> there's<00:04:02.480> a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
like that for stereo I know there's a

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.059 
like that for stereo I know there's a
massive<00:04:02.810> sound<00:04:03.170> system<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.709> thing<00:04:03.920> it's

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
massive sound system in this thing it's

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.430 
massive sound system in this thing it's
like<00:04:04.129> three<00:04:04.310> hundred<00:04:04.400> sixty<00:04:04.670> watts<00:04:05.030> which<00:04:05.239> is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
like three hundred sixty watts which is

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.720 
like three hundred sixty watts which is
really<00:04:06.440> really<00:04:06.620> cool<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:09.459> mean<00:04:10.459> this<00:04:10.549> thing

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
really really cool I mean this thing

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.030 
really really cool I mean this thing
just<00:04:10.879> like<00:04:11.090> screen<00:04:11.930> like<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.379> wants<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.590> go<00:04:12.709> I

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
just like screen like it wants to go I

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.729 
just like screen like it wants to go I
mean<00:04:13.250> seriously<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:13.819> almost<00:04:14.319> hard<00:04:15.319> like<00:04:15.590> we

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
mean seriously it's almost hard like we

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.800 
mean seriously it's almost hard like we
just<00:04:15.890> found<00:04:16.039> out<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.579> do<00:04:16.699> the<00:04:16.789> speed<00:04:17.030> limit

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
just found out to do the speed limit

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.580 
just found out to do the speed limit
sometimes<00:04:18.320> especially<00:04:19.250> not<00:04:19.789> 30<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.590> don't

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
sometimes especially not 30 I don't

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.570 
sometimes especially not 30 I don't
think<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.769> car<00:04:22.010> game<00:04:22.190> goes<00:04:22.370> 30<00:04:24.460> it's<00:04:25.460> either

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
think this car game goes 30 it's either

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.140 
think this car game goes 30 it's either
0<00:04:25.940> or<00:04:26.030> 35<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.990> set<00:04:27.169> that's<00:04:27.350> where<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.560> starts

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
0 or 35 and set that's where it starts

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.180 
0 or 35 and set that's where it starts
I<00:04:29.240> mean<00:04:29.900> getting<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.230> on<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.380> pedal<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.010> that

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
I mean getting it on the pedal and that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:40.670 
I mean getting it on the pedal and that
just<00:04:31.510> kicks<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.750> nice

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.230 

very<00:04:41.340> easy<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.729> pass<00:04:41.910> somebody<00:04:44.120> they're<00:04:45.120> not

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
very easy to pass somebody they're not

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.830 
very easy to pass somebody they're not
quite<00:04:45.509> going<00:04:45.630> as<00:04:46.440> quick<00:04:46.710> as<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.919> want<00:04:47.100> them<00:04:47.190> to
