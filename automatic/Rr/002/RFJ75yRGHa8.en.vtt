00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.509
 good afternoon my favorite viewers are glad 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.550
 greet you on your channel and 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:31.269
 today i want to tell you about 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:35.350
 interesting cosmetics sang cosmetic this 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:40.489
 Ukrainian cosmetics and I test it 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.239
 together 2 probably and let's start with the cream 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.170
 for eyes 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.850
 eyes in mass is a mirror of the soul if u 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:54.440
 us eyes glisten skin under eyes not 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:58.160
 dry is normal then everything is fine we 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.190
 feel so confident this such 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.330
 cream I have as you can see it already 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.429
 very little left I would test and 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.270
 I'll tell you right away regularly 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:14.860
 enjoy practically in the morning and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:20.500
 in the evening this is what we imagine 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.690
 such a cream is pretty pretty so thick and 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.080
 I will immediately say that there are a lot of active 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:32.360
 chest and it needs quite a bit 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.509
 and what I noticed when using this 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.310
 cream if they use regularly 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.160
 so absences the case then first to the new 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.860
 all cleaned up 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.810
 circles under the eyes more or less become 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.110
 not so invisible about 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.380
 cleaned wrinkles i can't say that 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.770
 I'm certainly not for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.860
 this and generally my main demand 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.840
 probably the cream was such that I need 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.509
 so that the skin was under the eyes 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.479
 well moisturized cream here this feature 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.450
 perform almost 100 percent 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:18.569
 before the skin moisturizes very well 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 dark circles a little about wrinkles not 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.470
 noticed and plus all the same 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.080
 in the morning if you used it for the night 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.489
 in the morning you get up you have no a 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.480
 ate from puffiness of eyes that is normal 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:41.130
 all good eyes shine following this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.860
 Me such a cream this lifting cream with 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.180
 botox effect who does not know what is 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.579
 here so probably such and there is no botox at 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.099
 wrinkles relax us and here 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:57.120
 here here is so unique 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:00.660
 so-called peptide which helps 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.579
 relax on mimic wrinkles immediately 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.560
 smells say they are and that's 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.770
 probably neutral here at all 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.680
 products such soon 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.850
 such a plant smell is not chemical but 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.870
 Here is such a floral smell and 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.570
 regular use of appointments 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.930
 cream clean up such mimic wrinkles 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.320
 which we have in the process 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.370
 the process of our life and if you will 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.200
 regularly use at all like 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.020
 the manufacturer guarantees 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 that mimic wrinkles will decrease 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.040
 and companies will appear new and 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.170
 the main regularity I understand that 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.690
 In general, according to my feelings you probably need 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.420
 enjoy constantly I take breaks 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.230
 I use something that I use 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.750
 break and switch to another tool 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.170
 after applying the skin of course yes you can see 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.760
 that she was fresh rested about 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.010
 wrinkles, I also did not notice one need 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.630
 need regularly 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.790
 so if you are interested then 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:25.750
 look closely here and so it looks and 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:28.420
 You are such a package for the next three 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.350
 the tool is probably still heavy 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.900
 a weapon like this 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.640
 remedies is botox serum with effect 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.020
 reduction of mimic wrinkles in the area 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.689
 forehead 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.509
 if you have them 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:51.629
 very well expressed up to 52 percent 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.519
 such a remedy is very serious 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.319
 probably apply when you really 

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:58.469
 such serious problems and 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:02.369
 is a here is such that 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:07.699
 there you take a little bit and put on 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:09.589
 face let's say this is a consequence of this replacement 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.799
 botox 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:15.689
 someone else injects someone 

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:18.719
 apply if you are not so pronounced and 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.789
 you want to remove your mimic 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.639
 wrinkles then you can use here 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.719
 I’ll tell you right now that I haven’t yet 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.009

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:31.769
 effect effect I can not say but who 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.860
 who has such problems who does not want 

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:38.069
 do injections then look at here to 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.379
 this means also with this one can 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.909
 take advantage to take advantage after 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:47.849
 how you did for example 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:49.829
 oil and after injection can 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.979
 take advantage of that is constantly 

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:55.229
 use this means the following 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.529
 the tool is also very interesting 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:03.059
 means this is dough which 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.399

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:09.839
