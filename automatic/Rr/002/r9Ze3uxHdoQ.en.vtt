00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.690
 Gerasimov 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.100
 according to bidding 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.000
 in 2002 m 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.329
 taking as their basis virtually none 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.049
 tournament thanks 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.159
 by the way alexey 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.980
 the director is all a mess 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 great-grandchildren watching companies 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 in the company of loved ones 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.939
 but for now about the humble 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.239
 attention to design 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.910
 on the sides of the shipbuilding 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.900
 after the launch ceremony is resting 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.550
 and I am an athlete all the same r 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.679
 Unfortunately 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.679
 looked not sideways 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
 all comers can 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.040
 honestly i'm looking down 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.970
 of course there was something there 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.240
 not a drug 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.580
 best form in stock 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.020
 Well, so that people 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.770
 say to whom whatever place for 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 builds cannot 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.600
 so let's get revenge 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 I could not look in front 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.659
 everything was great 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:11.650
 but in vain 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.760
 so 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 Codex Alexey Shabunin all 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.870
 nice that he 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.550
 the last was designated 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.690
 problem strizhment them simply did not 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.660
 alien dinosaur die 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.790
 it's from hand 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.610
 percent need a professional 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.240
 and we will only see st 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.710
 over the past five years 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.390
 see once 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.700
 OK 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.850
 but what if 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.660
 m 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.910
 stay try not to think 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.980
 I did not interfere turned out to be very modest 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.270
 first he flew in 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 four 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 microsoft promised 3 8 what's the difference 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.450
 if will be located or and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.630
 both 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.759
 at cost can look closed 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.110
 Year Era on it arbitrary 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.339
 the program 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.469
 for someone there is no 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:11.449
 and this is achieved
