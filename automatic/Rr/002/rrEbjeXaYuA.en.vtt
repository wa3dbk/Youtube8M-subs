00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.610 

the<00:00:04.600> first<00:00:04.810> pattern<00:00:05.050> that<00:00:05.260> I'll<00:00:05.380> show<00:00:05.560> you

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:05.620 
the first pattern that I'll show you

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.080 
the first pattern that I'll show you
will<00:00:06.430> use<00:00:06.670> this<00:00:07.000> e<00:00:07.240> 7th<00:00:07.809> position<00:00:08.790> up<00:00:09.790> on<00:00:10.030> the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
will use this e 7th position up on the

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.860 
will use this e 7th position up on the
fifth<00:00:10.330> fret<00:00:10.990> so<00:00:11.260> that's<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:13.180> third<00:00:13.450> of<00:00:13.720> those

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
fifth fret so that's the third of those

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.099 
fifth fret so that's the third of those
seventh<00:00:14.410> chords<00:00:14.740> that<00:00:14.860> we<00:00:14.950> showed<00:00:15.160> you<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.630> not

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
seventh chords that we showed you so not

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.680 
seventh chords that we showed you so not
this<00:00:17.289> one<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:18.189> on<00:00:18.519> this<00:00:18.670> one<00:00:18.849> but<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.300> very

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
this one and on this one but the very

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.320 
this one and on this one but the very
third<00:00:19.900> one<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:22.140> we'll<00:00:23.140> start<00:00:23.470> with<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
third one and we'll start with the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.730 
third one and we'll start with the
backwards<00:00:26.110> roll

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
backwards roll

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.290 
backwards roll
so<00:00:28.550> we'll<00:00:28.699> do<00:00:28.820> two<00:00:29.090> backwards<00:00:29.570> roles

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.160 

and<00:00:34.700> starting<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.240> first<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.870> we're<00:00:37.050> going

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and starting the first one we're going

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.430 
and starting the first one we're going
to<00:00:37.430> plug<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.640> six<00:00:39.090> string<00:00:39.360> together<00:00:39.540> with

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
to plug this six string together with

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.330 
to plug this six string together with
the<00:00:40.530> first<00:00:40.740> string<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.530> then<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.739> fourth

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the first string and then the fourth

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
the first string and then the fourth
string<00:00:44.640> together<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> index

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
string together when we get to the index

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.740 
string together when we get to the index
finger<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.890> that'll<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.420> six<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.540> one

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
finger so that'll be six and one

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.640 
finger so that'll be six and one
together<00:00:48.900> two<00:00:50.750> four<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.930> three<00:00:52.140> together<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
together two four and three together the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.690 
together two four and three together the
two<00:00:52.830> middle<00:00:53.129> ones<00:00:53.160> together<00:00:55.400> you<00:00:56.400> have<00:00:56.550> that

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
two middle ones together you have that

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.280 
two middle ones together you have that
little<00:00:56.850> move<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:58.220> then<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.629> first<00:01:00.900> string

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
little move and then the first string

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.170 
little move and then the first string
plays<00:01:01.590> by<00:01:01.830> itself<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.670> then<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> sixth

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
plays by itself and then the sixth

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
plays by itself and then the sixth
string<00:01:06.360> follows<00:01:06.840> after<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> second<00:01:07.979> time

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
string follows after so the second time

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
string follows after so the second time
we<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.270> together<00:01:09.630> first<00:01:10.050> time<00:01:10.259> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
we do it it's not together first time is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830 
we do it it's not together first time is
together<00:01:11.630> second<00:01:12.630> time

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
together second time

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.039 
together second time
ring<00:01:14.560> finger<00:01:14.770> first<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.340> then<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.610> thumb

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
ring finger first and then the thumb

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.550 
ring finger first and then the thumb
then<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.259> middle<00:01:17.590> finger<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:20.170> middle

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
then the middle finger and two middle

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.380 
then the middle finger and two middle
ones<00:01:20.590> together<00:01:21.189> again<00:01:21.610> so<00:01:21.909> four<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.240> three

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
ones together again so four and three

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.660 
ones together again so four and three
together<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.890> here<00:01:24.189> we'll<00:01:24.310> do<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.549> whole

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
together so here we'll do the whole

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.460 
together so here we'll do the whole
thing<00:01:24.729> starting<00:01:25.479> with<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> pluck<00:01:25.990> at<00:01:26.320> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
thing starting with a pluck at the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.990 
thing starting with a pluck at the
beginning<00:01:27.270> middle<00:01:28.270> ones<00:01:28.630> first<00:01:29.530> string

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
beginning middle ones first string

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.149 
beginning middle ones first string
little<00:01:31.660> ones

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:51.929 

with<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.030> muffled<00:01:40.420> bass

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.109 

here's<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.630> cool<00:01:52.840> move<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.369> what<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:57.579> did<00:01:57.700> there

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
here's a cool move so what I did there

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.090 
here's a cool move so what I did there
is<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:58.420> took<00:01:58.840> all<00:01:59.110> my<00:01:59.320> fingers<00:01:59.619> and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
is I just took all my fingers and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.639 
is I just took all my fingers and
scooted<00:02:00.880> them<00:02:00.970> down<00:02:01.149> one<00:02:01.450> fret<00:02:01.780> except<00:02:02.320> for

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
scooted them down one fret except for

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.069 
scooted them down one fret except for
that<00:02:02.829> first<00:02:03.220> finger<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.270> just<00:02:04.509> left<00:02:04.689> it<00:02:04.899> there

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
that first finger I just left it there

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.370 
that first finger I just left it there
and<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.969> turns<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.630> into<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.899> diminished

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
and that turns that into a diminished

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.680 
and that turns that into a diminished
chord

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.990 

so<00:02:11.590> that's<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.610> beginning<00:02:12.760> of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so that's just like the beginning of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.380 
so that's just like the beginning of
deep<00:02:13.240> river<00:02:13.510> blues<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:14.050> does<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:15.390> slide

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
deep river blues it does it slide

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.270 
deep river blues it does it slide
everything<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.050> first<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.690> back<00:02:19.900> of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.390 

if<00:02:24.330> you're<00:02:25.330> comfortable<00:02:25.569> with<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
if you're comfortable with the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.559 
if you're comfortable with the
diminished<00:02:27.790> chord<00:02:27.849> you<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.300> switch

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
diminished chord you can switch

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.140 
diminished chord you can switch
positions<00:02:29.260> with<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:29.920> two<00:02:30.130> fingers<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
positions with these two fingers the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.729 
positions with these two fingers the
same<00:02:31.180> notes

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.250 

either<00:02:35.739> way<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:35.980> fine
