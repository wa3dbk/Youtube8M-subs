 Hi, I am what I will have or I am a consultant 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.590
 of entrepreneurship today I want them 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.620
 share a bit of entrepreneurship 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.870
 social and rural if you have an idea with 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 what do you want to change the world with what 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.130
 you want to make a difference in life 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.010
 of many people and that you want to go to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 field and face the challenges that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.130
 there is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 first it is very important that you focus 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.000
 in one thing that you focus on a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.640
 only need and that goes from your 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.379
 entrepreneurship in this you have clear which 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.750
 is the solution that you are going to offer now 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.170
 who are you going to offer him the kiel and the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.440
 for whom based on a need for 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.870
 real that for example if you work with 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390
 farmers with farmers with 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.129
 ranchers a need for ranchers 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.519
 it may be that if I want to buy 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.829
 won I have to go to an auction and that 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.260
 It takes me a lot of time and a lot of effort and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.230
 then you will investigate how real it is 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.899
 this need how it works how many 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.910
 ranchers is that they travel to auctions and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.550
 how is it that they travel and handle everything 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.970
 that theme of buying just like other 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.220
 needs also touches to investigate 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.070
 how real is that need and based 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.500
 in that you define what you are going to do 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.149
 and who is working on what basis 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 the time you have to keep in mind that 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.909
 many times people are very 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 geographically dispersed many times 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.400
 you can find is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.130
 people in guilds in associations 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.130
 Conduct meetings look for all 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.010
 places where these people meet 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.410
 to be able to do your validation of how 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.740
 is that this need works and looks 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.619
 identify influencers people 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.200
 they really have many contacts in 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.850
 the paths that have many contacts 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 many friends among them 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.100
 peasants and who have a 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.950
 influence many times you have to have in 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.200
 tell if you really go to the sidewalks 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.100
 if you go to people what we call base 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 of pyramid the people that are are 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.730
 many but they are usually very 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 little connected 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.989
 you have to keep in mind that you are 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.850
 people that many times their education is 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.370
 very basic you can find for 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.980
 example with 'the illiterate with people 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.200
 they do not know how to handle technology and you go 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.630
 to have to adjust your model of 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.239
 business needs them 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.569
 try to make things very visual not 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.920
 with small letters tiny buttons 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.530
 options but very visual and very simple 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.579
 so that these people can take advantage of 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.280
 what you offer them humble you listen 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.530
 to these people and treat them with their 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.840
 needs that are very important that 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.239
 they are very big in their lives and 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.750
 seeks to understand in what world they live 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.530
 how this need works and through 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.840
 of that you will look for better solutions 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.879
 better options for them you are going to enter 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.980
 in the market with a product that is 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.769
 much better and that really can do 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.049
 an impact can make a difference in 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.689
 the lives of these people a very good 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.180
 example of a rural enterprise is 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.620
 I buy agro where they play boyacÃ¡ 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.719
 onion growers have interviewed 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.629
 your group of people around and have 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.730
 designed something that is very simple to 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.609
 that those who grow onions can 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.879
 offer your harvest in a very 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.609
 easy and you will reach the market better than it is 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.200
 a very big advantage for them because 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.910
 can be removed as 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.940
 many intermediaries in the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.830
 market then they stay with a silver 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.980
 which is much larger for the harvest 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.750
 of what was before 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.790
 then if you have an idea with what 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.980
 you want to change the world with what you want 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.220
 really face the challenges of 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.680
 field you want to repopulate the field look 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.010
 the entrepreneurs that are looking for 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.099
 example buy agro writes badly twitter 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.200
 also and it makes more than everything 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.299
 validation looks for a lot of information in 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.500
 regarding entrepreneurship and find 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.430
 many potential users 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.430
 beneficiaries or clients
