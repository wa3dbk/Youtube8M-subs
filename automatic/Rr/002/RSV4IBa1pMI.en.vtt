00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
for a while but what really jumps out at

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.880 
for a while but what really jumps out at
me<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.430> music<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.479> menus<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:13.890> forgot

I love the simple menus and the music is
terrific<00:01:22.179> I<00:01:22.509> wish<00:01:22.810> they<00:01:22.990> were<00:01:23.050> still<00:01:23.140> using<00:01:23.470> it

terrific I wish they were still using it

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.870 
terrific I wish they were still using it
it<00:01:26.229> brings<00:01:26.470> back<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> lot<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:27.039> memories<00:01:27.460> effect

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
it brings back a lot of memories effect

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.270 
it brings back a lot of memories effect
the<00:01:28.000> only<00:01:28.119> game<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.470> think<00:01:29.500> I've<00:01:29.890> played

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
the only game that I think I've played

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.850 
the only game that I think I've played
more<00:01:30.670> than<00:01:30.909> Gran<00:01:31.270> Turismo<00:01:31.509> one<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.200> Gran

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
more than Gran Turismo one is Gran

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.890 
more than Gran Turismo one is Gran
Turismo<00:01:33.100> 2

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.140 

I<00:01:40.990> picked<00:01:41.350> up<00:01:41.500> this<00:01:41.650> game<00:01:41.860> in<00:01:42.010> 1998<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:42.970> can

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
I picked up this game in 1998 and I can

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.840 
I picked up this game in 1998 and I can
safely<00:01:43.330> say<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.900> changed<00:01:44.290> my<00:01:44.470> life<00:01:44.610> maybe<00:01:45.610> not

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
safely say it changed my life maybe not

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.550 
safely say it changed my life maybe not
as<00:01:45.970> much<00:01:46.180> as<00:01:46.360> like<00:01:46.690> some<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.290> know<00:01:47.350> more

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
as much as like some you know more

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.280 
as much as like some you know more
important<00:01:47.980> things<00:01:48.250> but<00:01:51.900> this<00:01:52.900> certainly

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
important things but this certainly

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.590 
important things but this certainly
changed<00:01:53.770> my<00:01:53.830> perspective<00:01:54.220> on<00:01:54.700> driving<00:01:55.330> games

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
changed my perspective on driving games

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.830 
changed my perspective on driving games
and<00:01:55.930> took<00:01:56.530> me<00:01:56.710> from<00:01:57.070> games<00:01:57.640> like<00:01:57.790> outrun<00:01:58.510> which

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
and took me from games like outrun which

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.900 
and took me from games like outrun which
I<00:01:58.990> still<00:01:59.170> love<00:01:59.410> but<00:02:00.070> took<00:02:00.250> me<00:02:00.400> from<00:02:00.520> games<00:02:00.790> like

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
I still love but took me from games like

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.600 
I still love but took me from games like
outrun<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:02.020> Gran<00:02:02.320> Turismo<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:05.610> whole

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
spending a bit of time with this game I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
spending a bit of time with this game I
actually<00:02:26.140> kind<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.740> missed<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.160> simplicity

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
actually kind of missed the simplicity

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.840 
actually kind of missed the simplicity
of<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.900> earlier<00:02:29.260> games<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.920> still<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.700> my

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
of the earlier games I still have my

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.940 
of the earlier games I still have my
memory<00:02:31.240> card<00:02:31.450> for<00:02:31.750> Gran<00:02:32.020> Turismo<00:02:32.230> 2<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:32.920> I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
memory card for Gran Turismo 2 but I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.220 
memory card for Gran Turismo 2 but I
have<00:02:33.160> no<00:02:33.310> idea<00:02:33.340> for<00:02:34.060> my<00:02:34.209> save<00:02:34.420> game<00:02:34.450> file<00:02:34.959> for

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.530 
have no idea for my save game file for
Gran<00:02:35.440> Turismo<00:02:35.680> 1<00:02:36.130> went<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.970> actually<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.330> think

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
Gran Turismo 1 went and actually I think

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.970 
Gran Turismo 1 went and actually I think
that's<00:02:37.690> more<00:02:37.840> appropriate<00:02:38.110> for<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.650> review

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that's more appropriate for this review

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.800 
that's more appropriate for this review
because<00:02:39.310> I've<00:02:39.880> talked<00:02:40.150> about<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.600> game

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
because I've talked about the game

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.650 
because I've talked about the game
playing<00:02:41.140> Gran<00:02:41.470> Turismo<00:02:41.910> numerous<00:02:42.910> times<00:02:43.270> and

times in various reviews although the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.590 
times in various reviews although the
driving<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.730> good<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.150> game<00:02:49.360> it's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
driving is good in this game it's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.140 
driving is good in this game it's
nowhere<00:02:49.840> near<00:02:50.019> what<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:51.430> becomes<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.910> Gran

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
nowhere near what it becomes in Gran

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.890 
nowhere near what it becomes in Gran
Turismo<00:02:52.390> 4<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:53.290> GT<00:02:53.769> 5<00:02:54.010> prologue<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.750> one

Turismo 4 or GT 5 prologue this is one

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.870 
Turismo 4 or GT 5 prologue this is one
of<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.080> first<00:02:56.340> PlayStation<00:02:57.340> games<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.760> use

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
of the first PlayStation games to use

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.130 
of the first PlayStation games to use
the<00:02:58.000> analog<00:02:58.390> controls<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:58.959> I'd<00:02:59.019> actually

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
the analog controls and I'd actually

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.110 
the analog controls and I'd actually
forgotten<00:02:59.620> all<00:02:59.739> about<00:02:59.769> that<00:03:00.250> because<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.940> don't

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
forgotten all about that because I don't

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240 
forgotten all about that because I don't

I recommend Gran Turismo 2 I think they
