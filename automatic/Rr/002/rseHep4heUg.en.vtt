today I'm just showing a leak finder of
a<00:00:07.080> long-term<00:00:07.290> student<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.859> mine<00:00:08.010> now<00:00:08.130> he's

long way so today we're just doing a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.710 
long way so today we're just doing a
link<00:00:16.260> finder<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.859> see<00:00:17.180> what<00:00:18.180> more<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.420> can

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
link finder just to see what more we can

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.290 
link finder just to see what more we can
find<00:00:19.170> what<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.560> leaks<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.039> plug<00:00:20.300> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
find what more leaks we can plug in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.540 
find what more leaks we can plug in
overall<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:22.140> his<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.310> kind<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
overall how his you know what kind of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.759 
overall how his you know what kind of
lines<00:00:23.789> he's<00:00:24.029> using<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:25.350> kind<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.590> place

lines he's using and what kind of place
he's<00:00:26.039> doing<00:00:26.369> I'm<00:00:27.240> hoping<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.539> he's<00:00:27.720> playing

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
he's doing I'm hoping that he's playing

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.750 
he's doing I'm hoping that he's playing
aggressively<00:00:28.619> because<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.640> we've

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
aggressively because that's what we've

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.669 
aggressively because that's what we've
been<00:00:29.789> focusing<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> recive<00:00:31.199> play<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
been focusing on is a recive play and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.910 
been focusing on is a recive play and
trying<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> avoid<00:00:32.340> passive<00:00:33.239> tendencies<00:00:33.690> but

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
trying to avoid passive tendencies but

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.130 
trying to avoid passive tendencies but
let's<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.160> how<00:00:35.309> he<00:00:35.370> does<00:00:35.430> alright<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.570> villain

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
let's see how he does alright so villain

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.560 
let's see how he does alright so villain
I<00:00:37.230> guess<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.559> unknown<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:39.239> Queen<00:00:39.450> yeah

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I guess is unknown can Queen yeah

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
I guess is unknown can Queen yeah
definitely<00:00:39.960> raising<00:00:40.350> button<00:00:40.980> um<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.579> think<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
definitely raising button um I think the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.950 
definitely raising button um I think the
sizing<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.629> fine<00:00:44.180> yes<00:00:45.180> certainly<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.750> in

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
sizing is fine yes certainly see that in

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.529 
sizing is fine yes certainly see that in
this<00:00:46.050> board<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.940> sizing<00:00:48.450> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
this board I think that that sizing is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.550 
this board I think that that sizing is
also<00:00:48.780> fine<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.739> I'll<00:00:50.039> ployed

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
know obviously it's a little bit of a

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.700 
know obviously it's a little bit of a
wet<00:01:06.130> board<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.910> but<00:01:07.870> at<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.050> same<00:01:08.230> time<00:01:08.410> I'm<00:01:08.620> a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
wet board and but at the same time I'm a

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.260 
wet board and but at the same time I'm a
few<00:01:08.860> play<00:01:09.010> around<00:01:09.190> with<00:01:09.370> up<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:09.760> you'll<00:01:10.030> find

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
few play around with up so you'll find

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.210 
few play around with up so you'll find
that<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.660> villa<00:01:11.290> just<00:01:11.530> don't<00:01:11.680> hit<00:01:11.800> this<00:01:11.950> board

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
that a villa just don't hit this board

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.210 
that a villa just don't hit this board
very<00:01:12.430> often<00:01:12.730> anyways<00:01:13.270> um<00:01:13.920> especially<00:01:14.920> since

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
very often anyways um especially since

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.040 
very often anyways um especially since
the<00:01:15.340> two<00:01:15.550> completely<00:01:16.000> misses<00:01:16.420> sliding

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
the two completely misses sliding

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.660 
the two completely misses sliding
rangers<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.470> general<00:01:17.740> so<00:01:17.890> yeah<00:01:18.040> definitely

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
rangers in general so yeah definitely

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.310 
rangers in general so yeah definitely
great<00:01:19.030> forward<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.360> see<00:01:19.450> bad<00:01:19.630> even<00:01:20.140> though<00:01:20.230> we

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
great forward to see bad even though we

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.640 
great forward to see bad even though we
have<00:01:20.410> complete<00:01:20.770> Mayer<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.380> checking<00:01:23.770> back<00:01:23.800> 92

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
have complete Mayer and checking back 92

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.600 
have complete Mayer and checking back 92
yeah<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:26.680> actually<00:01:26.890> think<00:01:27.130> this<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.430> very

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
yeah I actually think this is a very

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.490 
yeah I actually think this is a very
good<00:01:28.320> flock<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.590> lead<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.960> reason<00:01:32.260> being<00:01:32.380> that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
good flock to lead the reason being that

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.190 
good flock to lead the reason being that
we<00:01:32.770> won't<00:01:33.450> check<00:01:34.450> we're<00:01:34.630> using<00:01:34.780> here<00:01:34.990> is<00:01:35.050> going

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
we won't check we're using here is going

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.710 
we won't check we're using here is going
to<00:01:35.260> be<00:01:35.410> pretty<00:01:35.740> bad<00:01:35.890> because<00:01:36.250> we<00:01:36.880> can<00:01:37.240> expect<00:01:37.630> a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
to be pretty bad because we can expect a

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.480 
to be pretty bad because we can expect a
villain<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.050> bc<00:01:38.320> betting<00:01:38.590> or<00:01:38.890> limp<00:01:39.280> see

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
villain to bc betting or limp see

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.840 
villain to bc betting or limp see
vetting<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.810> board<00:01:41.080> with<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.770> lot<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
vetting this board with a lot of the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.480 
vetting this board with a lot of the
range<00:01:43.060> at<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.590> same<00:01:44.740> time<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.040> aboard<00:01:45.340> that's

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
range at the same time is aboard that's

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.090 
range at the same time is aboard that's
not<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.850> bad<00:01:46.260> for<00:01:47.260> villains<00:01:47.650> limping<00:01:47.920> range

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
not that bad for villains limping range

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.530 
not that bad for villains limping range
um<00:01:48.250> if<00:01:48.400> he's<00:01:48.520> limping<00:01:48.790> any<00:01:48.970> sort<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.180> middling

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
um if he's limping any sort of middling

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.710 
um if he's limping any sort of middling
stuff<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.979> actually<00:01:51.310> hits<00:01:51.460> his<00:01:51.610> range<00:01:52.270> kind<00:01:52.630> of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
stuff as actually hits his range kind of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.810 
stuff as actually hits his range kind of
harm<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:53.229> think<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:54.009> leading<00:01:54.430> out<00:01:54.550> here

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
harm so I think that leading out here

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.670 
harm so I think that leading out here
and<00:01:55.030> intending<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.479> barrel<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:56.259> quite<00:01:56.530> good

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
and intending to barrel is quite good

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.100 
and intending to barrel is quite good
especially<00:01:57.280> since<00:01:57.759> we<00:01:57.880> have<00:01:58.030> some<00:01:58.210> equity<00:01:58.330> my

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
especially since we have some equity my

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.749 
especially since we have some equity my
proud<00:01:59.350> probably<00:01:59.950> wouldn't<00:02:00.250> lead<00:02:00.430> here<00:02:00.640> with

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
proud probably wouldn't lead here with

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.180 
proud probably wouldn't lead here with
complete<00:02:01.090> air<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:02.590> given<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:02.830> we<00:02:02.979> haven't

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
complete air but given that we haven't

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.710 
complete air but given that we haven't
got<00:02:03.280> shot<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.759> our<00:02:03.910> state<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.240> seven<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.690> think

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
got shot to our state and seven I think

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.290 
got shot to our state and seven I think
this<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.140> perfect<00:02:05.320> spot<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.830> lead<00:02:06.030> try<00:02:07.030> gasm

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
this is a perfect spot to lead try gasm

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.749 
this is a perfect spot to lead try gasm
fold<00:02:07.479> equity<00:02:07.600> now<00:02:07.899> um<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.070> set<00:02:09.250> things<00:02:09.399> up<00:02:09.580> to

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
fold equity now um and set things up to

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.610 
fold equity now um and set things up to
be<00:02:09.880> able<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.179> pet<00:02:10.660> later<00:02:10.929> streets<00:02:11.260> for<00:02:11.440> fold

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
be able to pet later streets for fold

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.150 
be able to pet later streets for fold
equity<00:02:11.740> as<00:02:11.980> well<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.620> mind<00:02:14.890> yeah<00:02:15.040> I'm

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
equity as well so that mind yeah I'm

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.430 
equity as well so that mind yeah I'm
definitely<00:02:15.340> betting<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.940> turn<00:02:16.210> um<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.840> think

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
definitely betting this turn um I think

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960 
definitely betting this turn um I think
we<00:02:17.560> should<00:02:17.590> bet<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.400> bit<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> bigger

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
we should bet a little bit on the bigger

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.270 
we should bet a little bit on the bigger
side<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.600> things<00:02:19.810> i<00:02:20.140> would<00:02:20.530> probably<00:02:20.770> bet<00:02:20.890> 50

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
side of things i would probably bet 50

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.510 
side of things i would probably bet 50
here<00:02:22.020> notice<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.200> when<00:02:23.620> villain<00:02:23.950> flats<00:02:24.250> us

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
here notice that when villain flats us

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.800 
here notice that when villain flats us
on<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.880> flop<00:02:25.620> his<00:02:26.620> range<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.069> going<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
on that flop his range is going to be a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.930 
on that flop his range is going to be a
lot<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.840> mixture<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.350> straight<00:02:29.650> draws<00:02:29.860> as<00:02:30.160> well

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
lot of mixture of straight draws as well

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.559 
lot of mixture of straight draws as well
as<00:02:31.620> 78<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.010> maybe<00:02:33.580> some<00:02:33.910> jacks<00:02:34.120> probably<00:02:34.480> not

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
as 78 and maybe some jacks probably not

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.140 
as 78 and maybe some jacks probably not
many<00:02:34.750> jacks<00:02:35.020> but<00:02:35.260> some<00:02:35.590> 78<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.190> straight

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
many jacks but some 78 and straight

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.620 
many jacks but some 78 and straight
draws<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.819> we<00:02:39.819> really<00:02:40.030> want<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.420> be

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
draws and so we really want to be

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.470 
draws and so we really want to be
repping<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.230> jack<00:02:41.830> or<00:02:41.860> queen<00:02:42.310> when<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.180> bet<00:02:43.330> this

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
repping a jack or queen when we bet this

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000 
repping a jack or queen when we bet this
turn<00:02:43.660> we<00:02:43.840> want<00:02:44.110> him<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.290> fold<00:02:44.620> out<00:02:44.740> straight

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
turn we want him to fold out straight

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.170 
turn we want him to fold out straight
draws<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.340> mean<00:02:45.490> our<00:02:45.610> straight<00:02:45.819> draw<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.030> not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
draws I mean our straight draw is not

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.449 
draws I mean our straight draw is not
very<00:02:46.360> good<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:47.410> doesn't<00:02:47.770> have<00:02:47.980> an<00:02:48.069> over<00:02:48.250> card

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
very good and doesn't have an over card

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.750 
very good and doesn't have an over card
or<00:02:49.360> doesn't<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> high<00:02:49.990> card<00:02:50.490> at<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.580> same

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
or doesn't have a high card at the same

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.790 
or doesn't have a high card at the same
time<00:02:52.000> we<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:52.540> want<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.870> give<00:02:52.990> us<00:02:53.110> our<00:02:53.440> selves<00:02:53.709> a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
time we do want to give us our selves a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.440 
time we do want to give us our selves a
shot<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.190> folding<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> 7<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:54.970> think<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.240> is<00:02:55.300> a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
shot to folding on a 7 I think this is a

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.230 
shot to folding on a 7 I think this is a
pretty<00:02:55.660> good<00:02:55.840> turn<00:02:56.020> at<00:02:56.170> red<00:02:56.350> fall<00:02:56.530> down<00:02:56.650> seven

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
pretty good turn at red fall down seven

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.970 
pretty good turn at red fall down seven
but<00:02:58.240> we're<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.600> going<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.020> do<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.200> if<00:02:59.830> we're

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
but we're not going to do that if we're

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.890 
but we're not going to do that if we're
betting<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.400> small<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.840> we

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
betting so small so I think that we

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.160 
betting so small so I think that we
should<00:03:02.020> be<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> bigger<00:03:02.319> here<00:03:02.560> how<00:03:03.520> about<00:03:03.760> 50<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
should be a bigger here how about 50 and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.320 
should be a bigger here how about 50 and
I'm<00:03:05.260> pretty<00:03:05.530> happy<00:03:05.879> intending<00:03:06.879> to<00:03:06.970> triple

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
I'm pretty happy intending to triple

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.110 
I'm pretty happy intending to triple
barrel<00:03:07.540> if<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:07.989> bet<00:03:08.140> 50

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
barrel if we bet 50

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.050 
barrel if we bet 50
as<00:03:09.560> played<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.920> mean<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:11.580> we're<00:03:11.849> still

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
as played I mean I think we're still

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.220 
as played I mean I think we're still
barreling<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.480> mean<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> perfect

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
barreling I mean this is the perfect

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.830 
barreling I mean this is the perfect
card<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:14.129> us<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.340> bear<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.549> lot<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.390> while

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
card for us to bear a lot so while

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.949 
card for us to bear a lot so while
obviously<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.590> don't<00:03:16.739> rep<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.959> villain

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
obviously we don't rep it a villain

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.500 
obviously we don't rep it a villain
doesn't<00:03:19.349> wrap<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> either<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.069> we<00:03:20.480> can<00:03:21.480> I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
doesn't wrap it either and we can I

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.930 
doesn't wrap it either and we can I
think<00:03:21.989> scared<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.830> mean<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.430> can't<00:03:23.700> put<00:03:23.909> our

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
think scared I mean we can't put our

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.490 
think scared I mean we can't put our
villain<00:03:24.269> as<00:03:24.360> being<00:03:24.569> very<00:03:24.720> intelligent<00:03:25.319> or

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
villain as being very intelligent or

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.649 
villain as being very intelligent or
being<00:03:25.709> able<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.010> Henry<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.090> don't<00:03:27.390> think

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
being able to Henry so I don't think

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.619 
being able to Henry so I don't think
that<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:28.049> know<00:03:28.549> we<00:03:29.549> should<00:03:29.579> say<00:03:29.940> oh<00:03:30.150> well<00:03:30.420> you

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
that you know we should say oh well you

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.319 
that you know we should say oh well you
know<00:03:30.659> its<00:03:30.870> limbs<00:03:31.079> pot<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.680> check<00:03:31.920> back<00:03:32.329> we

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
know its limbs pot we check back we

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.660 
know its limbs pot we check back we
can't<00:03:33.599> repin<00:03:33.900> ace<00:03:34.049> well<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.739> mean<00:03:34.950> that's<00:03:35.069> true

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
can't repin ace well I mean that's true

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.470 
can't repin ace well I mean that's true
but<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.269> mean<00:03:36.420> how<00:03:36.599> much<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.650> random<00:03:38.040> villain

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
but I mean how much can a random villain

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.990 
but I mean how much can a random villain
REM<00:03:39.480> read<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:40.560> don't<00:03:41.190> think<00:03:41.430> it's<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.819> point

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
REM read I don't think it's to the point

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.539 
REM read I don't think it's to the point
where<00:03:42.239> he's<00:03:42.420> able<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.410> river<00:03:43.620> look<00:03:44.340> all

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
where he's able to on the river look all

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.949 
where he's able to on the river look all
the<00:03:44.730> way<00:03:44.760> back<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.359> fact<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.629> we<00:03:45.750> lived

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
the way back to the fact that we lived

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.440 
the way back to the fact that we lived
pre<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.609> think<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.150> still

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
pre and so I do think this is still

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.390 
pre and so I do think this is still
scare<00:03:48.780> card<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.200> think<00:03:49.620> obviously<00:03:49.739> folds<00:03:50.340> out

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
scare card I think obviously folds out

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.369 
scare card I think obviously folds out
all<00:03:50.579> straight<00:03:50.940> draws<00:03:51.150> at<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.359> point<00:03:51.629> but

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
all straight draws at this point but

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.140 
all straight draws at this point but
also<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.739> think<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.190> we<00:03:53.489> are<00:03:53.640> folding<00:03:54.030> out<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
also I think that we are folding out a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.569 
also I think that we are folding out a
seven<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.629> this<00:03:54.780> point<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.470> likely<00:03:56.129> in<00:03:56.370> eight

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
seven at this point and likely in eight

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.800 
seven at this point and likely in eight
as<00:03:56.730> well<00:03:56.879> so<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> think<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.540> perfect

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
as well so I think this is the perfect

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.530 
as well so I think this is the perfect
card<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.349> barrel<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.879> I<00:03:59.970> would<00:04:00.180> bet<00:04:00.359> this

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
card to barrel and I would bet this

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.789 
card to barrel and I would bet this
river<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:00.930> would<00:04:01.049> bet<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.290> kind<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.680> baked

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
river and I would bet it kind of baked

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.069 
river and I would bet it kind of baked
like<00:04:01.950> probably<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.340> hundred<00:04:02.489> here<00:04:02.909> to<00:04:03.780> really

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
like probably a hundred here to really

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.899 
like probably a hundred here to really
try<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.409> get<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.799> seven<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.280> maybe<00:04:05.430> even<00:04:05.730> an

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
try to get the seven and maybe even an

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.690 
try to get the seven and maybe even an
eight<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.599> fold<00:04:07.040> it's<00:04:08.040> pretty<00:04:08.340> much<00:04:08.489> perfect

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
eight to fold it's pretty much perfect

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.349 
eight to fold it's pretty much perfect
for<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:10.129> so<00:04:11.129> yeah<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.310> would<00:04:11.609> have<00:04:11.790> prada

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
for that so yeah I would have prada

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.690 
for that so yeah I would have prada
fired<00:04:12.659> and<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.859> really<00:04:14.280> think<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.519> we

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
fired and and I really think that we

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.729 
fired and and I really think that we
would<00:04:14.819> be<00:04:15.000> folding<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.419> seven<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.930> betting

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
would be folding that seven out betting

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.070 
would be folding that seven out betting
this<00:04:16.829> room
