00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.220

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.230
 makeup that I'm going to wear for the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.400
 valentine's day and do not ask me this 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.550
 that I'm going to do I'm going to keep for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 me but according to me halloween christmas and to 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.370
 farmingdale are the three periods of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.680
 the year we can really really 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.330
 abused the red and suddenly I took out 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.340
 everything but red lipstick just 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.500
 chose the one I liked the most 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.070
 for this period and I chose the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.960
 viva glam and where he plays the viva glam of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.150
 rihanna to do this target makeup 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.890
 so I adapted a little bit of everything else from 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.120
 museums to this lipstick so has it so 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.540
 it interests you I would let myself 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.540
 video camera 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.410
 I start by applying a drop in 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.270
 dyed to hold my makeup and 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.900
 also to prevent my face from shining 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.610
 some time in the evening and avoid 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.870
 any disaster that starts with a 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.630
 good base i then apply monsanto 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.030
 today is I would like a 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.550
 finish a little a very natural actually 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 but at the same time very homogeneous so with 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.150
 a purpose i blatter or a sponge 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.620
 you can have this result there and 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 it's the first time I 've used 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.430
 little blender and I find that the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.490
 result exactly what I wanted 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.270
 in homogeneous natural is actually like 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.580
 a second beautiful you on your face 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.070
 I continue with a concealer but that 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.750
 I use more to bring 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.330
 light and dimension on my 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.090
 face for me to Africa under the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.670
 eyes only on the fist on the nose and on 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.410
 the coat I just melt it all 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.140
 again with my wife for 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.140
 continue to have this finish that I want 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.280
 and I decided to import this too 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.080
 light touch between my jaw and the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.700
 hollow of my days to continue to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.170
 define my face and you see that that 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.480
 dig at the same time but play I 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.120
 know not bad with multipla ne 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.130
 was not very natural and 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.360
 in the end we do not even go too 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.050
 happy it makes a very beautiful illusion 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.390
 but I am rather a fan I fix everything 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.490
 with a translucent powder waiting for that 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.490
 the blues corrector on you 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 I 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.090
 my eyebrows it's as usual a 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.910
 little pencil to draw the outline 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.730
 and have the shape that I want and then 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.060
 I just fill the mix at a lighthouse 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.590
 dark brown dark with the pencil so I 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.960
 mix all that with a brush and it's 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.770
 what I usually do 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.960
 today I would like to have the 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.850
 eyebrows rather perfect so a minute 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.580
 from source he was leaving obviously 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.990
 so I bring with a create a 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.270
 corrector pardon and a brush well 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.580
 well provided I draw a little outline 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.130
 of my eyebrows and I come to melt the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.270
 just as beauty blender 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.450
 clears everything 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.880
 any prohibition 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.710
 we continue with the eyes so I do 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.420
 something very natural 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.690
 nothing extraordinary I start with 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.000
 a park or their eyelids of natural and 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.790
 I come to dig my eyes a little or 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.420
 hollow of my eyelid with a blush impute 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.640
 with plums 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.800
 you can use any 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.450
 other lighthouse louder it's me i'm going 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.050
 throw for the fruit test that makes a 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.050
 little more pretty 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.490
 with a blender brush by this mixture 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.220
 I'm coming to melt the two colors 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.980
 together but I also come to blur them 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.410
 edges of this makeup to have a 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.630
 made even more natural and with a 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.060
 lighter makeup I come bring touch 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.700
 Lyon receives an eyebrow and 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.920
 so continue to define my face and 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.180
 to have the impression of having eyes of 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.709
 well the line of eyeliner and as I 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.209
 do not do much makeup my eyes 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.510
 I would really like to have a very old 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.480
 perfect anar and this I can do it 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.430
 with a mile high the arjel in a pot and 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.200
 a brush or I can really of them is 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.480
 in fact the amount of product that 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.150
 I would love to have on my eyes is also 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.640
 lose track I want it but it takes 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.440
 be very careful because with this 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.269
 makeup of super natural we have almost 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.720
 that your work of art will 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.280
 really really do it very 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.770
 slowly 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.550
 try to have a trait more or less 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.770
 6000 trick 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.300
 so take your time actually 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.340
 breaks that's what I do in the 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.830
 comparing to another I make pots 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.080
 game made by small strokes and it takes some 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.080
 time but in the end it works 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.560
 and they can finish of course it takes 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.690
 that I give this because I am too 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.820
 too happy to have passed this step 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.130
 there and I continue with mascara 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.810
 this one get up all done so alone 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.630
 that I quoted you today because 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.000
 I loved it really makes them to me 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.490
 will give doe eyelashes in fact I have 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.009
 need eight fossils for once and 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.380
 this relay 6 out of the bar which I 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.500
 do not use this mascara June in 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.430
 normal astarac I continue my account at 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.530
 ring with you can use one by one 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.630
 product dies what you want but I 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.759
 continues to dig but plays for 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.550
 continue to dimension consider having 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:27.050
 a pretty face and I 'm going to show the 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.050
 just as far as the front 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.399
 a little blush I take a very blush 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.469
 natural because once again I 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:39.219
 want to have a very natural complexion 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:42.069
 beautifully carved and as I wear a 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.949
 red dress not see a big bluff 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.809
 farting and I sting his makeup the 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.529
 leftover makeup with a powder in 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:52.449
 reality of shining of course I draw 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:55.959
 the outline of my lips with a pencil 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.509
 rather dark lips so that allows me 

00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:00.429
 to have a demarcation not too much 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.430
 pronounced between red lipstick 

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:06.039
 and my skin in skin color 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.619
 so I trace the outline I fill a 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.779
 little inward indeed andrÃ© and 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:14.009
 then comes the lipstick so I 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.009
 apply it normally 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.300
 and that's optional in fact so if 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.500
 you want it if you want to have 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.310
 it's party 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.630
 I'm going back through a pencil again through 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.760
 in this same niche that I have 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.890
 used for the base and with a 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.440
 corrector I correct a little every 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.050
 parts a little overwhelmed you can 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.240
 then faded that to the fingers or with 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.190
 your gander shop but like your 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.910
 6th it is a corrector especially remember 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.610
 not to iron with a powder and that's it 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.500
 that's all I like this makeup 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.270
 quiet suitable for both 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.130
 couples only for 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.640
 singles or even to make you 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.570
 pleasure 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:03.950
 so I hope it's successful are you 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.660
 will tell you finished I really hope that 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.400
 it stinks to please you I make a reaction 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.350
 allergic actually on my face so 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.000
 if you see me in fact super super 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.740
 ready you will see that I have plenty of 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.690
 little pimples on the face it's just 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.370
 filthy and I do not know yet what 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.200
 this is due I test several things in 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.890
 this moment so unfortunately it has me 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.630
 given buttons 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.490
 so I can not go too far 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.420
 level make up but let's be realistic 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.760
 because I have already done something 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.870
 crazy level make up 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.730
 I give you lots of kisses and tell you 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.730
 very soon bah me there
