00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the root and for this time you typically

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.900 
the root and for this time you typically
like<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.410> twist<00:01:57.680> around<00:01:57.800> two<00:01:58.100> times<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.730> bring

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.850 
rest of my hair just a few front layers
in<00:03:20.090> my<00:03:20.150> bangs<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:21.019> have<00:03:21.200> grown<00:03:21.440> out<00:03:21.590> and

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
in my bangs that have grown out and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.890 
in my bangs that have grown out and
that's<00:03:22.340> about<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:22.640> also<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.420> wanted<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.690> mention

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
that's about it also I wanted to mention

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.180 
that's about it also I wanted to mention
if<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.170> do<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:26.530> shorter<00:03:27.530> bangs<00:03:27.739> than<00:03:28.040> me

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
if you do have shorter bangs than me

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.100 
if you do have shorter bangs than me
this<00:03:28.519> may<00:03:28.760> be<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:28.940> little<00:03:29.269> bit<00:03:29.420> hard<00:03:29.690> because<00:03:29.870> I

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
this may be a little bit hard because I

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.890 
this may be a little bit hard because I
try<00:03:30.560> doing<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.040> same<00:03:31.070> technique<00:03:31.570> when<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.600> had

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
try doing the same technique when I had

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.690 
try doing the same technique when I had
shorter<00:03:33.380> bangs<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.799> were<00:03:33.890> probably<00:03:34.340> up<00:03:34.640> to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
shorter bangs that were probably up to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.630 
shorter bangs that were probably up to
my<00:03:35.000> eye<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:36.709> didn't<00:03:37.130> really<00:03:37.220> work<00:03:37.370> out

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
my eye and it didn't really work out

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.190 
my eye and it didn't really work out
that<00:03:37.700> well<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:38.299> if<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.570> do<00:03:38.780> have<00:03:38.930> shorter

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that well so if you do have shorter

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.690 
that well so if you do have shorter
bangs<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.470> this<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.739> not<00:03:39.980> working<00:03:40.370> for<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.670> I

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700
