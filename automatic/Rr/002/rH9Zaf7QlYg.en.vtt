over<00:00:22.669> 15<00:00:23.270> years<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.349> challenge<00:00:24.529> for<00:00:24.860> us

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
over 15 years so the challenge for us

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.070 
over 15 years so the challenge for us
was<00:00:25.519> to<00:00:25.550> achieve<00:00:25.939> this<00:00:26.060> diversity<00:00:26.779> while

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
was to achieve this diversity while

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.070 
was to achieve this diversity while
keeping<00:00:27.679> an<00:00:27.830> organic<00:00:28.310> look<00:00:28.519> to<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:28.789> all<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.480> we

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
keeping an organic look to it all so we

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.729 
the same level of details and it also
one<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.720> biggest<00:04:02.930> challenges<00:04:03.530> was<00:04:03.590> to

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
one of the biggest challenges was to

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.530 
one of the biggest challenges was to
create<00:04:03.980> an<00:04:04.190> open<00:04:04.489> world<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.910> we<00:04:05.000> can<00:04:05.150> see<00:04:05.359> in

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
create an open world that we can see in

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.300 
create an open world that we can see in
the<00:04:05.600> Navajo<00:04:06.049> sequence<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.920> scenery

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
the Navajo sequence the scenery

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.190 
the Navajo sequence the scenery
represents<00:04:07.909> about<00:04:08.000> 2<00:04:08.360> square<00:04:08.750> kilometers

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
represents about 2 square kilometers

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.690 
represents about 2 square kilometers
but<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:10.560> another<00:04:10.770> challenge<00:04:11.250> was<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.400> build

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
but it's another challenge was to build

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.430 
but it's another challenge was to build
a<00:04:11.790> section<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.360> city<00:04:12.629> we<00:04:13.020> did<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> lot<00:04:13.410> of

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
a section of a city we did a lot of

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.140 
a section of a city we did a lot of
research<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:14.010> homeless<00:04:14.370> people<00:04:14.700> lived<00:04:14.910> in<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
research on homeless people lived in the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.319 
research on homeless people lived in the
United<00:04:15.569> States<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.579> guess<00:04:17.579> we<00:04:17.730> pushed<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.150> both

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
United States I guess we pushed on both

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.180 
United States I guess we pushed on both
our<00:04:18.510> engine<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.169> capabilities<00:04:19.950> of<00:04:19.980> the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
our engine and the capabilities of the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.050 
our engine and the capabilities of the
ps3<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.740> find<00:04:23.010> ourselves<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:23.520> atmospheres

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
ps3 we can find ourselves in atmospheres

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.850 
ps3 we can find ourselves in atmospheres
totally<00:04:24.540> different<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.169> inside<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.650> same

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
totally different but inside the same

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.740 
totally different but inside the same
sequence<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.880> move<00:04:27.090> from<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.360> daytime

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
sequence we move from a daytime

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.659 
sequence we move from a daytime
environment<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> sunset<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.280> nighttime

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
environment to a sunset and nighttime

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.090 
environment to a sunset and nighttime
environment<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.380> same<00:04:31.620> sequence

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
environment this is the same sequence

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.550 
environment this is the same sequence
the<00:04:32.520> same<00:04:32.760> street<00:04:33.120> but<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.840> totally<00:04:34.260> different

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
the same street but a totally different

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.600 
the same street but a totally different
atmosphere<00:04:36.380> for<00:04:37.380> all<00:04:37.530> our<00:04:37.650> effects<00:04:38.040> we<00:04:38.310> relied

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
atmosphere for all our effects we relied

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.129 
atmosphere for all our effects we relied
heavily<00:04:38.639> on<00:04:39.090> our<00:04:39.360> internally<00:04:39.870> developed

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
heavily on our internally developed

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.230 
heavily on our internally developed
particle<00:04:40.800> system<00:04:41.160> because<00:04:41.700> it<00:04:41.820> allowed<00:04:42.060> us<00:04:42.090> to

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
particle system because it allowed us to

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.820 
particle system because it allowed us to
display<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.720> large<00:04:43.110> number<00:04:43.440> of<00:04:43.470> small

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
display a large number of small

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.290 
display a large number of small
particles<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.610> which<00:04:44.760> we<00:04:44.910> could<00:04:45.090> apply

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
particles in which we could apply

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.980 
particles in which we could apply
physics-based<00:04:45.930> dynamics<00:04:47.570> just<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.660> thanks<00:04:48.930> to

physics-based dynamics just a thanks to
this<00:04:49.200> we've<00:04:49.470> been<00:04:49.620> able<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.889> have<00:04:50.100> Jody<00:04:50.430> escape

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
this we've been able to have Jody escape

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.760 
this we've been able to have Jody escape

tried<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.520> push<00:05:05.760> our<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.330> limits<00:05:06.660> of<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.870> PSP

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
tried to push our the limits of the PSP

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.800 
tried to push our the limits of the PSP
just<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.979> be<00:05:08.100> able<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.610> recreate<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.419> journey

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
just to be able to recreate this journey
