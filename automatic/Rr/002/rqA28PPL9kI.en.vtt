00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.580
 teach you how to remove this pretty 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 chewing gum that stuck to my fabric 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.389
 to remove it you will need some 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 ice cubes that you put in a bag 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.449
 plastic and soap from Marseille 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.699
 not to mention a teaspoon and a 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 small water basin how is that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.349
 I proceed by taking ice cubes that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 I'm going to pose on my fabric and who are going 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 to freeze the chewing gum that I 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.329
 the next morning 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.129
 the chewing gum will be completely frozen 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.300
 a small indication if ever it is 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.860
 chewing gum without sugar 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.510
 take off your chewing gum by putting 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.820
 freezer in this case it will take 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.649
 do the reverse operation to know at 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.510
