00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.880
 hello here is your rasselbande 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.699
 today, it's about the theme of furnishing 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.259
 I'll take a rapping cage 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.390
 enumerate a few things 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.090
 with this you your rats against 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.129
 could easily set up as well 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.860
 I name a few things you can 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.600
 It should be noted first of all 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.070
 need rats in their cages 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.500
 of course, hiding and 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.660
 Sleeps you should 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.890
 Be careful that the rats always 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.350
 at least that many 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.870
 The rats have hiding places 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.730
 every animal is included in the enclosure 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.230
 also needs to withdraw individually 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.690
 can 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.550
 best of all are for this of course 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.070
 commercial homes suitable this it 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.170
 in each to act gives the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.980
 Houses should be a minimum size 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.850
 of 15 x 20 cm have at least 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.530
 two animals in the house have all the space 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.649
 openings on the houses should 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.710
 be at least 6 to 8 inches tall with it 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.509
 The rat also fits comfortably through 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.509
 although it is also general in size 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.899
 the rat is more likely to arrive 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:28.100
 even straight bucks had bigger ones 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.929
 openings or even houses need if 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.829
 you are not sure which size 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.109
 to take their 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.869
 always take the houses the best 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.359
 you seem too big for them 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.149
 you will be advised too small 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.819
 Thank the big place in the house for sure 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.539
 the houses can be made of wood 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.429
 ceramic or plastic exist because 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.709
 You should pay attention to that 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.229
 enough air holes are available around 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.419
 ensure a good air circulation 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.069
 to be able to 

00:01:55.419 --> 00:02:00.469
 In addition, plastic objects should 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.319
 should be noted too strongly 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.509
 be removed from the cage around thus 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.539
 to avoid a risk of injury 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.580
 at the houses from hay you should only 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.459
 which do not take a wire frame in 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.500
 have inner and this also before 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.410
 at least for a day in the freezer compartment 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 thus create a mite infestation 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.870
 Of course , what prevent a rat too 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.760
 need are fodder or water nets 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.110
 again rat holder should be 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.480
 at least two or 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 Add three pieces depending on whether you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.300
 would like to use a nipple cabinets 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.170
 or not 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.940
 you need a napf dry food 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.080
 influence fresh food and, where appropriate 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.750
 one for the water 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.700
 the nets should be made of ceramic 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.820
 be that they are heavy and that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.410
 rats can not upset the bowls 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.030
 Also, in every guess cage 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.520
 several toilets will be available 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.070
 I recommend at least two toilets 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.810
 to put in a cage at a size 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.270
 from three to four animals 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.070
 But this always comes to the cage 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.780
 size 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.820
 because rats are very lazy and have 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.590
 Do not always feel like running forever 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.870
 to go to the toilet 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.480
 The toilets can be made of ceramic 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.090
 clay plastic or stainless steel 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.730
 Do it at the company Cascade job online 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.900
 There are many rats to buy as well 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.000
 Love is hammocks 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.770
 This is both in zoo stores as 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.080
 also online shops in different 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.300
 Who can buy variants? 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.950
 may want to get away too cheap 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.110
 just a towel as a hammock 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.730
 use 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.620
 There are also cuddly tunnels and houses 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.320
 to hang often also popular 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.810
 Rats a good online shop for cuddles 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.200
 the hammock and co are here 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.450
 Incidentally annas cuddly things with a 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.380
 absolute highlight in a rap 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.140
 Cages are sputniks that are small 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.209
 Round I'll say plastic house 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.560
 either put it in g or 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.630
 can be hung 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.090
 Despite all this, you should also be here 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.160
 again the sputniks out of the cage 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.790
 removed if they are too hot 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.610
 become 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.980
 Furthermore, you can still use the cage 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.160
 various climbing possibilities 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.620
 set up 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.230
 this are especially good bird 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.000
 ropes or even first out of the woods though 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.269
 please do not take it directly from the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.940
 roadside or by the way and what 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.850
 the first also good before use 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.860
 and put them in the oven so that from 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.960
 any bacteria are released 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.510
 Earlier are also good 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.650
 possibility to the rats alternations 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.570
 Cage to offer 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.490
 but this should also be the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.880
 minimum diameter to be observed 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.680
 this is 12 cm or larger 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.960
 so that two rates synonymous problems 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.730
 In addition, you can pass each other 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.800
 The tubes should be ventilated many times 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.930
 holes have around here again 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.850
 ensure good air circulation too 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.380
 can 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.720
 In addition, Corcoran and both offer 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.150
 bridge also good hidden or 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.410
 Climbing possibilities at this one 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.270
 either hang up or set 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.160
 These were some things with this man 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.150
 Without hesitation, be save cage 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
 can set up 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.050
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.810
 could still help some of them 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.940
 have no idea how they are 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.850
 want to set up your rat cage 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.170
 furthermore, of course, fantasy is natural 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.420
 no limits set 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.430
 There are a few more things with it 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.820
 to set up your rat cage 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.160
 can 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.780
 These are not always necessarily in 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.290
 but find a zoo 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.790
 maybe completely somewhere else 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.980
 In addition, craftsmen can also join 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.870
 The facility let off steam at that time 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.590
 also a lot of accessories resp 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.120
 Make your own furniture 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.650
 can 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.540
 if you have any other furnishings 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.370
 you have the suggestions 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.910
 Write below in the comments 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.860
 as well as ask that that's it now 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.050
 but so far from me then I say 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.050
 until next time and
