this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.420> origami<00:00:09.780> crane

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
this is the video for the origami crane

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
this is the video for the origami crane
the<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:11.160> step<00:00:11.400> for<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> traditional

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the first step for the traditional

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.259 
the first step for the traditional
origami<00:00:12.509> crane<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.889> diagonal<00:00:14.340> fold<00:00:14.730> so

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
origami crane is a diagonal fold so

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.510 
origami crane is a diagonal fold so
we're<00:00:15.360> gonna<00:00:15.450> start<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> color<00:00:16.049> side<00:00:16.109> up

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
we're gonna start with the color side up

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.880 
we're gonna start with the color side up
and<00:00:17.520> then<00:00:17.640> go<00:00:17.760> ahead<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:17.970> fold<00:00:18.560> bottom<00:00:19.560> corner

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and then go ahead and fold bottom corner

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460 
and then go ahead and fold bottom corner
up<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> top<00:00:20.430> quarter<00:00:21.080> make<00:00:22.080> sure<00:00:22.260> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
up to the top quarter make sure that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.019 
up to the top quarter make sure that
it's<00:00:22.619> nice<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.010> lined<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.910> very

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it's nice and lined up so it's very

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.599 
it's nice and lined up so it's very
precise<00:00:24.510> we're<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:24.990> trying<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.609> super

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
precise we're not trying to go super

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.450 
precise we're not trying to go super
fast<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:27.240> try<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.130> exactly<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.429> that

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
fast just try and get it exactly on that

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.510 
fast just try and get it exactly on that
spot<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:31.170> slide<00:00:31.500> your<00:00:31.529> finger<00:00:32.009> down<00:00:32.160> out

spot and then slide your finger down out
to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.820> corner<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> other

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
to the corner and then out to the other

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.700 
to the corner and then out to the other
corner<00:00:34.940> open<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.030> back<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.620> then<00:00:37.620> we're

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
corner open it back up and then we're

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.049 
corner open it back up and then we're
gonna<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> other<00:00:38.129> diagonal<00:00:38.460> fold<00:00:38.790> so

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
gonna do the other diagonal fold so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.069 
gonna do the other diagonal fold so
again<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> bottom<00:00:40.620> bring<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.890> up

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
again take the bottom bring it up

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.150 
again take the bottom bring it up
everything<00:00:43.079> nice<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.500> lined<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:43.890> like

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
everything nice and lined up just like

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.540 
everything nice and lined up just like
that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.940 
that
and<00:00:45.020> open<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.110> back<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> nice

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and open it back up so you have a nice

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.850 
and open it back up so you have a nice
plus<00:00:47.700> sign<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.360> creases<00:00:48.800> flip<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
plus sign with your creases flip the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
plus sign with your creases flip the
paper<00:00:50.010> over<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.079> now<00:00:52.079> we're<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.500> two

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
paper over and now we're going to do two

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.160 
paper over and now we're going to do two
book<00:00:52.920> folds<00:00:53.449> it's<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> take<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> bottom

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
book folds it's going to take the bottom

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.369 
book folds it's going to take the bottom
edge<00:00:56.059> bring<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> top<00:00:57.600> edge<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
edge bring it up to the top edge and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.189 
edge bring it up to the top edge and
again<00:00:59.100> make<00:00:59.460> sure<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.820> not<00:00:59.940> askew<00:01:00.629> off

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
again make sure that it's not askew off

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
again make sure that it's not askew off
to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> side<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.100> I'll<00:01:02.190> try<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.670> nice

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
to the side and I'll try and get it nice

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.190 
to the side and I'll try and get it nice
and<00:01:03.650> even<00:01:04.650> across<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> top<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.720> once<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.020> do

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and even across the top and once you do

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
and even across the top and once you do
crease<00:01:07.740> down<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
crease down just like that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.620 
crease down just like that
and<00:01:10.280> then<00:01:11.280> open<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> other

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and then open it up and do the other

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.789 
and then open it up and do the other
book<00:01:12.900> fold<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.409> well<00:01:15.380> just<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:18.799> now

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
book fold as well just like that now

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.170 
book fold as well just like that now
once<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.400> last<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:20.939> ahead<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
once you have that last one go ahead and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
once you have that last one go ahead and
leave<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> crease<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> pick<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
leave that crease down and pick up the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.230 
leave that crease down and pick up the
model<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.610> bit<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:23.880> we're<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
model a little bit what we're going to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.560 
model a little bit what we're going to
do<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.619> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> pinch<00:01:26.009> right<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.970> right

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
do is if you pinch right here and right

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.649 
do is if you pinch right here and right
here<00:01:27.860> near<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> top<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.060> corners<00:01:30.479> what

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
here near the top of the corners what

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.910 
here near the top of the corners what
we're<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.350> we're<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.060 
we're going to do is we're going to
rotate<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.549> model<00:01:32.880> up<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
rotate the model up just like this you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
rotate the model up just like this you
see<00:01:35.250> how<00:01:35.340> we're<00:01:35.490> getting<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.939> four<00:01:36.450> corners

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
see how we're getting all four corners

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.120 
see how we're getting all four corners
of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> paper<00:01:37.259> are<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> come<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
of the paper are going to come up and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.450 
of the paper are going to come up and
touch<00:01:38.280> each<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.780> right<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> top<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
touch each other right at the top and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
touch each other right at the top and
then<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.880> how<00:01:42.060> we've<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.600> these<00:01:42.720> extra

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
then you see how we've got these extra

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.160 
then you see how we've got these extra
flaps<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> squash<00:01:45.000> those<00:01:45.270> flaps<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
flaps we can squash those flaps down and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
flaps we can squash those flaps down and
this<00:01:46.380> doesn't<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:46.890> any<00:01:47.189> new<00:01:47.460> creases<00:01:47.700> we

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this doesn't use any new creases we

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.749 
this doesn't use any new creases we
haven't<00:01:48.210> made<00:01:48.390> anything<00:01:48.750> new<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.229> just

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
haven't made anything new this is just

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.069 
haven't made anything new this is just
using<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.270> folds<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.780> already

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
using all of the folds that we already

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.760 
using all of the folds that we already
have<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:54.000> create<00:01:54.390> what's<00:01:54.780> called<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.320> square

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
have to create what's called a square

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.340 
have to create what's called a square
base<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> preliminary<00:01:56.640> base<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
base or a preliminary base and the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
base or a preliminary base and the
important<00:01:58.740> thing<00:01:58.860> about<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.189> orientation<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
important thing about the orientation of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.580 
important thing about the orientation of
the<00:02:00.210> base<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.079> make<00:02:01.200> sure<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> these

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the base is to make sure that these

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
the base is to make sure that these
flaps<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.490> open<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:02.969> they<00:02:03.390> have

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
flaps that we have open here they have

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.380 
flaps that we have open here they have
to<00:02:03.869> be<00:02:03.960> towards<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.520> make

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to be towards you so get them and make

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180 
to be towards you so get them and make
sure<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.659> they're<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> top<00:02:07.500> but

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
sure that they're not up at the top but

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.650 
sure that they're not up at the top but
that<00:02:08.369> those<00:02:08.459> extra<00:02:08.789> flaps<00:02:09.149> are<00:02:09.360> pointed

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that those extra flaps are pointed

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.930 
that those extra flaps are pointed
towards<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> not<00:02:10.379> off<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> side<00:02:11.039> but

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
towards you not off to the side but

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.370 
towards you not off to the side but
right<00:02:12.330> down

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
at you next we're going to do two kite

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.200 
at you next we're going to do two kite
folds<00:02:17.160> we're<00:02:17.670> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.880> take<00:02:18.000> these<00:02:18.150> two

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
folds we're going to take these two

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.080 
folds we're going to take these two
bottom<00:02:18.840> edges<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:20.040> lead<00:02:20.310> down<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.820> open

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
bottom edges that lead down to the open

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.720 
bottom edges that lead down to the open
flap<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.510> we're<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.810> fold<00:02:22.110> them<00:02:22.730> into

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
flap and we're going to fold them into

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.330 
flap and we're going to fold them into
the<00:02:24.150> middle<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.290> paper<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.830> right<00:02:26.190> on

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.760 
the middle of the paper just right on
that<00:02:26.700> middle<00:02:27.060> line<00:02:27.240> right<00:02:27.690> all<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.410> way<00:02:28.530> down

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
that middle line right all the way down

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.390 
that middle line right all the way down
to<00:02:29.340> on<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.550> left-hand<00:02:29.970> side<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.860> also<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.100> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
to on the left-hand side and also on the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.350 
to on the left-hand side and also on the
right<00:02:32.610> hand<00:02:32.640> side<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.800> like<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:36.240> then

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
right hand side just like that and then

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.170 
right hand side just like that and then
once<00:02:36.570> we've<00:02:36.720> done<00:02:36.900> both<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.470> those<00:02:37.910> go<00:02:38.910> ahead

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
once we've done both of those go ahead

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.400 
once we've done both of those go ahead
and<00:02:39.420> fold<00:02:39.930> down<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:41.850> top<00:02:42.360> triangle<00:02:42.930> right

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
and fold down this top triangle right

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.080 
and fold down this top triangle right
here<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.070> go<00:02:44.220> all<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.730> way<00:02:44.760> across

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
here it's going to go all the way across

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.450 
here it's going to go all the way across
this<00:02:45.480> line<00:02:45.780> that's<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.920> crease<00:02:47.160> line<00:02:47.340> that

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
this line that's the crease line that

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.920 
this line that's the crease line that
we're<00:02:47.550> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> use<00:02:47.850> we<00:02:48.090> fold<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.570> triangle

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
we're going to use we fold that triangle

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.600 
we're going to use we fold that triangle
down<00:02:50.570> just<00:02:51.570> like<00:02:51.720> that

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
down just like that

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.410 
down just like that
next<00:02:53.610> flip<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.090> whole<00:02:54.330> thing<00:02:54.390> over<00:02:56.210> with<00:02:57.210> this

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
next flip the whole thing over with this

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.180 
next flip the whole thing over with this
make<00:02:57.810> sure<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.230> triangle<00:02:58.620> flap<00:02:58.920> this

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
make sure that this triangle flap this

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.670 
make sure that this triangle flap this
is<00:02:59.370> on<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.970> bottom<00:03:00.150> underneath<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.110> now

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
is on the bottom underneath and now

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.600 
is on the bottom underneath and now
we're<00:03:01.770> gonna<00:03:01.860> do<00:03:01.950> those<00:03:02.130> two<00:03:02.340> kite<00:03:02.580> folds

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
we're gonna do those two kite folds

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.470 
we're gonna do those two kite folds
we're<00:03:03.000> gonna<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.180> those<00:03:03.330> again<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:05.640> side

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.700 

just<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:12.290> now<00:03:13.290> once<00:03:13.560> you've<00:03:13.680> done

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
just like that now once you've done

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.830 
just like that now once you've done
those<00:03:13.950> two<00:03:14.130> kite<00:03:14.370> folds<00:03:14.420> go<00:03:15.420> ahead<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.690> open

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
those two kite folds go ahead and open

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.020 
those two kite folds go ahead and open
those<00:03:16.170> back<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:16.640> those<00:03:17.640> are<00:03:17.790> what<00:03:17.910> we<00:03:18.000> call

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
those back up those are what we call

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.850 
those back up those are what we call
preliminary<00:03:18.750> folds<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.260> we're<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.770> to

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
preliminary folds that we're going to

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.370 
preliminary folds that we're going to
use<00:03:20.100> those<00:03:20.370> creases<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:21.570> use<00:03:21.750> another<00:03:22.080> fold

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
use those creases to use another fold

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.310 
use those creases to use another fold
later<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:24.180> now<00:03:24.420> what's<00:03:24.630> going<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.780> happen<00:03:24.870> is

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
later so now what's going to happen is

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.920 
later so now what's going to happen is
we're<00:03:26.160> going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.340> take<00:03:26.550> one<00:03:26.910> flap<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.690> paper

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
we're going to take one flap of paper

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.840 
we're going to take one flap of paper
just<00:03:28.890> one<00:03:29.100> there's<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.370> couple<00:03:29.580> there's<00:03:29.760> a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
just one there's a couple there's a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.100 
just one there's a couple there's a
couple<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.180> different<00:03:30.420> spots<00:03:30.480> there<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:30.960> just

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
couple of different spots there but just

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.440 
couple of different spots there but just
open<00:03:31.380> up<00:03:31.410> one<00:03:31.470> flap<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.280> paper<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:32.760> what<00:03:33.360> we

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
open up one flap of paper and what we

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.630 
open up one flap of paper and what we
want<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.720> do<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:34.530> want<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.740> flatten<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.460> out

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
want to do is we want to flatten it out

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300 
want to do is we want to flatten it out
and<00:03:36.060> pick<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.630> up<00:03:36.810> as<00:03:36.960> high<00:03:37.350> as<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.800> and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
and pick it up as high as we can and

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.400 
and pick it up as high as we can and
when<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.820> pick<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.270> pretty<00:03:39.420> high<00:03:39.720> what's

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
when we pick it up pretty high what's

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.050 
when we pick it up pretty high what's
going<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.560> happen<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.010> these<00:03:41.190> two<00:03:41.490> outside

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
going to happen is these two outside

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.690 
going to happen is these two outside
flaps<00:03:42.510> are<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.800> want<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.070> work<00:03:44.460> their

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
flaps are going to want to work their

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.150 
flaps are going to want to work their
way<00:03:44.730> into<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.480> center<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.990> we've<00:03:46.950> already

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
way into the center and we've already

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.890 
way into the center and we've already
made<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.610> kite<00:03:47.880> fold<00:03:48.150> when<00:03:48.270> we<00:03:48.360> folded<00:03:48.720> this

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
made that kite fold when we folded this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.890 
made that kite fold when we folded this
over<00:03:49.230> we<00:03:49.740> already<00:03:50.010> sort<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.280> created<00:03:50.900> that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
over we already sort of created that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.870 
over we already sort of created that
fold<00:03:52.290> right<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.710> there<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.100> go<00:03:53.310> ahead<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.700> let

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
fold right in there so go ahead and let

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.700 
fold right in there so go ahead and let
the<00:03:54.030> paper<00:03:54.210> do<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.660> we're<00:03:55.290> going<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.470> pick

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
the paper do that we're going to pick

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.620 
the paper do that we're going to pick
the<00:03:55.830> paper<00:03:56.040> up<00:03:56.280> all<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:57.060> way<00:03:57.150> up<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.450> top

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
the paper up all the way up to the top

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.280 
the paper up all the way up to the top
and<00:03:57.980> pull<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.360> these<00:04:00.360> two<00:04:00.690> edges<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.230> is

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
and pull in these two edges this is

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:11.369 
and pull in these two edges this is
called<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.830> petal<00:04:02.160> fold<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.390> this

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.740 

you<00:04:12.379> see<00:04:12.590> how<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.800> flattens<00:04:13.310> out<00:04:13.489> nicely

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.210 

next<00:04:17.750> flip<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.350> paper<00:04:18.470> over<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.829> we<00:04:19.010> do<00:04:19.100> the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
next flip the paper over and we do the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.570 
next flip the paper over and we do the
same<00:04:19.250> thing<00:04:19.730> here<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:21.070> open<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.310> triangle

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
same thing here so open up that triangle

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.420 
same thing here so open up that triangle
open<00:04:23.540> up<00:04:23.630> these<00:04:23.780> two<00:04:23.930> flaps<00:04:24.229> fold<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.280> guy

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430

open up these two flaps fold this guy
back<00:04:25.610> down<00:04:26.080> we're<00:04:27.080> going<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.260> pick<00:04:27.440> up<00:04:28.090> this

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
back down we're going to pick up this

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.820 
back down we're going to pick up this
panel<00:04:29.540> right<00:04:29.660> here<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:29.990> do<00:04:30.380> another<00:04:30.560> petal

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
panel right here and do another petal

it should match the one behind it just

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.620 
it should match the one behind it just
like<00:04:39.979> that<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.370> this<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:40.970> called<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.419> crane

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
like that and this is called the crane

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.360 
like that and this is called the crane
base<00:04:41.870> now<00:04:42.500> once<00:04:42.710> we<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.979> crane<00:04:43.190> base

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
base now once we have the crane base

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.740 
base now once we have the crane base
make<00:04:43.669> sure<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.000> have<00:04:44.090> these<00:04:44.210> two<00:04:44.270> slits

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.060 
make sure that you have these two slits
right<00:04:44.930> here<00:04:45.080> at<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.350> bottom<00:04:45.710> these<00:04:45.830> are<00:04:45.919> going

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
right here at the bottom these are going

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.879 
right here at the bottom these are going
to<00:04:46.130> be<00:04:46.220> our<00:04:46.340> tail<00:04:46.850> in<00:04:47.030> our<00:04:47.120> head<00:04:47.770> what<00:04:48.770> we're

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
to be our tail in our head what we're

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.060 
to be our tail in our head what we're
going<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.040> do<00:04:49.190> is<00:04:49.430> we're<00:04:49.580> going<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:49.729> do<00:04:49.820> two

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
going to do is we're going to do two

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.110 
going to do is we're going to do two
kite<00:04:52.070> folds<00:04:52.100> we're<00:04:52.520> going<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:52.700> thin<00:04:52.910> this

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
kite folds we're going to thin this

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.310 
kite folds we're going to thin this
again<00:04:53.389> so<00:04:53.540> go<00:04:53.720> ahead<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:53.900> take<00:04:54.050> these<00:04:54.260> two

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
again so go ahead and take these two

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.020 
again so go ahead and take these two
edges<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:54.889> bring<00:04:55.070> those<00:04:55.190> into<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:55.760> middle

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
edges and bring those into the middle

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.990 
edges and bring those into the middle
and<00:04:57.010> make<00:04:58.010> sure<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.400> edges<00:04:58.550> are<00:04:58.820> there

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
and make sure that the edges are there

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.200 
and make sure that the edges are there
pointing<00:04:59.450> down<00:05:00.040> towards<00:05:01.040> here<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:01.430> don't<00:05:01.729> fold

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
pointing down towards here so don't fold

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.909 
pointing down towards here so don't fold
them<00:05:02.389> where<00:05:02.510> they<00:05:02.600> go<00:05:02.690> up<00:05:02.810> like<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.169> they're

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
them where they go up like that they're

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.540

we're<00:05:36.380> going<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.530> use<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.950> crease<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:37.400> we

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
we're going to use that crease that we

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.520 
we're going to use that crease that we
made<00:05:37.729> to<00:05:38.479> do<00:05:38.600> what's<00:05:38.780> called<00:05:38.930> an<00:05:39.080> inside

instead of taking this flap in front or
even<00:05:44.570> if<00:05:44.900> we<00:05:45.020> were<00:05:45.080> to<00:05:45.200> fold<00:05:45.350> it<00:05:45.440> behind<00:05:45.680> we're

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
even if we were to fold it behind we're

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.159 
even if we were to fold it behind we're
going<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.160> open<00:05:46.669> this<00:05:46.940> panel<00:05:47.450> up<00:05:47.600> right<00:05:47.900> here

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
going to open this panel up right here

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.779 
going to open this panel up right here
there's<00:05:48.440> two<00:05:48.650> panels<00:05:49.070> right<00:05:49.220> there<00:05:49.430> open<00:05:49.669> them

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
there's two panels right there open them

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.089 
there's two panels right there open them
up<00:05:49.850> and<00:05:50.419> we're<00:05:50.539> going<00:05:50.630> to<00:05:50.750> fold<00:05:50.960> this<00:05:51.169> in<00:05:51.710> the

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
up and we're going to fold this in the

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.680 
up and we're going to fold this in the
middle<00:05:52.460> of<00:05:52.639> them<00:05:52.849> we're<00:05:53.180> going<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.330> bring<00:05:53.570> it

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
middle of them we're going to bring it

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.110 
middle of them we're going to bring it
up<00:05:53.810> inside<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.680> middle<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.070> what<00:05:55.550> happens<00:05:55.910> is

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
up inside the middle and what happens is

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.469 
up inside the middle and what happens is
this<00:05:56.450> this<00:05:56.770> back<00:05:57.770> spine<00:05:58.490> of<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:59.030> paper<00:05:59.240> right

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
this this back spine of the paper right

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.440 
this this back spine of the paper right
here<00:05:59.599> is<00:05:59.780> going<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.050> reverse<00:06:00.849> its<00:06:01.849> crease<00:06:02.240> so

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
here is going to reverse its crease so

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.879 
here is going to reverse its crease so
now<00:06:02.660> it<00:06:02.960> switched<00:06:03.380> around<00:06:05.380> you<00:06:06.380> see<00:06:06.560> how<00:06:06.680> it's

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
now it switched around you see how it's

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.600 
now it switched around you see how it's
gone<00:06:07.099> in<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.430> middle<00:06:08.330> of<00:06:08.510> the<00:06:09.289> paper<00:06:09.520> it's<00:06:10.520> an

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
gone in the middle of the paper it's an

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.980 
gone in the middle of the paper it's an
inside<00:06:10.910> reverse<00:06:11.210> fold<00:06:11.479> when<00:06:11.630> we<00:06:11.690> do<00:06:11.780> that<00:06:11.870> on

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
inside reverse fold when we do that on

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.620 
inside reverse fold when we do that on
both<00:06:12.229> sides<00:06:12.289> and<00:06:12.979> try<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:13.910> do<00:06:14.060> it<00:06:14.180> on<00:06:14.300> the

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
both sides and try to do it on the

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.200 
both sides and try to do it on the
creases<00:06:15.020> we<00:06:15.139> just<00:06:15.410> made<00:06:15.669> when<00:06:16.669> we<00:06:16.789> folded<00:06:17.090> this

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
creases we just made when we folded this

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.590 
creases we just made when we folded this
up<00:06:17.419> try<00:06:17.630> to<00:06:17.690> use<00:06:17.900> those<00:06:18.140> creases

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.350 

and<00:06:21.600> once<00:06:22.140> we<00:06:22.230> do<00:06:22.350> that<00:06:22.760> you<00:06:23.760> can<00:06:23.940> figure<00:06:24.270> out

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
and once we do that you can figure out

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.610 
and once we do that you can figure out
which<00:06:24.600> side<00:06:24.780> you<00:06:24.870> wanna<00:06:24.990> be<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.110> head<00:06:25.260> which<00:06:25.500> I

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
which side you wanna be the head which I

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.230 
which side you wanna be the head which I
do<00:06:25.740> wanna<00:06:25.860> be<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.010> tail<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.430> want<00:06:26.850> to<00:06:27.000> use<00:06:27.090> this

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
do wanna be the tail I want to use this

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.000 
do wanna be the tail I want to use this
guy<00:06:27.480> for<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.750> head<00:06:27.930> and<00:06:28.470> what's<00:06:28.860> going<00:06:28.980> to

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
guy for the head and what's going to

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
guy for the head and what's going to
happen<00:06:29.310> is<00:06:29.400> I'm<00:06:29.520> going<00:06:29.640> to<00:06:29.700> make<00:06:29.850> another

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
happen is I'm going to make another

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.520 
happen is I'm going to make another
inside<00:06:30.390> reverse<00:06:30.420> fold<00:06:30.870> just<00:06:30.990> sort<00:06:31.170> of<00:06:31.200> open<00:06:31.470> it

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
inside reverse fold just sort of open it

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:39.200 
inside reverse fold just sort of open it
up<00:06:31.680> and<00:06:31.910> fold<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:33.150> beak<00:06:33.330> down<00:06:35.600> like<00:06:36.600> that<00:06:38.210> it's

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
up and fold the beak down like that it's

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.060 
up and fold the beak down like that it's
again<00:06:39.450> it's<00:06:39.600> been<00:06:39.720> folded<00:06:40.110> on<00:06:40.290> the<00:06:40.320> inside<00:06:40.920> of

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
again it's been folded on the inside of

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.150 
again it's been folded on the inside of
the<00:06:41.160> paper<00:06:41.280> like<00:06:41.640> that<00:06:42.590> fold<00:06:43.590> down<00:06:43.680> each<00:06:44.010> of

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
the paper like that fold down each of

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.700 
the paper like that fold down each of
the<00:06:44.220> wings<00:06:47.330> that<00:06:48.330> is<00:06:49.070> the<00:06:50.070> origami<00:06:50.400> crane
