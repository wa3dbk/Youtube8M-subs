and nut next we need to install our
u-shaped<00:02:14.489> block<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.630> reason<00:02:15.989> for<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.410> is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
u-shaped block the reason for this is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680 
u-shaped block the reason for this is
that<00:02:17.099> we<00:02:17.280> don't<00:02:17.370> smash<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.910> corrugation<00:02:18.569> of
