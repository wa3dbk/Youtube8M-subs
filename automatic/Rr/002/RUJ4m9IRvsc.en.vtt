00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
right on top method feeder I placed a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.330 
right on top method feeder I placed a
few<00:01:16.490> pilots<00:01:16.850> on<00:01:16.970> top<00:01:17.149> of<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:18.680> I<00:01:18.979> placed<00:01:19.220> me

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
few pilots on top of it and I placed me

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.010 
few pilots on top of it and I placed me
feeder<00:01:19.549> on<00:01:19.759> top<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:20.149> at<00:01:20.299> all<00:01:20.450> times<00:01:20.689> I'll

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
feeder on top of it at all times I'll

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.120 
feeder on top of it at all times I'll
make<00:01:21.140> sure<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.380> looping<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.799> hook<00:01:21.920> length

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
make sure the looping the hook length

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.740 
make sure the looping the hook length
comes<00:01:22.399> out<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.610> base<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.060> feeder<00:01:23.270> that's

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
comes out the base of the feeder that's

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.179 
comes out the base of the feeder that's
really<00:01:24.170> important<00:01:24.619> because<00:01:24.710> when<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> fish

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
really important because when a fish

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.090 
really important because when a fish
picks<00:01:25.670> up<00:01:25.820> here<00:01:26.060> hook<00:01:26.689> bait<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.200> let's<00:01:27.770> see<00:01:27.950> it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
picks up here hook bait and let's see it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.380 
picks up here hook bait and let's see it
instantly<00:01:28.610> feels<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.060> weight<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.360> your

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
instantly feels the weight of your

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.149 
instantly feels the weight of your
method<00:01:29.689> feeder<00:01:29.899> rather<00:01:30.560> than<00:01:30.770> feeling<00:01:30.979> a
