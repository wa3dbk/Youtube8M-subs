00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 Hello everyone today, I want you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.160
 tell about the washing machine 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.000
 manufacturing company kanye 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.150
 There are a number of features most probably 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.520
 the main thing is a small depth of washing 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.939
 the machine when loading it all round 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 the depth is only 40 centimeters 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.590
 when you have a small room but you want 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
 on the washing machine large downloads 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.040
 because usually 7 kilogram 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.430
 cars go 60 centimeters deep 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.170
 this is but one of the few models 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 combining eyelids you can have more features and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.870
 big load the second feature is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 top of me and x power system 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.149
 what is it there goes separate 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.520
 container inside and in which it is washed away 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.020
 powder and under pressure start there 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 water in connection with this all this is mixed 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.739
 and prepare a separate powder solution and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.850
 water and already this cleaning solution 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.049
 start up then the drum start up then 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 drum in order not to be 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.740
 stirring directly the drum 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.229
 jump and was already ready soap solution 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.369
 this greatly affects the quality of the chairs and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.259
 actually allows already at say 60 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.140
 degrees is washed just as if 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.500
 you'll wash at 90 of your own 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.920
 programs this is bazhina is perfect 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.590
 20 µs of your blended fabric at 20 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.259
 degrees wash intensive wash with 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.170
 40 degrees 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.409
 super intense and 60 that's basically 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 left me a set of programs then goes 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.800
 faster washing by the way the only 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.150
 the car is still a personal moment 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.690
 how much I know which is possible 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:59.430
 Choosing short time choirs 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.160
 here you can 14 or 33 for 44 minutes 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 well, here is extra cotton 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.090
 synthetic hand wash wool 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:14.100
 delicate fabrics well and with whether fuji and just 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.230
 rinsing can be turned on at her 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.980
 large display on which everything 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.330
 all your steel settings are displayed 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.210
 also narrow-headed 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.850
 large charging port that is it on 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.300
 order more than his old 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.760
 cars 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.690
 located on top made for convenience 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.200
 not to bend over to the handle will do 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.670
 opens more and the boot window on 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.340
 mind remember load and unload 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.130
 dimensional things so that through the hatch is not 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.340
 pull that is they come in here 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.560
 so there goes back the inner 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.480
 device of the machine, in principle, what all 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.800
 the rest of the drum capacity 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.959
 increases precisely by 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.780
 romance more with me three boot hatch 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.390
 more and the drum is higher therefore only when 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.730
 40 centimeters placed there not 5 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.990
 kilogram and seven internal 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.980
 surface 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.560
 all stainless steel but one 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.640
 here on the surface there is 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.580
 such are the bubbles 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.400
 it is made for a smaller contribution from to them 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.120
 that is, the fabric during spinning is not so 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.710
 in contact with the holes in the drum and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.300
 more less wear so when you 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.610
 erase chokok on maximum 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.770
 temperature at the maximum at jimmy he 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.050
 you will live much more than 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.360
 if you don’t go there such a thing madara 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.190
 on her curved ribs for better 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.920
 mixing linen in which too 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.710
 nozzles are located through which 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.000
 the solution is fed directly 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.090
 in linen 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.070
 Well, now about the display itself and 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.350
 function that can be selected 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.550
 additionally everything can change 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.560
 check the temperature 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.510
 Well, of course you can only ask 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.810
 less, that is, if we leave 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.210
 60 we can supply 5040 that is, since 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.610
 we are comfortable 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.170
 changing spin speed can be changed 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.230
 also at any speed you are interested in 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.800
 there is an important mass delayed start 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.260
 goes and there is a choice of the level of pollution then 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.320
 eat if you put underwear think that 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.840
 it is not very dirty can be reduced 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.860
 pollution level 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.849
 that is, put dependencies on it 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.879
 respectively 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:46.469
 this time let's say you make less 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:49.319
 pollution level 1:39 if average 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:53.729
 two hours already goes by if strong then goes 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.889
 already 230 hours without extra still there 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.360
 full lock is convenient if you have 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.849
 Small children 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.409
 You can block the child already if 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.419
 will be suitable to press some 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.240
 the buttons twist something and the settings are not 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.369
 will knock down the prewash mode but 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.559
 it goes for heavily soiled laundry 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:11.819
 if the pro is so dirty that you need more 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.889
 pre-cycle 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.830
 little do the laundry then 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.860
 primary start blemish mode 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.129
 when you use any 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.139
 bleach stain remover 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:27.319
 Spin cancellation is usually with delicate 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.449
 some tissues are used 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.289
 I'll bring some synthetics which 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.269
 can not squeeze 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.409
 so that later there is not a few for me 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:39.689
 folds below are no allergy lessons 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.379
 good for allergy sufferers but essentially 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:45.629
 just an extra rinse for 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:49.349
 so that the powder is better released from 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:52.099
 linen and already accordingly as if by herself 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.349
 allergy long washing powder and already 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.990
 easier for people to desig 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:00.749
 easy ironing mode when underwear 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.419
 distributed so that it is smaller 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.169
 changed to a drum when you reach there 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.840
 no longer 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.270
 black folds like underwear 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.529
 after drying it will be much easier 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.080
 ironing and another feature which 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.909
 probably with such a load just 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.039
 necessary machine has a function 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:22.680
 weighing that is when you load 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.710
 the laundry here is such a badge 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.620
 which now shows the maximum 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:31.080
 the machine turns the drum over 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.539
 certain time and weighs linen 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.169
 which is loaded and depending on 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:39.330
 this also selects the washing time 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:43.620
 there is if the drum you loaded let's say 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.199
 half or one third car this 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.719
 determine and already take the amount of water 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.339
 as much as necessary but accordingly 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:54.719
 passed on need to regulate 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:57.810
 alone so as not to pour in 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:07:01.020
 there was no excess foaming and then 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.819
 Further, all this day I sat on my clothes 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.889
 that's all I wanted 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:07.589
 today tell if the video was you 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:11.360
 Useful like likes subscribe to
