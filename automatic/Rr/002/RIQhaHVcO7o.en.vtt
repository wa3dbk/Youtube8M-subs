00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.170
 hi everyone here magic word is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 today a little tutorial video so 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.750
 for imminent conflict mission as well 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.859
 for fable to do total sync 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.689
 must do this little guide 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 it's not going to be very dangerous because 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.680
 good this is a mission a 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.570
 total synchronization that may seem 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.420
 complicated so I wanted you the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.489
 present so you saw that I 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.559
 so took the poison finally I filled 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.329
 good bag of poison that is the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.140
 bag is improved since see that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.890
 I can have 5 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.629
 but it's only like that but in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420
 actually poison theory are not 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.800
 needed so we have been able to go to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 the boat there are grenadiers from umbria 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.640
 case this first guard and the grenadier 1 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.160
 it's the one who has the bag one that passes 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 so before grabbing the guy it takes 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.340
 of course wait for grenadiers 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.840
 because they pass you have seen that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.760
 springs behind two boats on the side he 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 there is no gun so I remember the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 total synchronization 1 do not need 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.129
 s' is marked on the boats and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.290
 to make an air murder on 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.700
 attic is really that it's finally 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 look pretty hot like this and you go 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.360
 see that we just get away 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.630
 should know a little how then do there 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.950
 I grabbed the first is both 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.460
 to strive with him by to be able to go 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 to post it behind is the cargo 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.479
 so the grenadier he makes a round 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.400
 at it passes him around the bar and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.650
 the aude the guard that I'm trying to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.299
 to work I'll go around 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.520
 of the goods size of the barrel and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.049
 small packages that are tied up so 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.439
 we wait quietly in the corner 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.640
 to assassinate him 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.630
 now we're waiting for the grain and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.060
 true leads out that he is there he is in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 watch it's sure to ponlat there 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.360
 he started to move and so led 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 then see climbing on the mast will be able to him 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 to do year nothing so there must be done 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.470
 a little bit guys this is what is the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 la France 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.610
 then it's going to be annoying because 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.750
 guys saw me so 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.860
 there is a white thing that wants 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.180
 to say that they are mob serving 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.189
 by the way it does not know what's going on 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.380
 happening they are observing the 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.820
 grenadier continues his range so by 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.920
 precaution I poisoned so they are 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.689
 three you see we need even if 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.670
 we all want to neutralize them 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.190
 4-4 poisoned darts are enough 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.269
 so here it is good so you are who 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.470
 will be asked but in fact they stop 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.670
 do you directly suspect what 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.940
 because they are concerned about one of 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.569
 other 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.030
 the grenadier right there and so from here we 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.799
 can air dufferin so you see in 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.690
 do it just fill your your 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.290
 sack of fact I was imprisoned and 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.940
 that's enough 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.100
 but that's as a precaution 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 if not actually in during his round 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.910
 normal you can kill the grenadiers 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.739
 normally because he comes to post himself 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.330
 just in front of the bar and we just have 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.120
 since tomorrow to make an assassination 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.090
 acrobatic actually good there again I 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.380
 centralize everything is pretty cool so 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.760
 it depends on boat prove his juices and 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.380
 left when you arrive so 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.330
 basin opposite in front of the city that 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.980
 so is and charleston 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.959
 if I'm not mistaken then we can 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.380
 follow the small boat alley to go 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.850
 to the second ship so 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.100
 the device I'm going to the side where there is 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.510
 no cannon that fascinates really 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.010
 really things else why 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.410
 of hihat the outfit I wear 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:20.200
 it must be boring of Estonia so here 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.790
 there I go down the boat from below and we 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.160
 will be watching the patrols a bit because 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.510
 that it's pretty complicated there so this 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.370
 this time to more than murder to do 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.410
 so in fact the goal is to be tests 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.579
 of cars to go and spot and go 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.170
 activate the powder that is right in front 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.930
 so see there is an officer in front 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.420
 which enamelled the same and his 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.069
 symmetrical 1 on that side so that's it 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.989
 a lot more galley I think we have to 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.340
 power had if we kept all the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.410
 records of poisoning if not done at 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.910
 poison angers more possible but that's 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.850
 not the bm what you see I'm 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.100
 right in front of them 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.910
 Cargo powder from where it takes 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.070
 blow up the boat 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.900
 so we wait for the file to pass and 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.780
 it's really really time but 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.880
 to succeed you have to walk fast there I support 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.100
 on round his pose and there you guys do not 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.690
 not detect to his demons detected but 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.910
 the net tonnage off ticket so it's not 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.100
 spotted so there the boat will exhibit in 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.360
 either I'm still blurry we just wait 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.520
 that the explosion kills all the guys in 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.410
 same time doggie who come where 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.870
 L was 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.470
 so we did not find the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.690
 two boats exploded and now 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.540
 you have to climb up to hoist the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.610
 memory terminal flag so you 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.140
 see that in the end it looks like 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.850
 I think it's one of the most 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.620
 hard anyway if you want me I 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.890
 will make a guide for the following memory 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.810
 1 which consists of finally without spoil 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.920
 oh yes if you watch this video I 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.940
 think if you've already done the game 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.950
 you know it's a hard blow but 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.710
 bong in memory just after it takes 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.760
 murdered pitcairn I can find the 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.770
 very hard sync but she is 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.970
 interesting to play here so if you 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.970
 I want to suggest it to you 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.330
 because it takes already like co so here 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.140
 golden year beginning dead I have not shown 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.230
 beginning still is made must 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.820
 cross the city without crossing the 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.320
 city â€‹â€‹without taking any damage I 'm not going 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.120
 show because I finally design I have 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.890
 found no difficulty that I got 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.800
 never took a damage h to steal their done 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.120
 so there is no concern for the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.960
 next mission do not get caught 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.010
 guys who have prepared the field of 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.900
 battle and a little bit more complicated 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.550
 and that's gore bless america will emit 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.260
 read boats we send messages 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.930
 to potsdam we managed 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.040
 we make a jump from the angel since 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.410
 apparently it's called like that 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.970
 now in the water yes it's more 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.100
 top of the time sent you and we have 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.470
 ended the impending conflict we no longer 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.360
 than to swim to the east shore of the 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.520
 next mission so it will be 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.479
 we go back to the shelter of firms so 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.039
 thank you for watching this video 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.289
 I hope you enjoyed it or 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.009
 unless it helped you and I'll help you 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.009
 say to the next
