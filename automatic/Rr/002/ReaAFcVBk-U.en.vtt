coming<00:03:55.790> from<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:56.090> USB<00:03:56.510> port<00:03:56.810> right<00:03:57.410> here<00:03:57.560> it's

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
coming from the USB port right here it's

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.330 
coming from the USB port right here it's
got<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.190> little<00:03:58.360> box<00:03:59.470> that<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:02.090> runs<00:04:02.660> off<00:04:02.930> of

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
got this little box that it runs off of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.460 
got this little box that it runs off of
you<00:04:04.340> can<00:04:04.520> see<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.760> box<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.330> actually<00:04:05.780> velcroed

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
you can see the box I actually velcroed

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.320 
you can see the box I actually velcroed
it<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.740> side<00:04:06.980> right<00:04:07.220> here<00:04:07.520> so<00:04:08.090> it's<00:04:08.210> just

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
it to the side right here so it's just

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.790 
it to the side right here so it's just
not<00:04:08.480> all<00:04:08.600> in<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.840> way<00:04:08.990> hanging<00:04:09.290> around<00:04:09.650> and

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
not all in the way hanging around and

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.170 
not all in the way hanging around and
stuff<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.220> that's<00:04:10.460> a<00:04:10.760> pretty<00:04:10.970> good<00:04:11.150> idea<00:04:11.270> to<00:04:11.570> do

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.719 

so<00:04:18.180> that's<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.479> video<00:04:21.259> blue<00:04:22.259> tube<00:04:22.530> music<00:04:23.370> that

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
so that's the video blue tube music that

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.149 
so that's the video blue tube music that

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
hole right in there where where it is i

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:58.909 
hole right in there where where it is i
kind<00:05:57.899> of<00:05:57.930> drilled<00:05:58.169> a<00:05:58.229> hole<00:05:58.259> right<00:05:58.409> through<00:05:58.649> Dan

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
kind of drilled a hole right through Dan

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.860 
kind of drilled a hole right through Dan
so<00:05:59.069> I<00:05:59.129> can<00:05:59.310> stick<00:05:59.610> my<00:05:59.639> core<00:06:00.000> through<00:06:00.240> here<00:06:00.449> and

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
right in the cubby hole and then just

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.100

it right in the cubby hole so that was

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.350 
it right in the cubby hole so that was
pretty<00:06:13.349> cool<00:06:13.589> pretty<00:06:13.889> dope<00:06:14.159> I<00:06:14.430> guess<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.270> only

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
pretty cool pretty dope I guess the only

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.709 
pretty cool pretty dope I guess the only
thing<00:06:15.509> I<00:06:15.779> didn't<00:06:16.050> show<00:06:16.169> on<00:06:16.319> here<00:06:16.529> is<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:17.069> arm

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
thing I didn't show on here is the arm

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.260 
thing I didn't show on here is the arm
the<00:06:18.719> backup<00:06:19.139> cam<00:06:19.379> which<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:19.949> got<00:06:20.069> to<00:06:20.189> put<00:06:20.520> put

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
the backup cam which you got to put put

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.579 
the backup cam which you got to put put
it<00:06:21.360> in<00:06:21.449> reverse<00:06:21.539> and<00:06:21.779> soon<00:06:22.199> as<00:06:22.289> you<00:06:22.349> put<00:06:22.500> in

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:22.589 
it in reverse and soon as you put in

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.639 
it in reverse and soon as you put in
reverse<00:06:22.889> that's<00:06:23.430> when<00:06:23.729> it<00:06:23.819> comes<00:06:24.029> on<00:06:24.180> so

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:24.649 
reverse that's when it comes on so

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:28.249 
reverse that's when it comes on so
that's<00:06:25.649> pretty<00:06:25.860> cool<00:06:26.120> my<00:06:27.120> advice<00:06:27.479> is<00:06:27.509> get<00:06:28.080> out

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
that's pretty cool my advice is get out

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.020 
that's pretty cool my advice is get out
all<00:06:28.409> the<00:06:28.529> things<00:06:28.769> that<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:28.949> need<00:06:29.159> a<00:06:29.219> front

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
all the things that you need a front

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.900 
all the things that you need a front
and<00:06:30.420> it's<00:06:30.750> less<00:06:30.930> for<00:06:31.110> you<00:06:31.170> to<00:06:31.260> do<00:06:31.440> I<00:06:31.910> didn't

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
and it's less for you to do I didn't

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.080 
and it's less for you to do I didn't
install<00:06:33.210> it<00:06:33.390> myself<00:06:33.480> but<00:06:34.850> installation<00:06:35.850> seems

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
install it myself but installation seems

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.270 
install it myself but installation seems
like<00:06:36.240> it's<00:06:36.390> pretty<00:06:36.420> easy<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:37.260> did<00:06:37.830> have<00:06:38.010> to<00:06:38.040> go

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
like it's pretty easy I did have to go

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.600 
like it's pretty easy I did have to go
back<00:06:38.490> into<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:40.020> UM<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.710> screen<00:06:40.950> so<00:06:41.070> i<00:06:41.160> ended

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
back into the UM the screen so i ended

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.520 
back into the UM the screen so i ended
up<00:06:41.730> actually<00:06:41.940> doing<00:06:42.300> a<00:06:42.330> lot<00:06:42.450> of<00:06:42.530> installation

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
up actually doing a lot of installation

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.930 
up actually doing a lot of installation
stuff<00:06:43.740> myself<00:06:43.980> because<00:06:44.520> when<00:06:44.640> i<00:06:44.700> took<00:06:44.760> it

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
stuff myself because when i took it

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.700 
stuff myself because when i took it
again<00:06:45.240> installed<00:06:45.630> they<00:06:46.110> hooked<00:06:46.350> some<00:06:46.500> wires

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
again installed they hooked some wires

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.260 
again installed they hooked some wires

the<00:07:01.890> wires<00:07:02.070> around<00:07:02.280> so<00:07:02.730> installation<00:07:03.630> seems

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
the wires around so installation seems

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.630 
the wires around so installation seems
like<00:07:03.990> it's<00:07:04.170> pretty<00:07:04.380> fairly<00:07:04.680> easy<00:07:04.980> is<00:07:05.220> really<00:07:05.490> a
