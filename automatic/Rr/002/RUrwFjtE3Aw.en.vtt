bass<00:00:18.840> guitar<00:00:19.320> equipped<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.109> the<00:00:22.109> hex

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
bass guitar equipped with the the hex

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.080 
bass guitar equipped with the the hex
actually<00:00:23.100> saw<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> hex<00:00:23.490> pickup<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.939> guess

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
actually saw the hex pickup I guess

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.429 
actually saw the hex pickup I guess
would<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> quad<00:00:24.660> pickup<00:00:25.080> because<00:00:25.170> there's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
would be a quad pickup because there's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.160 
would be a quad pickup because there's
four<00:00:25.619> pickups<00:00:25.949> there<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.599> bridge<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
four pickups there in the the bridge and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
four pickups there in the the bridge and
this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> sound<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> bass<00:00:30.060> by

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
this is just the sound of the bass by

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.290 
this is just the sound of the bass by
itself

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.000 

and<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.920> turn<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:37.410> synthesizer<00:00:38.410> mix<00:00:38.740> blend

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
and we turn the synthesizer mix blend

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.760 
and we turn the synthesizer mix blend
knob<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.640> we<00:00:39.670> can<00:00:39.910> hear<00:00:40.120> some<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.770> base

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
knob and we can hear some of the base

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:52.080 
knob and we can hear some of the base
effect<00:00:42.130> come<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.309> that's<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.670> sound<00:00:51.879> of

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
effect come in and that's the sound of

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.979 
effect come in and that's the sound of
the<00:00:52.210> gr<00:00:52.540> 33<00:00:53.140> B<00:00:53.430> bass<00:00:54.430> guitar<00:00:55.090> synthesizer<00:00:55.660> so

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
the gr 33 B bass guitar synthesizer so

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.380 
the gr 33 B bass guitar synthesizer so
on<00:00:56.200> the<00:00:56.440> on<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:57.160> bass<00:00:57.309> guitar<00:00:57.340> itself<00:00:58.059> you

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
on the on the bass guitar itself you

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.770 
on the on the bass guitar itself you
have<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.600> filter<00:00:59.230> cutoff<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.570> have

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
have a filter cutoff and you have

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.710 
have a filter cutoff and you have
resonance<00:01:05.650> let's<00:01:06.220> see

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
resonance let's see

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.100 
resonance let's see
you're<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:09.250> while<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.880> also<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.630> g77<00:01:16.630> has

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
you're a while and also the the g77 has

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.390 
you're a while and also the the g77 has
touch<00:01:17.410> pads<00:01:17.710> for<00:01:18.040> vibrato<00:01:18.580> so<00:01:18.940> we'll<00:01:19.180> do<00:01:19.360> that

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.110 

all<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:26.450> got<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.750> do<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:27.550> touch<00:01:28.550> either<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
all you got to do is touch either the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.480 
all you got to do is touch either the
top<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.750> pad<00:01:30.020> or<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.620> bottom<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.280> pad

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
top of the pad or the bottom of the pad

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.470 
top of the pad or the bottom of the pad
and<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.850> vibrato<00:01:32.150> effect<00:01:32.630> will<00:01:32.780> kick<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:35.920> as<00:01:37.480> a

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
and the vibrato effect will kick in as a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.330 
and the vibrato effect will kick in as a
side<00:01:38.900> note<00:01:39.170> if<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:39.470> are<00:01:39.530> familiar<00:01:39.680> with<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
side note if you are familiar with the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.500 
side note if you are familiar with the
rollin<00:01:41.060> g-33<00:01:41.810> or<00:01:42.050> g<00:01:42.350> 88<00:01:42.740> bass<00:01:43.310> or<00:01:43.580> any<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.420> the

rollin g-33 or g 88 bass or any of the
guitar<00:01:44.870> series<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.380> touch<00:01:45.590> pads<00:01:45.860> are<00:01:46.010> a

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
guitar series the touch pads are a

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.270 
guitar series the touch pads are a
little<00:01:46.190> bit<00:01:46.340> different<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.830> on<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:49.070> bass

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
little bit different on the on this bass

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.390 
little bit different on the on this bass
guitar<00:01:49.310> on<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.780> other<00:01:51.320> guitars<00:01:51.800> one<00:01:52.160> touch

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
guitar on the other guitars one touch

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.180 
guitar on the other guitars one touch
pad<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:53.030> for<00:01:53.270> temporary<00:01:53.870> modulation<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.130> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
pad is for temporary modulation and the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.150 
pad is for temporary modulation and the
other<00:01:55.310> touch<00:01:55.520> pad<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.619> permanently<00:01:57.619> engage

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
other touch pad is to permanently engage

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.510 
other touch pad is to permanently engage
the<00:01:58.430> modulation<00:01:58.910> on<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.690> g77<00:02:00.470> they<00:02:01.130> wired

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
the modulation on the g77 they wired

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.430 
the modulation on the g77 they wired
them<00:02:01.729> up<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.450> only<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:03.080> temporary

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
them up so that it's only a temporary

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.160 
them up so that it's only a temporary
modulation<00:02:04.340> effect<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.030> when<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:05.840> first<00:02:06.050> got

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
modulation effect and when I first got

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.810 
modulation effect and when I first got
it<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.470> wondered<00:02:06.830> if<00:02:06.950> there<00:02:07.400> was<00:02:07.550> something

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
it I wondered if there was something

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.130 
it I wondered if there was something
wrong<00:02:07.850> with<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.149> bass<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:08.660> when<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.869> checked

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
wrong with the bass but when I checked

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.080 
wrong with the bass but when I checked
the<00:02:09.260> schematic<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:09.950> can<00:02:10.550> see<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.880> both<00:02:11.030> of

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
the schematic I can see that both of

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.960 
the schematic I can see that both of
these<00:02:11.330> pads<00:02:11.630> are<00:02:11.930> wired<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> same<00:02:12.880> part<00:02:13.880> of

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
these pads are wired to the same part of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.940 
these pads are wired to the same part of
the<00:02:14.060> circuit<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.600> that's<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.900> temporary<00:02:15.470> effect

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the circuit so that's a temporary effect

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.360 
the circuit so that's a temporary effect
only<00:02:16.220> which<00:02:16.520> maybe<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.000> was<00:02:17.980> bass<00:02:18.980> players

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
only which maybe that was bass players

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.130 
only which maybe that was bass players
complaining<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.300> modulation<00:02:20.780> just

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
complaining that the modulation just

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.840 
complaining that the modulation just
wouldn't<00:02:21.410> cut<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.890> off<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.459> this<00:02:22.640> bass

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
wouldn't cut on and off so on this bass

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.330 
wouldn't cut on and off so on this bass
it's<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:24.230> only<00:02:24.260> hear<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.709> LFO<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.130> you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
it's a you only hear the LFO and you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.420 
it's a you only hear the LFO and you
actually<00:02:25.700> touch<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.030> pad

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.830 

and<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.700> have<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.209> course<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
and then you have of course the the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.790 
and then you have of course the the
master

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.850 

now<00:02:39.670> master<00:02:40.240> volume<00:02:40.450> control<00:02:40.600> if<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.530> go<00:02:41.680> back

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
now master volume control if we go back

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.900 
now master volume control if we go back
over<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:43.060> base<00:02:43.270> side

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.240 

on<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.420> base<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.870> two<00:02:47.440> knobs<00:02:47.650> for<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
on the base you have two knobs for the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.460
