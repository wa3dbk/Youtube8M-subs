entirely from the back facing camera of
my<00:00:04.230> new<00:00:04.470> iphone<00:00:04.799> six-plus<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:06.180> it's<00:00:06.299> going<00:00:06.390> to

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
my new iphone six-plus so it's going to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.970 
my new iphone six-plus so it's going to
bring<00:00:06.629> around<00:00:06.750> here<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.259> mirror<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.890> you

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
bring around here to the mirror so you

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.980 
bring around here to the mirror so you
get<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> quick<00:00:08.309> little<00:00:08.580> look<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.750> 6

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
get a quick little look at that the 6

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.560 
get a quick little look at that the 6
plus<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.440> all<00:00:10.590> its<00:00:10.830> gigantic<00:00:11.460> glory<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.240> so

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
plus and all its gigantic glory I so

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.970 
plus and all its gigantic glory I so
it's<00:00:12.690> good<00:00:12.809> moving<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:13.440> bit<00:00:13.650> closer

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
it's good moving a little bit closer

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.740 
it's good moving a little bit closer
here<00:00:14.130> now<00:00:14.670> as<00:00:14.820> you've<00:00:15.030> seen<00:00:15.179> right<00:00:15.360> there<00:00:15.540> if

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
here now as you've seen right there if

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.870 
here now as you've seen right there if
you<00:00:15.870> notice<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.340> pulling<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
you notice that as I'm pulling in and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.400 
you notice that as I'm pulling in and
out<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.660> sounds<00:00:18.900> wrong

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
out here that sounds wrong

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.620 
out here that sounds wrong
it's<00:00:19.830> autofocusing<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.880> that's<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.330> new<00:00:21.420> feature

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
it's autofocusing I that's a new feature

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.050 
it's autofocusing I that's a new feature
only<00:00:21.960> iPhone<00:00:22.439> 6<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> 6-plus<00:00:23.160> camera<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.910> it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
only iPhone 6 and 6-plus camera is it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
only iPhone 6 and 6-plus camera is it
actually<00:00:24.330> has<00:00:24.390> autofocus<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.260> only<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.590> but

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
actually has autofocus not only that but

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
actually has autofocus not only that but
it's<00:00:25.920> faster<00:00:26.340> autofocus<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:27.420> got<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> new

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's faster autofocus it's got a new

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's faster autofocus it's got a new
sensor<00:00:28.080> which<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
sensor which is going to make the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.019 
sensor which is going to make the
autofocus<00:00:29.070> faster<00:00:29.519> which<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.789> you've<00:00:29.939> seen

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
autofocus faster which as you've seen

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.279 
autofocus faster which as you've seen
right<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.630> think<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.080> works<00:00:31.230> pretty

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
right there I think it works pretty

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.319 
right there I think it works pretty
great<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> then<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.369> also<00:00:32.579> got<00:00:32.790> another<00:00:33.090> new

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
great and then it's also got another new

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
great and then it's also got another new
feature<00:00:33.480> called<00:00:34.079> optic<00:00:34.590> image<00:00:34.860> stabilization

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
feature called optic image stabilization

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
feature called optic image stabilization
now<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> may<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.390> working<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.840> now

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
now you may see that working right now

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.100 
now you may see that working right now
by<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> way<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.860> works<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:39.030> gyroscope<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
by the way this works is a gyroscope and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.299 
by the way this works is a gyroscope and
the<00:00:40.260> accelerometer<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.070> phone<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the accelerometer and your phone is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
the accelerometer and your phone is
determining<00:00:42.120> how<00:00:42.300> you're<00:00:42.510> moving<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.899> phone

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
determining how you're moving your phone

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.569 
determining how you're moving your phone
and<00:00:43.379> while<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.860> recording<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> taking

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and while you're recording and taking

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.770 
and while you're recording and taking
pictures<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:45.149> looking<00:00:45.329> through<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> camera

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
pictures or looking through the camera

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
pictures or looking through the camera
whatever<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.620> lens<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.430> moving

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
whatever your lens is going to be moving

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.090 
whatever your lens is going to be moving
up<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.059> down<00:00:48.120> based<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.770> moving

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
up and down based on like how I'm moving

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.010 
up and down based on like how I'm moving
my<00:00:50.219> phone<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.969> try<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> keep<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> video<00:00:51.750> shot

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
my phone to try to keep the video shot

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
my phone to try to keep the video shot
as<00:00:52.199> stable<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.649> possible<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.399> I'm<00:00:53.670> inside

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
as stable as possible I know I'm inside

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.310 
as stable as possible I know I'm inside
right<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.660> an<00:00:54.750> idea<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
right now so you get an idea of how that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.910 
right now so you get an idea of how that
looks

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
looks

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.200 
looks
I'm<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.610> ahead<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.000> on

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
I'm gonna go ahead and take it on

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.689 
I'm gonna go ahead and take it on
outside<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> little

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
outside here I so we can get a little

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.299 
outside here I so we can get a little
quality<00:01:00.120> test<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.750> exactly<00:01:01.379> how<00:01:01.680> how<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
quality test of exactly how how the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.770 
quality test of exactly how how the
optic<00:01:02.699> image<00:01:02.940> stabilization<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
optic image stabilization is going to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.789 
optic image stabilization is going to
look<00:01:03.870> sorry<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> hear<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> shark<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
look sorry if you hear that shark in the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
do is kind of just walk through my yard

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.609 
do is kind of just walk through my yard
here<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.630> recording<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.320> normal

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
here not like I was recording a normal

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.200 
here not like I was recording a normal
video<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> feels<00:01:11.640> weird<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
video it's kind of feels weird because I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
video it's kind of feels weird because I
am<00:01:12.330> holding<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.689> gigantic<00:01:13.260> iPhone<00:01:13.619> six-plus

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
am holding a gigantic iPhone six-plus

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.100 
am holding a gigantic iPhone six-plus
it's<00:01:14.549> almost<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.210> bad<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.420> holding<00:01:15.780> an<00:01:15.840> iPad

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
bit I don't feel as bad doing it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.850 
bit I don't feel as bad doing it
