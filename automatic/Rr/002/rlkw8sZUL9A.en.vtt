00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
afterwards and it keeps it in good

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.039 
afterwards and it keeps it in good

don't all over it holds it like
hairspray<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.329> hairspray<00:01:45.570> at

hairspray I think it's like hairspray at
all<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.770> add<00:01:47.189> shine<00:01:47.520> oh<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
all I think it's just add shine oh and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.120 
all I think it's just add shine oh and
it<00:01:48.810> says<00:01:48.990> protect<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.500> hair<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:49.680> daily

and another thing got was this and I was

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.010 
and another thing got was this and I was
quite<00:02:17.410> as<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.710> was<00:02:17.890> quite<00:02:18.450> confused<00:02:19.450> when<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.870> did

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
quite as I was quite confused when I did

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.110 
quite as I was quite confused when I did
open<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:20.830> looks<00:02:21.070> like<00:02:21.160> lip

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
open it because it just looks like lip

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.330 
open it because it just looks like lip
gloss<00:02:22.390> or<00:02:22.630> whatever<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.800> says<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.190> a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
gloss or whatever but it says it's a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.430 
gloss or whatever but it says it's a
prime<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.210> crop<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.720> create<00:02:26.400> mixing<00:02:27.400> medium

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
