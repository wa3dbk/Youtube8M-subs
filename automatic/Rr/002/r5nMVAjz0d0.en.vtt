stove on a little later you walk into
the<00:00:58.530> kitchen<00:00:58.740> and<00:00:59.130> not<00:00:59.880> thinking<00:01:00.480> about<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the kitchen and not thinking about it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.410 
you take your hand and you rest it down
on<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> hot<00:01:03.960> burner<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> imagine

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
on the hot burner now you can imagine

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.200 
on the hot burner now you can imagine
with<00:01:06.840> me<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.920> point<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.939> not

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
with me that at this point you will not

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.030 
with me that at this point you will not
be<00:01:09.509> smiling<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.439> lady<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.890> this

be smiling like this lady in this
picture<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.730> matter<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.540> fact<00:01:12.840> you'll

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
picture as a matter of fact you'll

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.960 
picture as a matter of fact you'll
probably<00:01:13.260> look<00:01:13.980> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.730> this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
probably look a little more like this

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
probably look a little more like this
lady<00:01:15.300> but<00:01:15.750> let's<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.260> about<00:01:16.470> what's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
lady but let's think about what's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.840 
lady but let's think about what's
happening<00:01:17.190> right<00:01:17.250> now

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
happening right now

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030 
happening right now
there's<00:01:18.180> intense<00:01:18.930> stimulation<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.980> is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
there's intense stimulation that is

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
there's intense stimulation that is
sending<00:01:20.670> signals<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:21.930> spinal<00:01:22.230> cord<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
sending signals to your spinal cord and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
sending signals to your spinal cord and
to<00:01:22.980> your<00:01:23.190> brain

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
to your brain

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.060 
to your brain
they're<00:01:24.150> signals<00:01:24.720> sent<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.590> muscles

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
they're signals sent back to the muscles

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.950 
they're signals sent back to the muscles
in<00:01:26.220> your<00:01:26.250> arms<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.970> tell<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> muscles<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
in your arms that tell the muscles to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
in your arms that tell the muscles to
contract<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.460> pull<00:01:29.730> away<00:01:29.880> from

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
contract so that you can pull away from

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
contract so that you can pull away from
that<00:01:30.210> intense<00:01:30.840> stimulation<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.680> not

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that intense stimulation and not

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
that intense stimulation and not
experience<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> pain<00:01:33.030> anymore

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
experience the pain anymore

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
experience the pain anymore
there's<00:01:34.380> signals<00:01:34.980> being<00:01:35.190> interpreted<00:01:35.610> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
there's signals being interpreted in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.320 
there's signals being interpreted in
your<00:01:36.479> brain<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.080> immense<00:01:37.770> pain<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.240> are

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
your brain as immense pain so there are

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.390 
your brain as immense pain so there are
a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> signals<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.770> travelling

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a lot of signals that are travelling

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.940 
a lot of signals that are travelling
throughout<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:42.060> nervous<00:01:42.540> system<00:01:42.710> now<00:01:43.710> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
throughout your nervous system now that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
throughout your nervous system now that

specialized<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.570> send<00:02:00.990> signals

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
specialized in that they send signals

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.680 
specialized in that they send signals
throughout<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.280> body<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.510> that

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
throughout the body and they can do that

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.059 
throughout the body and they can do that
really<00:02:04.020> rapidly<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:07.020> animation<00:02:07.560> gives<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
really rapidly this animation gives you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.219 
really rapidly this animation gives you
an<00:02:08.190> idea<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.819> how<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.209> cells<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.929> send

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
an idea of how these cells can send

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110 
an idea of how these cells can send
signals<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.370> another<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.090> very

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
signals from one to another in a very

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.479 
signals from one to another in a very
rapid<00:02:12.810> way<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.170> actually<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.099> happens

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
rapid way and actually it happens

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.399 
rapid way and actually it happens
significantly<00:02:15.450> faster<00:02:15.749> than<00:02:15.989> what's

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
significantly faster than what's

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.959 
significantly faster than what's
depicted<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:19.040> let's<00:02:20.040> talk<00:02:20.310> about<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.700> for

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969

parts<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.870> neuron<00:02:22.190> first<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
parts of a neuron first we have the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.970 
parts of a neuron first we have the
dendrites<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.360> these<00:02:24.780> are<00:02:24.990> points<00:02:25.170> where<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
dendrites and these are points where the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.630 
dendrites and these are points where the
cell<00:02:26.220> receives<00:02:26.700> inputs<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:27.480> other<00:02:27.780> cells

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
cell receives inputs from other cells

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.790 
cell receives inputs from other cells
then<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.390> soma<00:02:30.720> or<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.050> cell<00:02:31.320> body

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
then we have the soma or the cell body

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.560 
then we have the soma or the cell body
and<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.520> part<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> neuron<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
and this is the part of the neuron that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.650 
and this is the part of the neuron that
is<00:02:33.750> most<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.470> any<00:02:34.770> other<00:02:35.040> cell<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:36.120> also<00:02:36.630> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
is most like any other cell it is also a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.780 
is most like any other cell it is also a
place<00:02:36.930> where<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.410> neuron<00:02:37.830> receives<00:02:38.190> input

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
place where the neuron receives input

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
place where the neuron receives input
and<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.450> place<00:02:39.720> where<00:02:39.960> there's<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> lot<00:02:40.530> of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and it's a place where there's a lot of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.710 
and it's a place where there's a lot of
processing<00:02:41.340> happening<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.360> find<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
processing happening you can find the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.380 
processing happening you can find the
nucleus<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.440> cell<00:02:43.640> inside<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> cell<00:02:44.940> body

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
nucleus of the cell inside the cell body

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.560 
nucleus of the cell inside the cell body
then<00:02:46.380> we<00:02:46.650> have<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> axon<00:02:47.460> which<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.180> where<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
then we have the axon which is where the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.050 
then we have the axon which is where the
signal<00:02:49.050> actually<00:02:49.340> originates<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.940> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
signal actually originates so that it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.140 
signal actually originates so that it
can<00:02:51.240> be<00:02:51.390> sent<00:02:51.780> all<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.500> way<00:02:52.590> down<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.610> axon

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
can be sent all the way down to the axon

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.660 
can be sent all the way down to the axon
terminals<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.260> axon<00:02:55.680> terminals<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.520> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
terminals and the axon terminals are the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.340 
terminals and the axon terminals are the
points<00:02:57.090> where<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.540> connects<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.110> other

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
points where it connects with other

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.650 
points where it connects with other
neurons<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.160> send<00:02:59.820> signals<00:03:00.090> through<00:03:00.510> those

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
neurons and send signals through those

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.470 
neurons and send signals through those
other<00:03:00.990> neurons<00:03:01.470> by<00:03:01.890> releasing

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
other neurons by releasing

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.460 
other neurons by releasing
neurotransmitter<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.690> we're<00:03:04.110> going<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.320> get

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
neurotransmitter and we're going to get

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.910 
neurotransmitter and we're going to get
into<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.310> later<00:03:05.520> tutorial<00:03:06.800> there<00:03:07.800> are

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
into that in a later tutorial there are

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.510 
into that in a later tutorial there are
three<00:03:08.310> main<00:03:08.760> types<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:09.390> neurons<00:03:10.340> first<00:03:11.340> we

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
three main types of neurons first we

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.370 
three main types of neurons first we
have<00:03:11.670> sensory<00:03:12.120> neurons<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.810> these<00:03:13.170> are

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
have sensory neurons and these are

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.830 
have sensory neurons and these are
neurons<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.920> send<00:03:14.040> signals<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.240> central

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
neurons that send signals to the central

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.780 
neurons that send signals to the central
nervous<00:03:16.020> system<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.680> if<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.340> remember<00:03:17.700> from

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
nervous system and if you remember from

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.700 
nervous system and if you remember from
the<00:03:17.880> previous<00:03:18.450> episode<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.200> central<00:03:19.560> nervous

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
the previous episode the central nervous

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.530 
the previous episode the central nervous
system<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.370> made<00:03:20.550> up<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.000> brain<00:03:21.270> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
system is made up of the brain and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.040 
system is made up of the brain and
spinal<00:03:21.780> cord<00:03:22.490> then<00:03:23.490> we<00:03:24.030> have<00:03:24.240> modern<00:03:24.540> neurons

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
spinal cord then we have modern neurons

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.440 
spinal cord then we have modern neurons
that<00:03:25.290> send<00:03:25.350> signals<00:03:26.130> away<00:03:26.640> from<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.030> central

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
that send signals away from the central

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.020 
that send signals away from the central
nervous<00:03:27.630> system<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.830> other<00:03:29.130> organs<00:03:29.790> and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
nervous system and to other organs and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.070 
nervous system and to other organs and
muscles<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.780> tissues<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.350> glands<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.580> on

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
muscles and tissues and glands and so on

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.900 
muscles and tissues and glands and so on
lastly<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:34.320> have<00:03:34.470> inter<00:03:34.890> neurons<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.520> these

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
lastly we have inter neurons and these

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.880 
lastly we have inter neurons and these
are<00:03:36.150> neurons<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.720> are<00:03:36.840> contained<00:03:37.320> fully

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
are neurons that are contained fully

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.130 
are neurons that are contained fully
within<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.940> central<00:03:39.360> nervous<00:03:39.510> system<00:03:39.720> so

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
within the central nervous system so

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.440 
within the central nervous system so
it's<00:03:40.440> within<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.950> brain<00:03:41.220> within<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.150> spinal

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
it's within the brain within the spinal

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.570 
it's within the brain within the spinal
cord<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.020> where<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> lot<00:03:43.770> of<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.980> processing

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
cord and where a lot of the processing

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
cord and where a lot of the processing
happens<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:47.160> illustrate<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.940> let's<00:03:48.270> imagine

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
happens to illustrate this let's imagine

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.140 
happens to illustrate this let's imagine
you're<00:03:48.959> being<00:03:49.200> touched<00:03:49.500> by<00:03:49.770> someone<00:03:50.070> or<00:03:50.400> as<00:03:50.940> in

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
you're being touched by someone or as in

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.590 
you're being touched by someone or as in
the<00:03:51.270> first<00:03:51.420> example<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.410> touch<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> hot<00:03:53.010> stove

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
the first example you touch a hot stove

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.940 
the first example you touch a hot stove
signals<00:03:54.600> are<00:03:54.750> going<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.959> be<00:03:55.050> sent<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.770> the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
signals are going to be sent to the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.100 
signals are going to be sent to the
central<00:03:56.310> nervous<00:03:56.459> system<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.630> happens

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
central nervous system and this happens

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.400 
central nervous system and this happens
via<00:03:58.410> sensory<00:03:59.250> neurons<00:03:59.790> then<00:04:00.570> let's<00:04:01.080> imagine

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
via sensory neurons then let's imagine

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.110 
via sensory neurons then let's imagine
you're<00:04:01.740> out<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.070> field<00:04:02.160> playing<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.910> game

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
you're out on the field playing a game

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.820 
you're out on the field playing a game
of<00:04:03.270> football<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.870> you're<00:04:04.200> getting<00:04:04.560> ready<00:04:04.740> to

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
of football and you're getting ready to

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.310 
of football and you're getting ready to
kick<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> ball<00:04:05.330> well<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.750> central<00:04:07.080> nervous

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
kick a ball well the central nervous

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.199 
kick a ball well the central nervous
system<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.950> sending<00:04:08.400> signals<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.180> muscles

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
system is sending signals to the muscles

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.080 
system is sending signals to the muscles
in<00:04:09.750> your<00:04:09.780> legs<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.860> does<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.310> via<00:04:11.730> motor

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
in your legs and it does that via motor

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.150 
in your legs and it does that via motor
neurons<00:04:12.600> telling<00:04:13.350> those<00:04:13.500> muscles<00:04:14.010> to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
neurons telling those muscles to

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.460 
neurons telling those muscles to
contract<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:15.209> certain<00:04:15.600> way<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.320> you

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
contract in a certain way so that you

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.770 
contract in a certain way so that you
can<00:04:16.500> kick<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.040> ball<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.520> of<00:04:18.150> course<00:04:18.450> there

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
can kick the ball and of course there

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.479 
can kick the ball and of course there
are<00:04:18.900> inter<00:04:19.260> neurons<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.100> brain<00:04:20.310> and

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
are inter neurons in the brain and

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.820 
are inter neurons in the brain and
spinal<00:04:20.609> cord<00:04:20.910> doing<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.930> processing<00:04:22.680> and

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
spinal cord doing the processing and

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.860 
spinal cord doing the processing and
also<00:04:23.490> serving<00:04:24.000> as<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> connection<00:04:24.630> between

secondly I spoke about the four main
parts<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:37.039> a<00:04:37.099> neuron<00:04:37.129> and<00:04:37.729> lastly<00:04:38.539> I<00:04:38.870> spoke

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
parts of a neuron and lastly I spoke

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.950 
parts of a neuron and lastly I spoke
about<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.919> three<00:04:40.190> types<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.729> neurons<00:04:40.970> that's

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
about the three types of neurons that's

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.050 
about the three types of neurons that's
it<00:04:42.169> for<00:04:42.409> today's<00:04:42.650> episode<00:04:42.860> I'll<00:04:43.400> see<00:04:43.849> you<00:04:43.970> on
