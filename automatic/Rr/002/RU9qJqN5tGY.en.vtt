00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
one of them appeared to be almost like

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.390 
one of them appeared to be almost like
he<00:03:22.140> was<00:03:22.230> obviously<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.860> he<00:03:23.010> has<00:03:23.130> his<00:03:23.310> little

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.330 
messages and they jot down notes or
communicating<00:03:39.480> stuff<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.739> can't<00:03:41.160> wait<00:03:41.280> to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
communicating stuff so I can't wait to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.500 
communicating stuff so I can't wait to
actually<00:03:41.670> play<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.820> game<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.239> see<00:03:42.360> how

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
actually play the game and see how

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.569 
actually play the game and see how
accurate<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:44.370> would<00:03:44.489> be

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
accurate that is but that would be

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.039 
accurate that is but that would be
pretty<00:03:44.760> cool<00:03:44.910> if<00:03:45.180> people<00:03:45.540> wanted<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.810> cosplay

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049

and<00:03:46.500> stuff<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.040> could<00:03:47.250> totally

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and stuff like that I could totally

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.490 
and stuff like that I could totally
imagine<00:03:47.579> people<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.180> be<00:03:48.239> cosplaying<00:03:48.500> carrying

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
imagine people to be cosplaying carrying
