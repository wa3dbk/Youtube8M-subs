00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.529
 hi how about 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.060
 I present to you I present my project 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.730
 hydroponic 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.299
 or it consists of 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.509
 of four tubes that are in shape 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.509
 horizontal 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.860
 with several holes 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.270
 with a space between each hole 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:29.320
 approximately 20 25 centimeters 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.770
 Now I just harvested and cut the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.350
 Cucumber bush that is grown if given 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.520
 account we have 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.850
 some centuries moored here 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.820
 to tie the guide of them 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.309
 of the cucumber on one occasion always 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.400
 also tomato in the moored so that 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.340
 grow up 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.110
 if they realize the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.950
 the little plant already has 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 flower 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.210
 and it is very green the bush is very healthy 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.250
 I got a little plague on some 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.089
 like in this bully pumpkin 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.089
 but there goes 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.890
 inside d 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.010
 inside each milk a little bit of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.920
 of volcanic earth 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.870
 I put it on this kind of land because it's 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.610
 very 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.220
 and keeps a lot of moisture 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 I also have a little sauce 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.640
 you do not want to do very well here 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.910
 but for the space that has reduced 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.910
 the river the tube we have epazote 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.090
 a bit of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.530
 of beans jotero 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.530
 the truth everything is giving very well 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.179
 the system has a boat 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.549
 of cheap cheap garbage 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.549
 Approximately 70 pesos 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.570
 if they realize they have the tubes they have 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.310
 a slope on this side here here 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.700
 base the water 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.739
 circulates on all those sides circulates 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.620
 circulate circulates until falling again in 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.260
 the boat in here inside the boat 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.230
 we have 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.700
 a bomb 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.700
 a pump for fish tank 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.520
 this bomb 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.030
 every certain time with a timer 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.860
 Pumping the water again 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.280
 here we have this side we have the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.280
 timer 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.460
 here is the timer 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 you have scheduled it, program it once 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.480
 once a day 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.560
 good 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.930
 it seems that that's all it has given me very 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.819
 good results at the beginning 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.629
 it's convenient down to the bottom of the tubes 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.090
 Throw a thicker sand 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:07.040
 that leaked a bit more after 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.040
 on top of another a thinner layer of sand 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.880
 well here we have another other bush of 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:20.080
 of tomato very beautiful because the truth 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.560
 others already harvest it as it is for 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.440
 personal consumption tried to throw him what 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.730
 least possible chemicals and least 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.830
 possible this 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.340
 some organic fertilizer like 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.840
 fertilizer we have on this side a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.150
 boat 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.030
 with leaves that I took from here 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.420
 past cucumbers that I am leaving to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.959
 rot so that later he can throw it out and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.800
 use it as a hydroponic fertilizer 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.330
 liquid fertilizer inside this container 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.910
 I also have this matte that is anti 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.910
 It is a natural pest repellent 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.190
 used the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.590
 the east 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.100
 these on those little envelopes 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.100
 that gives the day 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.150
 is this yemen garlic extract and 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.329
 chrysanthemums 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.940
 and then I try to use it all organic 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.720
 good he left us 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.720
 Thank you
