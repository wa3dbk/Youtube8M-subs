and Gaiman is pumping high he was he got
double<00:00:16.800> layer<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.310> means<00:00:17.460> he<00:00:17.640> could<00:00:17.820> be

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
double layer that means he could be

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.279 
double layer that means he could be
going<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> high<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.660> drop<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.050> he<00:00:19.109> is

going for a drop Damon is going for a
drop<00:00:21.600> build<00:00:21.869> he's<00:00:21.960> got<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.170> double<00:00:22.529> layer<00:00:22.680> so

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
drop build he's got this double layer so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.980 
drop build he's got this double layer so
we<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.310> upgrade<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.269> each<00:00:24.449> Overlord

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
we can upgrade one of each Overlord

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.349 
we can upgrade one of each Overlord
speed<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.500> Overlord<00:00:25.920> carrying<00:00:26.340> capacity<00:00:26.820> so

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
speed and Overlord carrying capacity so

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.910 
speed and Overlord carrying capacity so
we<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.019> sort<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> high<00:00:28.560> Jewish

see how this plays out these overloads

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.620 
see how this plays out these overloads
are<00:01:02.750> already<00:01:03.170> speed<00:01:03.410> upgraded<00:01:04.180> so<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.269> can<00:01:05.420> see

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
are already speed upgraded so we can see

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.060 
are already speed upgraded so we can see
the<00:01:05.810> whole<00:01:06.080> map<00:01:06.320> he's<00:01:06.560> gonna<00:01:06.650> be<00:01:06.800> able<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:06.950> see

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the whole map he's gonna be able to see

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.859 
the whole map he's gonna be able to see
this<00:01:07.220> drop<00:01:07.430> coming<00:01:07.729> 30<00:01:08.119> seconds<00:01:08.540> before<00:01:08.659> it

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
this drop coming 30 seconds before it

this drop coming 30 seconds before it
gets<00:01:08.990> in<00:01:09.080> his<00:01:09.170> base<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.830> that's<00:01:09.950> going<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.280> be

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
gets in his base and that's going to be

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.810 
gets in his base and that's going to be
a<00:01:10.369> huge<00:01:11.030> advantage<00:01:11.619> these<00:01:12.619> up<00:01:12.800> these<00:01:13.400> uploads

base by his gateways and four storms can
kill<00:01:25.940> about<00:01:26.060> 25<00:01:27.020> hydros<00:01:27.530> if<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.770> do<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.009> right

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
kill about 25 hydros if you do it right

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.170 
kill about 25 hydros if you do it right
storms<00:01:29.150> absolutely<00:01:30.080> murder<00:01:30.610> serve<00:01:31.610> clusters

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
storms absolutely murder serve clusters

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.650 
storms absolutely murder serve clusters
of<00:01:32.300> units<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:34.430> this<00:01:34.789> is<00:01:34.940> going<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.240> be<00:01:35.360> really

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
with them these overlords have to have

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.880 
with them these overlords have to have
units<00:01:50.300> in<00:01:50.420> them<00:01:50.570> there's<00:01:50.840> no<00:01:51.259> way<00:01:51.289> they<00:01:51.619> don't

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
units in them there's no way they don't

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.430 
units in them there's no way they don't

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
looks like he got quite a few though it

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.720 
looks like he got quite a few though it
looks<00:02:20.750> like<00:02:20.930> he<00:02:21.110> was<00:02:21.230> able<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.590> get<00:02:21.769> about<00:02:22.040> 10

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
looks like he was able to get about 10

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.940 
looks like he was able to get about 10
to<00:02:23.030> 20<00:02:23.480> drones<00:02:23.750> with<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.079> Templar<00:02:24.440> drop<00:02:24.680> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
to 20 drones with that Templar drop and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.910 
to 20 drones with that Templar drop and
that's<00:02:25.880> not<00:02:26.030> going<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.450> be<00:02:26.570> as<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.959> game<00:02:27.410> ender

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that's not going to be as a game ender

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.770 
that's not going to be as a game ender
but<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.370> gonna<00:02:28.549> be<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.700> game<00:02:28.940> changer<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
but that is gonna be a game changer and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780 
but that is gonna be a game changer and
uh

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
uh

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.759 
uh
these<00:02:32.420> overlords<00:02:33.080> obviously<00:02:33.440> don't<00:02:33.560> have

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
these overlords obviously don't have

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.990 
these overlords obviously don't have
anything<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.220> he's<00:02:34.400> just<00:02:34.519> using<00:02:34.700> them<00:02:34.970> for

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
anything and he's just using them for

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.119 
anything and he's just using them for
vision<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:35.989> did<00:02:36.230> hear<00:02:36.409> him<00:02:36.470> loading<00:02:37.040> up

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
vision but I did hear him loading up

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.490 
vision but I did hear him loading up
overlords<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.819> it's<00:02:38.629> very<00:02:38.930> interesting<00:02:39.290> that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
overlords and it's very interesting that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.640 
overlords and it's very interesting that
I<00:02:39.769> have<00:02:39.980> no<00:02:40.129> idea<00:02:40.400> where<00:02:40.580> they<00:02:40.640> went

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
I have no idea where they went

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.530 
I have no idea where they went
maybe<00:02:42.650> he<00:02:42.830> unloaded<00:02:43.610> them<00:02:43.849> defending<00:02:44.480> this

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
maybe he unloaded them defending this

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.300 
maybe he unloaded them defending this
drop<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.140> saw<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:45.890> he<00:02:45.980> just<00:02:46.010> couldn't

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
drop and saw it but he just couldn't

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.949 
drop and saw it but he just couldn't
quite<00:02:46.430> stop<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:48.560> choke<00:02:48.860> point

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
quite stop it and this choke point

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.280 
quite stop it and this choke point
we<00:02:50.959> got<00:02:51.110> nasty<00:02:51.519> Wow<00:02:52.549> nasties<00:02:53.269> pretty<00:02:53.870> much<00:02:54.049> max

Damon is at 89 and 158 APM so mass

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.900 
Damon is at 89 and 158 APM so mass
dragoon<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.690> coming<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.220> upgrades<00:03:07.220> are<00:03:07.489> 1

so upgrades are pretty much dead even

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.430 
so upgrades are pretty much dead even
but<00:03:20.420> nasty<00:03:21.349> is<00:03:21.470> maxed<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.750> Damon<00:03:23.750> has<00:03:23.989> 89

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.339 
but nasty is maxed and Damon has 89
supply<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.129> that<00:03:25.879> tempo<00:03:26.599> drop<00:03:26.870> did<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.140> lot<00:03:27.319> more

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
supply so that tempo drop did a lot more

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.809 
supply so that tempo drop did a lot more
damage<00:03:27.590> than<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.040> thought<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.340> he<00:03:28.519> must<00:03:28.670> have

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
damage than I thought it he must have

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.339 
damage than I thought it he must have
killed<00:03:28.940> about<00:03:29.180> 30<00:03:29.420> or<00:03:29.599> 40<00:03:29.629> drones<00:03:30.200> that

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
killed about 30 or 40 drones that

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.800 
killed about 30 or 40 drones that

Templar and that is HUGE that could be

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.240 
Templar and that is HUGE that could be
