you<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> lot<00:00:25.050> more<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> that's<00:00:26.250> how<00:00:26.430> i<00:00:26.460> feel

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
look out for with this game is that I
think<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.030> graphics<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.750> me<00:01:12.930> very

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
think the graphics are me very

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.310 
think the graphics are me very
underrated<00:01:14.010> until<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.790> go<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.240> close<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.869> think

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
underrated until you go up close I think

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.690

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
Durant screen job put that in right now

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.490 
Durant screen job put that in right now
on<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.790> pc<00:01:21.270> version<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> sweat<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
on the pc version where the sweat you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960 
on the pc version where the sweat you
could<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:22.950> trickling<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.670> his<00:01:23.700> face

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.320 
could just see trickling down his face
and<00:01:24.210> looks<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.110> good<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.299> graphically<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and looks just so good and graphically I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.620 
and looks just so good and graphically I
think<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.840> game<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.509> from<00:01:30.509> an

think this game from just from an

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.179 
think this game from just from an
immediate<00:01:31.140> standpoint<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:32.009> look<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
immediate standpoint you don't look a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.300 
immediate standpoint you don't look a
lot<00:01:32.369> better<00:01:32.579> than<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> complete

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
lot better than just from the complete

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.350 
lot better than just from the complete
