Derrick Rose arguably is just as good if
not<00:03:04.120> better<00:03:04.300> than<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.780> Wayne<00:03:04.900> wave<00:03:05.110> right<00:03:05.290> now

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
not better than to Wayne wave right now

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.710 
not better than to Wayne wave right now
a<00:03:05.680> lot<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:05.980> people<00:03:06.070> will<00:03:06.340> say<00:03:06.490> okay<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.510> can

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
a lot of people will say okay you can

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.860 
a lot of people will say okay you can
argue<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.550> got<00:03:09.700> boozer<00:03:10.180> who<00:03:10.810> is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
argue that and you got boozer who is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.330 
argue that and you got boozer who is
probably<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:11.320> as<00:03:11.470> good<00:03:11.620> as<00:03:11.740> Bosh<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.160> not

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340
