with you know toothpicks or you could
use<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> skewer<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.600> when<00:01:37.350> you're<00:01:37.500> actually

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
use a skewer is when you're actually

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
use a skewer is when you're actually
serving<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> kids<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> make
