00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.690
 bucket number 21 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.130
 and in it I would not like to talk about working with 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.419
 clipboard ajax 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.589
 The press provides two components for 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.699
 work with clipboard 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.800
 one of them is on the system tab 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 in the group of components here it is the very first 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.720
 the other is on the control tab 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.349
 and called like any taste 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.359
 first look at the first company he 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.070
 can bring 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.320
 clipboard text picture 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 and getting them 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.510
 and clipboard 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.340
 for this he has two methods for 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.350
 entering text and pictures 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.580
 and where are the four properties 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.930
 as well as data points for transmission to them 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.930
 copying the layout cut down pictures 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.330
 prime will 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
 very simple 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 we just copy the text 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.720
 those views give back to the stick of data 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 here from this field 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.250
 and then 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.170
 using another button and another field 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.820
 just set 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 this text 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.420
 here we copied the text 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.460
 and paste it 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.540
 just as you can use 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 copy receive picture 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.810
 Pierre look at the components of the board Cook 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.280
 this component 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.780
 but also intended for postponing 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.090
 change big problems 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.350
 gives the appropriate 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.200
 developments 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 one event happens yes 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.760
 the clipboard is entered in the text 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.410
 second when the picture 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.009
 With the help of new methods you can 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.229
 the first method puts the text exactly the same 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.229
 claws previous component see 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.659
 and here is the second method 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.619
 low grade work 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.279
 and leaves the text from the clipboard 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.389
 out the window 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.689
 set identifiers 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.819
 here you can transfer 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.819
 ids 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.189
 but there are some parameters 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.189
 which in principle is clear from the description 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.639
 set an experiment like this 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.199
 with this component 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.309
 long-term search from which we will 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.889
 copy text 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.889
 this field is not connected anywhere 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.249
 and the company mtk libor dko will follow it yourself 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.249
 profile change 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.669
 Here we choose to copy 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.749
 see that change is really 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.529
 caught 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.499
 similarly coalition and thou 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.639
 prosthetic canopy clipboard pictures 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.469
 on this principle, you can build a defense 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.859
 his e-books, of course with him 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.859
 and made Ajax 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.609
 very easy to catch 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.909
 clipboard changes 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.909
 and then using the bogota component 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.269
 just means clipboard 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.249
 using the same component too 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.249
 in the morning cube 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.449
 check it is very simple 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.239
 let's take 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.780
 again multistage in 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.780
 our field 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.979
 and try to do something skopje 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.749
 secreted 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.430
 click copy 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.159
 on Wednesday 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.059
 you look out the window just like that 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:42.270
 unavailable 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.150
 copying on the buttons we will put 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.349
 not available 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.259
 the same will happen when 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.830
 copying clipboard images in volume 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.080
 the number when you press the print screen
