00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.030
 Come on now, the clinic's smiling. 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.919
 will develop with Africans 65 man reaching meters 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.160
 of lenght 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.900
 and then begin to have a development of your rings 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.190
 pregnant you do not know to see - we will find the feminine part and the part 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.340
 then we have or several and we also have the production of the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.340
 male gametes fertilize two eggs 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.949
 leading the origin so now not much error full of cuts 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.750
 As it is, it does not get too heavy and ends up being eliminated. 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.310
 so although the government is eliminating these pregnancy rings it 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.360
 still alive in the intensive 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.000
 prey to the claw of the intestinal wall continues to its process of reproduction 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.609
 I remembered then that if they see in him it is to have a factory 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.330
 he has the feminine part 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.569
 masculine 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.030
 in each panel so the large production of new 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.710
 this illness I just described is who this is but we have the old saying 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.920
 opted for man's gut 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 but a more serious illness brought on by wages 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.420
 that's how it ends 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.380
 corzine 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.719
 is a disease in which man plays the role of the playground 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.140
 the man is the host 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.170
 intermediary 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.890
 How can it happen? 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.700
 'when the increase of the interior 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.670
 which one are you lucky 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 so now we are going to have the development of the larva 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.130
 in the musculature of man or in the nervous system of man 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.860
 leading to a sercosis neuroscience 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.820
 ex-patients that he may have 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.540
 nothing much 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.390
 strong headache may present headache 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.910
 and he may have moments may have epilepsy pictures and may have a death 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:52.799
 sudden 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.460
 depending on where you are 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.979
 of the target larva depending on the location ducci se cico 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.860
 how does the ministry the eggs contaminated food paulo through the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.720
 which we call the whole season 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.109
 the pregnancy rings end 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.909
 and it is that exploding and we have there hatching of the eggs in the very destiny of the 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:15.500
 men 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.620
 and with this we will see the evolution of the larva 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.769
 on the musculature 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.419
 such as the nervous system 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:27.689
 another disease is also important is a shame but in the shifts and known 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.909
 also like the renamo gun 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.120
 here in brazil this disease has arrived 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.969
 through two single screen causers to American 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.089
 and a nod to the borrowers and the ren then we'll talk a little bit about 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.249
 the cycle of these animals 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:48.069
 then we have cyclone cater Americans cause environmental the yellowish to 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.399
 order 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.399
 we have there communicate properly children 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.450
 the image and the patient becomes infected 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.460
 peirone letter 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.329
 and occurs in the tissue 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.789
 begins to occur its position 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.809
 then eliminated through these 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.209
 this new one remains 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.370
 in the environment meeting the ideal conditions it ends 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.599
 passing through a process of 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.619
 so we're going to have to get into the egg 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:21.429
 the evolution of the larvae then these larvae now undergo the first change 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.590
 first change of room with the trainee then 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.540
 a larva 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.269
 rabi de tories 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.590
 then we'll have to paula I can 48 hours the second change 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.590
 who miss larva known as filarioses 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.700
 later seven days after the formation of the purpose 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.150
 We'll have the queue and the unhappy Haitian I tried. 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.449
 kan this cycle of larva revolution happens on Saturday 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:51.189
 the fear 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.909
 is this revolution guaranteed now 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.909
 or wage penetration which can be a penetration 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:00.499
 civil or active 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.869
 penetration 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:02.680
 civil 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.659
 it is also a matter of course. 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.860
 passive penetration with food 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.809
 through the mouth 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.749
 what we call periods 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.320
 in man despite active penetration 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.159
 through tel duch is the goalkeeper 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.159
 think is the main form of transmission of the disease 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:25.680
 children who have vested interests are contaminated with 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.050
 ten cases end up acquiring the disease 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.409
 and we'll have a frame d I'll go are not from the government and inside it then 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.870
 follows the evolution 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.360
 as input 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.610
 of the worm 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.550
 in matters 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.099
 What are we going to try? 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.360
 this value falls into the bloodstream 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.400
 the blood supply to the power supply and to the lungs 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.629
 Where are you going to suffer? 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.770
 3rd 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.180
 to change 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.100
 bush 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.960
 moniz it now 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.139
 move to another ascent through the bronchioles 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.460
 pass to the digestive tract passing through the trachea 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.610
 and now I'm going to stop or I'm another goal 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.639
 this is a good one for the customers had sentenced the fourth change 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.730
 if any penetrated my mouth 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.730
 it goes straight to the stomach she will undergo the third change 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.979
 and to the fourth change everything intestine 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.610
 I also thought it is now 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.699
 we are going to have the development of the adult worm 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.930
 to the posterior replacement 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.229
 then these adult worms 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.509
 a cup begins to produce their eggs that are 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:39.290
 feces 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.969
 he shares interpreted 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.319
 the main symptom of the disease and plans to place in the region 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.879
 is iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency anemia 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.150
 Remembering that 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.380
 we also have the patient with some digestive complications 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.530
 also 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.470
 depending on how much veneer we will find your gut 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.360
 now you see that you give yourself a little more the other is less risk 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.960
 but I fell days and 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.800
 the water elephantiasis that is such an important disease 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.529
 the travel intent 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:17.469
 remembering that the transmission the causative agent of prophecy are the points 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:20.270
 main small cities 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.240
 ariel I await you and for our next meeting with the air 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.810
 biology even more than that
