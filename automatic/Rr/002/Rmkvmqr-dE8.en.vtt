am dgod processor i think that should be
a<00:00:30.869> DX<00:00:31.830> 600<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.850> running<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.210> 500

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
701 or 700 series so let's take a quick

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
701 or 700 series so let's take a quick
look<00:00:53.520> around<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.000> system<00:00:54.210> itself<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
look around the system itself we have a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.049 
look around the system itself we have a
Kensington<00:00:56.280> Keeler<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.910> pretty

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
Kensington Keeler which is pretty

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
Kensington Keeler which is pretty
important<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.750> these<00:00:57.899> days<00:00:58.170> after<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.649> lost

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
important in these days after we lost

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.830 
important in these days after we lost
our<00:00:59.480> gigabyte<00:01:00.710> we<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> psu<00:01:02.340> connector<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
our gigabyte we have a psu connector the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.179 
our gigabyte we have a psu connector the
jacks<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.500> microphone<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.159> your

jacks for your microphone in your

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.730 
jacks for your microphone in your
headset<00:01:05.729> pretty<00:01:06.540> much<00:01:06.720> nothing<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> front

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
headset pretty much nothing on the front

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.550 
headset pretty much nothing on the front
except<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.549> these<00:01:08.729> status<00:01:09.150> LEDs<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
except of these status LEDs we have a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
except of these status LEDs we have a
fine<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.070> card<00:01:11.369> reader<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.479> USB<00:01:12.869> 2.0<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
fine one card reader to USB 2.0 and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
fine one card reader to USB 2.0 and
ethernet<00:01:14.280> connector<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> vga<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.420> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
ethernet connector on the vga are so

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
ethernet connector on the vga are so
let's<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> look<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> bottom<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
let's take a look at the bottom of the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.770 
let's take a look at the bottom of the
system

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
system

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.899 
system
the<00:01:20.780> battery<00:01:21.140> should<00:01:21.770> be<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:21.979> fossil<00:01:22.310> battery

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
the battery should be a fossil battery

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.499 
the battery should be a fossil battery
let's<00:01:23.869> take<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.079> look<00:01:24.380> at<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.560> capacity<00:01:25.509> this

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
let's take a look at the capacity this

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.429 
let's take a look at the capacity this
is<00:01:26.840> oh<00:01:27.350> no<00:01:27.859> this<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.700> 3<00:01:28.880> cell<00:01:29.179> is<00:01:29.780> two<00:01:29.929> thousand

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
is oh no this is 3 cell is two thousand

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.160 
is oh no this is 3 cell is two thousand
eight<00:01:30.679> hundred<00:01:30.920> million<00:01:31.429> pair<00:01:31.850> but<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.869> gioi

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
eight hundred million pair but the gioi

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.029 
eight hundred million pair but the gioi
processor<00:01:33.890> doesn't<00:01:34.310> need<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.429> lot<00:01:34.609> of<00:01:34.670> power<00:01:35.030> so

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
processor doesn't need a lot of power so

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.800 
processor doesn't need a lot of power so
the<00:01:37.039> system<00:01:37.369> should<00:01:37.520> be<00:01:37.579> good<00:01:37.850> for<00:01:38.119> at<00:01:38.659> least

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
the system should be good for at least

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.719 
the system should be good for at least
some<00:01:39.049> five<00:01:39.319> hours<00:01:42.130> manufacturing<00:01:43.130> quality<00:01:43.310> in

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
some five hours manufacturing quality in

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.639 
some five hours manufacturing quality in
general<00:01:44.149> I<00:01:44.240> mean<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.509> is<00:01:44.569> an<00:01:44.810> 8.9<00:01:45.319> inch

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
general I mean this is an 8.9 inch

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.059 
general I mean this is an 8.9 inch
system<00:01:46.640> which<00:01:47.149> isn't<00:01:47.959> even<00:01:48.109> using<00:01:48.380> all<00:01:48.859> the

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
system which isn't even using all the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.589 
system which isn't even using all the
space<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.579> chancel<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.969> keyboard<00:01:50.359> of<00:01:50.420> the

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
space and chancel the keyboard of the

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.830 
space and chancel the keyboard of the
system<00:01:50.929> itself<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.450> kind<00:01:53.719> of

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
system itself so this is the kind of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.229 
system itself so this is the kind of
same<00:01:54.110> feedback<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.340> got<00:01:55.610> from<00:01:55.819> my<00:01:55.909> first

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
same feedback that I got from my first

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.559 
same feedback that I got from my first
epc<00:01:56.750> generation<00:01:57.729> pretty<00:01:58.729> small<00:01:59.060> Trek<00:01:59.390> but

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
epc generation pretty small Trek but

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.740 
epc generation pretty small Trek but
also<00:01:59.869> reminds<00:02:00.590> me<00:02:00.739> of<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.270> which<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.390> what<00:02:02.659> as

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
also reminds me of this which is what as

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.359 
also reminds me of this which is what as
good<00:02:02.929> as<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:03.469> have<00:02:03.560> single<00:02:03.950> mouse<00:02:04.129> bile

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
good as you have single mouse bile

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.729 
good as you have single mouse bile
separated<00:02:04.939> mouse<00:02:05.090> buttons<00:02:05.539> yeah<00:02:06.349> quite<00:02:06.649> an

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
separated mouse buttons yeah quite an

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.009 
separated mouse buttons yeah quite an
interesting<00:02:07.069> system<00:02:07.539> something<00:02:08.539> completely

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
interesting system something completely

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.419 
interesting system something completely
new<00:02:09.079> because<00:02:09.530> we<00:02:09.679> haven't<00:02:09.979> seen<00:02:10.129> this<00:02:10.280> you
