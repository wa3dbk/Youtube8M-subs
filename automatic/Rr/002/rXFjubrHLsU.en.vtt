00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
is a long gradual Bend going down the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.100 
is a long gradual Bend going down the
entire<00:00:36.830> ski<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.490> the<00:00:38.420> reason<00:00:38.720> it<00:00:38.810> works<00:00:38.990> so

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
entire ski and the reason it works so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.440 
entire ski and the reason it works so
well<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:40.370> more<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:40.910> get<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.180> on<00:00:41.270> edge

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
well is that the more you get it on edge

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.990 
well is that the more you get it on edge
the<00:00:42.110> more<00:00:42.140> edge<00:00:42.500> you<00:00:42.650> have<00:00:42.800> on<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.010> snow<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:43.880> it

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
the more edge you have on the snow so it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.640 
the more edge you have on the snow so it
gives<00:00:44.180> you<00:00:44.270> a<00:00:44.300> tremendous<00:00:44.480> edge<00:00:44.960> grip<00:00:45.230> and

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
gives you a tremendous edge grip and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.770 
gives you a tremendous edge grip and
then<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.040> rocker<00:00:46.700> design<00:00:46.970> just<00:00:47.450> makes<00:00:47.660> it

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
then the rocker design just makes it

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.960 
then the rocker design just makes it
very<00:00:48.079> very<00:00:48.470> maneuverable<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:49.280> soft<00:00:49.520> snow<00:00:49.700> so

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
very very maneuverable in soft snow so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.460

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
is really really good for going up hill

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.050 
is really really good for going up hill
and<00:01:38.170> by<00:01:38.619> adding<00:01:38.830> that<00:01:39.130> tip<00:01:39.340> rocker<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:39.880> it's

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
and by adding that tip rocker to it it's

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.399 
and by adding that tip rocker to it it's
going<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.270> be<00:01:40.330> more<00:01:40.479> maneuverable<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.170> soft

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
going to be more maneuverable in soft

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.899 
going to be more maneuverable in soft
snow<00:01:41.649> also

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
snow also

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.840 
snow also
so<00:01:43.450> all<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.780> skids<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.170> have<00:01:44.350> tip<00:01:44.619> rocker
