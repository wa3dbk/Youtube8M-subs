half by eleven has a certain patterns

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.529

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.909 
patterns so a lot of them have both of
them<00:05:24.330> have<00:05:24.539> some<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.020> same<00:05:25.050> patterns<00:05:25.560> but

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
them have some of the same patterns but

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.129 
them have some of the same patterns but
there's<00:05:26.370> different<00:05:26.880> ones<00:05:26.969> in<00:05:27.240> each<00:05:27.419> of<00:05:27.630> the

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
there's different ones in each of the

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.959 
there's different ones in each of the
kits<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.860> I'll<00:05:29.159> coordinate<00:05:29.729> with<00:05:29.880> the

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
kits to that I'll coordinate with the

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.209 
kits to that I'll coordinate with the
line<00:05:30.120> so<00:05:30.449> for<00:05:30.840> example<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.590> mini<00:05:31.770> album<00:05:32.069> one

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
line so for example the mini album one

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.519 
line so for example the mini album one
has<00:05:32.490> new<00:05:32.880> patterns<00:05:33.419> that<00:05:33.659> you're<00:05:34.229> not<00:05:34.380> going

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
has new patterns that you're not going

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.290 
has new patterns that you're not going
to<00:05:34.590> see<00:05:34.740> in<00:05:35.039> this<00:05:35.190> printable<00:05:35.759> line<00:05:35.940> so<00:05:36.150> that's

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
to see in this printable line so that's

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.969 
to see in this printable line so that's
kind<00:05:36.539> of<00:05:36.569> cool<00:05:36.690> too<00:05:36.870> but<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:37.680> eight<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:37.949> a

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
kind of cool too but the eight and a

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.620 
kind of cool too but the eight and a
half<00:05:38.009> by<00:05:38.099> eleven<00:05:38.550> size<00:05:38.699> is<00:05:39.060> perfect<00:05:39.270> for

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
half by eleven size is perfect for

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.909 
half by eleven size is perfect for
bigger<00:05:39.779> projects<00:05:40.259> like<00:05:40.349> this<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.710> one

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
bigger projects like this this one

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.920 
bigger projects like this this one
measures<00:05:41.279> I<00:05:41.610> think<00:05:41.849> um<00:05:42.440> eight<00:05:43.440> by<00:05:44.029> seven<00:05:45.029> eight

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
measures I think um eight by seven eight

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.480 
measures I think um eight by seven eight
by<00:05:46.110> six<00:05:46.349> and<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.500> half<00:05:46.560> something<00:05:46.919> like<00:05:47.039> that<00:05:47.310> so

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
by six and a half something like that so

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.279 
by six and a half something like that so
it's<00:05:47.610> a<00:05:47.639> good<00:05:47.759> size<00:05:47.969> and<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:48.990> you<00:05:49.080> can<00:05:49.199> make

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
it's a good size and so you can make

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.740 
it's a good size and so you can make
bigger<00:05:49.889> books<00:05:50.219> or<00:05:50.550> journals<00:05:50.580> or<00:05:51.120> mini<00:05:51.330> albums

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
bigger books or journals or mini albums

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.140 
bigger books or journals or mini albums
or<00:05:51.990> whatever<00:05:52.229> you<00:05:52.319> like<00:05:52.469> so<00:05:53.159> there<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.729> is<00:05:53.819> you
