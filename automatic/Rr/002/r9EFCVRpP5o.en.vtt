from the route we call your hair it's
gonna<00:04:14.400> be<00:04:14.580> two<00:04:14.880> tone<00:04:15.410> so<00:04:16.410> I'll<00:04:16.709> deal<00:04:16.950> with<00:04:16.979> it

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
gonna be two tone so I'll deal with it

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.580 
gonna be two tone so I'll deal with it
but<00:04:17.940> when<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.090> find<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.600> solution<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.229> know<00:04:19.289> their

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
but when I find a solution I know their

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.259 
but when I find a solution I know their
color<00:04:19.830> stick<00:04:20.220> things<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:21.090> we

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
color stick things and we

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.520 
color stick things and we
evers<00:04:21.539> I<00:04:22.759> I<00:04:23.759> guess<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.840> might<00:04:25.020> as<00:04:25.080> well<00:04:25.319> just

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
evers I I guess I might as well just

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.339 
evers I I guess I might as well just
leave<00:04:26.009> it<00:04:26.190> as<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:27.090> mean<00:04:27.360> because<00:04:27.720> I'm<00:04:27.870> not

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
leave it as it is I mean because I'm not

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.540 
leave it as it is I mean because I'm not
willing<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.220> find<00:04:29.909> an<00:04:30.449> alternative<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.520> I

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
willing to find an alternative so I

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.020 
willing to find an alternative so I
might<00:04:32.819> as<00:04:32.879> well<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:37.430> kind<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.610> show<00:04:38.849> the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
might as well just a kind of show the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.170 
might as well just a kind of show the
world<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.539> I'm<00:04:39.780> not<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.440> color<00:04:41.180> although

naturally<00:04:44.550> which<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.789> often<00:04:45.289> but<00:04:46.289> when<00:04:46.740> they
