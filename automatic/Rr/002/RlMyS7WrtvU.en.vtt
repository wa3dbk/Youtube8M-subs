 [Music] 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.680
 without so many means I remember the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.540
 first times that we came from the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.570
 band santiago del estero taking the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.110
 train the North Star and every time 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.570
 that we came to Buenos Aires of course 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.520
 of little availability of money this 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.040
 mothers were busy doing the 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.520
 Milanese sandwiches have the food 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.650
 to get to Buenos Aires and get to 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.200
 retirement and meet with the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.830
 monstrosity that is good airs for 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:49.500
 for someone who comes from the interior 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:52.740
 a totally different landscape and people 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 very hurried thing that we are not 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.430
 accustomed us clear and good 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.610
 all of this, he was afraid, he was afraid 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.910
 this but good I think the perseverance 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.130
 this 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.600
 and believe in yourself 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.540
 was consolidating this story of 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.670
 family from the set of 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.010
 carabajal and this a bit the experience 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.400
 that already had Augustine and Carlos who already 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.470
 They lived in Buenos Aires but good 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.440
 principles were hard and that's how it went 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.830
 building this story and each one 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.120
 making one's own story 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:40.080
 is finding the family finding 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.080
 the friends 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.370
 and giving a fundamental value to 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:51.290
 efforts of parents 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:56.630

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.020
 within his great difficulty he had 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.780
 to keep the family this we never 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.690

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.690

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.280

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.410

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.910
 conditions to dedicate to soccer 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.050
