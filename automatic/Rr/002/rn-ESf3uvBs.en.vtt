in<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.509> tutorial<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.230> will<00:00:07.890> show<00:00:08.130> how<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
in this tutorial I will show how to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.770 
in this tutorial I will show how to
export<00:00:09.480> models<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.500> rhino<00:00:10.980> into<00:00:11.730> SI<00:00:12.059> for

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
export models from rhino into SI for

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.740 
export models from rhino into SI for
using<00:00:13.170> these<00:00:13.349> models<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.429> simulation<00:00:15.210> within

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
using these models for simulation within

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.500 
using these models for simulation within
the<00:00:16.139> sorry<00:00:16.410> further<00:00:16.949> there<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.520> some<00:00:17.820> stuff

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the sorry further there is some stuff

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.630 
the sorry further there is some stuff
you<00:00:18.539> should<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.109> aware<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.439> regarding<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
you should be aware of regarding the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.540 
you should be aware of regarding the
geometry<00:00:21.210> layers<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.550> export-import

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
geometry layers and the export-import

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.019 
geometry layers and the export-import
that<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> will<00:00:24.269> explain<00:00:24.859> first<00:00:25.859> try<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> avoid

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that I will explain first try to avoid

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.169 
that I will explain first try to avoid
form<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.380> based<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.099> splines<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
form that is based on splines and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.459 
form that is based on splines and
circles<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:32.189> give<00:00:32.489> very<00:00:33.090> mist<00:00:33.480> form

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
circles this can give very mist form

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.670 
circles this can give very mist form
like<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.450> they<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.870> lot<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> faces

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
like this they have a lot of faces

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.510 
like this they have a lot of faces
instead<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.840> try<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.680> more<00:00:40.980> simple

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
instead of try to have more simple

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.590 
instead of try to have more simple
shapes<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.590> cylinder<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.969> even<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.180> simple

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
shapes like cylinder or even more simple

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
shapes like cylinder or even more simple
a<00:00:45.719> box<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> round

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
a box or if you want to have a round

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.150 
a box or if you want to have a round
building<00:00:48.559> use<00:00:49.940> extruded<00:00:50.940> polygons<00:00:51.449> instead

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
building use extruded polygons instead

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.770 
building use extruded polygons instead
second<00:00:53.160> try<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> work<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.570> layers

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
second try to work with the layers

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.959 
second try to work with the layers
that's<00:00:55.350> always<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> good<00:00:56.100> idea<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.730> have

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that's always a good idea so you have

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.540 
that's always a good idea so you have
the<00:00:57.120> option<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.660> turn<00:00:58.350> on/off<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.039> different

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the option of turn on/off the different

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.060 
the option of turn on/off the different
objects<00:01:00.090> even<00:01:00.690> though<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
objects even though that with this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.660 
objects even though that with this
method<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.910> rhino<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.010> society<00:01:05.010> doesn't

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
method from rhino to society doesn't

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
method from rhino to society doesn't
support<00:01:06.240> exporting<00:01:07.140> layers<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
support exporting layers then it's a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
support exporting layers then it's a
good<00:01:08.340> idea<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.729> work<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.540> layers<00:01:09.750> within<00:01:10.200> rhino

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
good idea to work in layers within rhino

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.250 
good idea to work in layers within rhino
and<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.520> gives<00:01:11.700> also<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> possibility<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and this gives also the possibility of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.490 
and this gives also the possibility of
exporting<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.549> different<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.659> separate

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
exporting it in different and separate

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.520 
exporting it in different and separate
files<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.430> different<00:01:17.790> objects<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.960> basic

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
files the different objects so as basic

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.600 
files the different objects so as basic
you<00:01:19.950> should<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.970> ground<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:22.020> layer

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
you should have the ground in one layer

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
you should have the ground in one layer
trees<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.000> another<00:01:24.689> layer<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.500> example<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
trees in another layer for example and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.090 
trees in another layer for example and
the<00:01:27.000> context<00:01:27.659> because<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.650> will<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the context because that will have a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.600 
the context because that will have a
shading<00:01:29.820> effect<00:01:30.210> inside<00:01:30.930> /<00:01:31.350> sorry<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
shading effect inside / sorry for the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.270 
shading effect inside / sorry for the
simulations<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.439> should<00:01:34.680> also<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:35.130> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
simulations so they should also be in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.240 
simulations so they should also be in
separate<00:01:35.640> layer<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.140> case<00:01:37.409> where<00:01:38.220> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
separate layer and in this case where I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.179 
separate layer and in this case where I
is<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> base<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> building<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.799> also<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
is a base for the building that's also a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.069 
is a base for the building that's also a
good<00:01:41.340> idea<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.970> placed<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.720> separate

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
good idea to have placed in a separate

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.260 
good idea to have placed in a separate
but<00:01:43.470> layer<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.520> turned<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.000> off

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but layer so it can be turned on and off

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.649 
but layer so it can be turned on and off
and<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:46.079> course<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.649> form<00:01:46.979> concepts<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.970> its

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and of course the form concepts in its

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.530 
and of course the form concepts in its
own<00:01:48.930> layer<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.729> important<00:01:51.360> if

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
own layer and this is very important if

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020 
own layer and this is very important if
you<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> model<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.399> energy

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you want to use the model for energy

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.649 
you want to use the model for energy
analysis<00:01:54.869> trav<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.950> separate<00:01:56.640> file<00:01:57.299> as

analysis trav it in a separate file as

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.800 
analysis trav it in a separate file as
mentioned<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> good<00:01:59.700> idea<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.240> export

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
mentioned it is a good idea to export

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740 
mentioned it is a good idea to export
the<00:02:01.200> different<00:02:01.649> object<00:02:02.369> types<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.939> different

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the different object types in different

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.620 
the different object types in different
files<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.409> least<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.460> should<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.299> group

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
files at least you should have it group

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.650 
files at least you should have it group
with<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.439> context<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:09.149> buildings

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
with the context like the buildings

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
imported layers and they put everything

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.520 
imported layers and they put everything
in<00:04:43.440> layer<00:04:44.370> 0<00:04:44.640> when<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.600> use<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.900> set<00:04:46.290> fire

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
in layer 0 when I use the set fire

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.000 
in layer 0 when I use the set fire
unfortunately<00:04:47.490> if<00:04:47.730> I<00:04:48.210> had<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.540> use<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.840> DVD<00:04:49.530> it

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
unfortunately if I had to use the DVD it

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.580 
unfortunately if I had to use the DVD it
will<00:04:50.250> have<00:04:50.490> imported<00:04:51.390> in<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.990> layers<00:04:52.260> that

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
will have imported in the layers that

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.340 
will have imported in the layers that
have<00:04:52.800> been<00:04:53.130> used<00:04:53.370> inside<00:04:54.030> Rhino<00:04:54.660> but<00:04:55.230> they

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
have been used inside Rhino but they

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.710 
have been used inside Rhino but they
will<00:04:55.470> mesh<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.070> geometry<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.360> will<00:04:57.510> not

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
will mesh the geometry and it will not

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.740 
will mesh the geometry and it will not
be<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.530> nice<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.070> look<00:04:59.220> at<00:04:59.370> so<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.540> want

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
be that nice to look at so if you want

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.230 
be that nice to look at so if you want
to<00:05:00.810> have<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.530> option<00:05:01.920> of<00:05:02.070> turning<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.790> trees

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
to have the option of turning the trees

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.530 
to have the option of turning the trees
of<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:04.110> need<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.560> export<00:05:05.130> these<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:06.060> a

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
of you need to export these in a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.050 
of you need to export these in a
separate<00:05:06.990> file<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.800> when<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:08.520> have<00:05:08.550> imported

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
separate file and when you have imported

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.140 
separate file and when you have imported
you<00:05:09.630> press<00:05:10.050> finish<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:11.010> then<00:05:11.730> they<00:05:11.850> will<00:05:11.970> come

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
you press finish and then they will come

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.210 
you press finish and then they will come
to<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:12.420> warning<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.650> warning<00:05:14.010> means

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
to this warning and this warning means

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.480 
to this warning and this warning means
that<00:05:14.520> inside<00:05:15.420> this<00:05:15.600> mass<00:05:15.930> there<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:16.500> only<00:05:16.710> miss

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
that inside this mass there is only miss

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.940 
that inside this mass there is only miss
geometry<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.300> that<00:05:18.810> means<00:05:19.140> that<00:05:19.380> it's<00:05:19.710> not

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
geometry and that means that it's not

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.120 
geometry and that means that it's not
solid<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.820> closed<00:05:21.630> geometry<00:05:22.290> but<00:05:22.890> that's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
solid and closed geometry but that's

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.980 
solid and closed geometry but that's
okay<00:05:23.460> because<00:05:23.670> we<00:05:24.300> are<00:05:24.360> not<00:05:24.480> going<00:05:24.660> to<00:05:24.840> use

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
okay because we are not going to use

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.350 
okay because we are not going to use
this<00:05:25.170> model<00:05:25.410> for<00:05:25.770> anything<00:05:26.280> else<00:05:26.640> than<00:05:26.910> just

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
this model for anything else than just

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.680 
this model for anything else than just
like<00:05:27.750> shading<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.790> context<00:05:29.790> but<00:05:30.390> if<00:05:30.510> we

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
like shading and context but if we

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.140 
like shading and context but if we
should<00:05:30.900> use<00:05:31.380> a<00:05:31.410> model<00:05:31.890> for<00:05:32.160> energy<00:05:32.940> simulation

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
should use a model for energy simulation

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.570 
should use a model for energy simulation
then<00:05:33.930> we<00:05:34.110> should<00:05:34.290> be<00:05:34.320> aware<00:05:34.560> of<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:35.010> warning

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
then we should be aware of this warning

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.540 
then we should be aware of this warning
but<00:05:36.270> in<00:05:36.360> this<00:05:36.480> case<00:05:36.690> that's<00:05:37.260> okay<00:05:37.590> back<00:05:38.400> in

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
but in this case that's okay back in

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.000 
but in this case that's okay back in
Rhino<00:05:38.760> if<00:05:39.060> we<00:05:39.630> then<00:05:39.810> have<00:05:40.050> created<00:05:40.680> some

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
Rhino if we then have created some

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.520 
Rhino if we then have created some
different<00:05:41.490> phone<00:05:42.030> concepts<00:05:42.660> that<00:05:42.990> we<00:05:43.200> want<00:05:43.410> to

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
different phone concepts that we want to

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.700 
different phone concepts that we want to
test<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:44.460> analyzed<00:05:44.940> within<00:05:45.420> Massari<00:05:46.260> we

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
test and analyzed within Massari we

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.280 
test and analyzed within Massari we
could<00:05:47.040> export<00:05:47.520> them<00:05:47.760> as<00:05:47.940> well<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.720> a<00:05:48.900> separate

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
could export them as well in a separate

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.250 
could export them as well in a separate
file<00:05:49.560> in<00:05:49.800> this<00:05:50.100> case<00:05:50.180> where<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.330> design<00:05:51.780> it

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
file in this case where the design it

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.820 
file in this case where the design it
looks<00:05:52.530> like<00:05:52.830> this<00:05:53.430> with<00:05:53.850> some<00:05:54.120> kind<00:05:54.300> of<00:05:54.390> base

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
looks like this with some kind of base

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.420 
looks like this with some kind of base
then<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:56.100> part<00:05:56.760> should<00:05:57.150> be<00:05:57.230> exported<00:05:58.230> as<00:05:58.320> a

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
then this part should be exported as a

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.700 
then this part should be exported as a
separate<00:05:59.430> file<00:05:59.790> so<00:06:00.540> first<00:06:00.780> I<00:06:00.930> will<00:06:01.110> save<00:06:01.500> the

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
separate file so first I will save the

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.250 
separate file so first I will save the
base<00:06:01.980> the<00:06:02.790> reason<00:06:03.180> why<00:06:03.360> I'm<00:06:03.420> suggesting<00:06:04.080> to

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
base the reason why I'm suggesting to

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.620 
base the reason why I'm suggesting to
save<00:06:04.500> this<00:06:04.680> as<00:06:04.890> separate<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:05.580> is<00:06:05.850> that<00:06:06.210> this<00:06:06.480> is

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
save this as separate I is that this is

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.530 
save this as separate I is that this is
a<00:06:06.660> part<00:06:07.020> of<00:06:07.170> the<00:06:07.350> design<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.950> maybe<00:06:08.520> this<00:06:09.180> base

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
a part of the design and maybe this base

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.020 
a part of the design and maybe this base
had<00:06:09.900> another<00:06:10.260> design<00:06:10.680> so<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.460> would<00:06:11.820> be

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
had another design so it would be

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.020 
had another design so it would be
necessary<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.690> export<00:06:13.170> it<00:06:13.430> individually<00:06:14.430> so<00:06:15.000> I

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
necessary to export it individually so I

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.180
