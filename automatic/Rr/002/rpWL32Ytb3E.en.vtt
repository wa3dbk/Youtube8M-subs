just gonna begin to cut it up into the
small<00:00:59.160> little<00:00:59.309> pieces<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.090> basically<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
small little pieces I basically want to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
small little pieces I basically want to
