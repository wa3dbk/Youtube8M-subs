00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello and welcome back to our 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.089
 special screws not everyone 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.069
 buy bicycles in shops 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.349
 specialized for it today I'm going to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.410
 show you first how you get 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.030
 the bicycle in its original packaging the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.320
 box has finally reached us and there is no 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.320
 nothing better than running open 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.849
 the carton is open now we can 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.529
 Carefully remove the bicycle when 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.180
 we took the bicycle out of the box 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.849
 the next thing is to remove the plastic 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.890
 protective in the care when using pliers 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.699
 side cut to open the flanges and 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.320
 Do not damage any cables and so that the 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.879
 Saddle do not get lost or go from here 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.879
 there to mount it directly 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.070
 to mount the front wheel what 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.780
 next thing we should do is remove the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.780
 secure the front brake 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.979
 the bicycle is new but the pedals 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.320
 I already had them that's why I'm going to use them here 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.060
 the most important thing regarding the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.430
 pedals is that there is a thread to the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.990
 right and to the left the pedal that 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.550
 placed on the right side is marked 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.490
 with a small one and the left one with 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.570
 one l before screwing the pedals 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.950
 you should grease the threads a little 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.929
 or you can tighten them with a wrench 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.780
 mouth of the 15th or from inside with the key 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.580
 allen corresponding just press 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.120
 the pedals by hand is not necessary 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.370
 that you will know too much 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.710
 it is already looking like a bicycle but 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.930
 still missing the handlebar 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.159
 for this we must extract the screws 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.159
 of the power cap 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.740
 then we can enter the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:13.330
 handlebar stem in the power and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:15.310
 screw back the moment lid 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.940
 just leave the screw a little 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:25.060
 loose then we will tighten it with a 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:27.820
 torque key before tightening the handlebar 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.650
 we must center it most of the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.360
 handlebars here have a measure for 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.910
 that we can find the center without 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.800
 problems 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.780
 the next aspect where you have 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.490
 what to notice is that the distance from the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.950
 power cap up and towards 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.960
 down is the same lest for a 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.110
 side is completely stuck and by 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.880
 another there is a huge space besides 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.730
 that the handlebar is centered is also 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.620
 decisive its degree of inclination to 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 you must place them behind the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.840
 bicycle and check if you notice 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.000
 comfortable or you have to move it a bit towards 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.980
 forward or backward 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.480
 once we have tightened the handlebar 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.610
 slightly 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.970
 we can fix it completely using a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.400
 torque key on carbon handlebars 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.520
 it is important above all to apply them the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.450
 correct torque otherwise 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.360
 we can damage it 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.730
 to avoid it the best thing is to use a key 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.010
 pair 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.959
 nowadays most of the powers 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.480
 They have printed a torque indicator 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.150
 turn and when you put 6 nm it means that 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.010
 6 newtonimeters should be applied maximum is 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.569
 say that this printed indication indicates 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.150
 the maximum value that must be tightened 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.239
 a screw 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.939
 It is advisable to go squeezing until 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.939
 the right turn bar is reached 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.020
 now the handlebar is already fixed without 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.970
 But we must not forget before 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.920
 try the bicycle adjust the game of 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.020
 Bearing of the tube bearings 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.590
 address if it can not happen that the 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.569
 power is not fixed properly to the tube 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.099
 to adjust the headset what 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.940
 next thing we should do is loosen 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.060
 these two stop screws 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.010
 and then we can install the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.350
 steering game 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.139
 through the lid with the help of another 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.760
 allen key always check the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.169
 smoothness of movements with which 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.060
 elevates the bicycle in front and 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.560
 observe if the handlebar can rotate through 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.419
 yes only to the right and to the 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.370
 left below has filled the 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.050
 brake the front wheel and move it 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.270
 slightly forward and backward 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.990
 to see if the direction game has 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.060
 slack or if you do not have more slack and the 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.690
 Steering tube can still move with 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.539
 ease 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.639
 we must transpose the straight handlebar of 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.919
 again tighten the two screws with the 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.610
 hand and finally fix the ones with 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.610
 a key pair 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.970
 I just have to recommend you both if 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.810
 you have a new bike as a borrowed 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.730
 check the security elements in 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.220
 As for the handlebar we have already checked 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.430
 the screws and both wheels and we have already 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.740
 installed the front wheel i will go back 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.940
 to check the rear wheel and maybe the 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.940
 fixing the brakes 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.350
 the wheels should still inflate more this 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.000
 is something particular since it depends on 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.130
 little of the width of the covers and 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.530
 of the weight of the person when it comes to 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.870
 of a 24 wheel like this one and the 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.480
 person weighs 70 kilos enough with one 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.970
 pressure of less than two bars about 17 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.890
 approximately in the next video os 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.960
 I will teach how to correctly adjust the 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.340
 driving train and how to find the 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.340
 proper position of the saddle
