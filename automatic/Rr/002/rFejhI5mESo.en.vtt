hi<00:00:02.220> guys<00:00:02.570> what<00:00:03.570> I've<00:00:03.689> been<00:00:03.780> working<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.259> the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
hi guys what I've been working on the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.880 
hi guys what I've been working on the
past<00:00:05.430> week<00:00:05.850> or<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.180> has<00:00:06.480> been<00:00:06.649> converting<00:00:07.649> a

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
past week or two has been converting a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.230 
past week or two has been converting a
gas<00:00:08.460> engine<00:00:09.290> to<00:00:10.290> run<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:10.769> compressed<00:00:11.429> air<00:00:11.790> or

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
gas engine to run on compressed air or

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.099 
gas engine to run on compressed air or
steam<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:13.679> eventually<00:00:14.190> make<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:15.109> generator

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
steam to eventually make a generator

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.050 
steam to eventually make a generator
that<00:00:16.410> would<00:00:17.220> run<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:18.260> steam<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:20.060> heated

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
that would run on steam that is heated

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.269 
that would run on steam that is heated
by<00:00:21.090> wood<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.350> effectively<00:00:22.890> making<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
by wood so effectively making a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.050 
by wood so effectively making a
generator<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.029> runs<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.449> wood<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.760> start

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
generator that runs on wood but to start

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.450 
generator that runs on wood but to start
I<00:00:27.330> am<00:00:28.070> making<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:30.740> prototype<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> small

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I am making a a prototype with a small

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
I am making a a prototype with a small
two-stroke<00:00:33.000> engine<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.899> harvested<00:00:34.410> from

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
two-stroke engine that I harvested from

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.240 
two-stroke engine that I harvested from
a<00:00:34.649> hold<00:00:35.480> leaf<00:00:36.480> blower<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.440> sitting

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
a hold leaf blower that we have sitting

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.430 
a hold leaf blower that we have sitting
around<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.780> basically<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:41.399> I'm<00:00:41.520> doing<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
around so basically what I'm doing is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.630 
around so basically what I'm doing is
timing<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.770> air<00:00:44.840> burst<00:00:46.160> going<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.309> where<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
timing the air burst going and where the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.850 
timing the air burst going and where the
spark<00:00:47.910> plug<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.300> normally<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.020> instead

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
spark plug would normally be so instead

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.459 
spark plug would normally be so instead
of<00:00:49.980> an<00:00:50.129> explosion<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> engine<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.809> gave<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
of an explosion in the engine I gave it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.920 
of an explosion in the engine I gave it
a<00:00:52.530> large<00:00:52.739> burst<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.250> air<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:56.480> how<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.629> doing

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a large burst of air and how I'm doing

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.150 
a large burst of air and how I'm doing
this<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> air<00:01:00.840> gun<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this right now is I have a air gun and I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.330 
this right now is I have a air gun and I
wouldn't<00:01:02.570> go<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.479> blow<00:01:07.220> when<00:01:08.220> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
wouldn't go up here and blow when it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.890 
wouldn't go up here and blow when it
comes<00:01:08.610> down<00:01:09.590> low<00:01:10.590> comes<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
comes down low comes down when the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.140 
comes down low comes down when the
cylinder<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.710> top<00:01:13.950> dead<00:01:14.189> center<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
cylinder is that top dead center and it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.070 
cylinder is that top dead center and it
pushes<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> gun<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.750> when<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> cylinder

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
pushes the gun on and when the cylinder

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.190 
pushes the gun on and when the cylinder
goes<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> way<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:21.150> turns<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
goes all the way down it turns off that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.969 
goes all the way down it turns off that
shuts<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> air<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.680> really

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
shuts off the air so it's really

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
shuts off the air so it's really
mimicking<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.490> way<00:01:29.520> an<00:01:29.909> explosion<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.479> be

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
mimicking the way an explosion would be

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.450 
mimicking the way an explosion would be
in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> engine<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.829> took<00:01:35.009> me<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> couple

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
in the engine so I it took me a couple

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
in the engine so I it took me a couple
times<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.970> figure<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:37.259> size<00:01:37.560> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
times to figure out the right size for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.890 
times to figure out the right size for
this<00:01:38.040> lobe<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.360> because<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this lobe you know because you have to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.810 
this lobe you know because you have to
have<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.729> sustain<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.210> how<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
have the right sustain and how the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.550 
have the right sustain and how the
sustain<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.509> long<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> burst<00:01:46.200> would<00:01:46.409> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
sustain is how long the burst would be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.850 
sustain is how long the burst would be
and<00:01:47.329> how<00:01:48.329> hard<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> burst<00:01:49.140> needs<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.619> with

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and how hard the burst needs to be with

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.190 
and how hard the burst needs to be with
how<00:01:49.979> hardening<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> push<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.880> gun<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.740 

my<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.090> wasn't<00:01:57.090> quite<00:01:57.240> sure<00:01:57.299> where

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
my first one I wasn't quite sure where

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.340 
my first one I wasn't quite sure where
the<00:01:57.990> gun<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.469> gonna<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.950> situated<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:01.200> was

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the gun was gonna be situated so it was

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.190 
the gun was gonna be situated so it was
off<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.180> my<00:02:03.329> second<00:02:03.689> time<00:02:03.869> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
off a little bit but on my second time I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.809 
off a little bit but on my second time I
got<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.390> think<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.840> right<00:02:07.190> where<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
got it I think just about right where it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.890 
got it I think just about right where it
it<00:02:09.360> doesn't<00:02:09.660> burst<00:02:09.929> too<00:02:10.170> long<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.690> get

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it doesn't burst too long but you get

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.610 
it doesn't burst too long but you get
quite<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
quite a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.390 
quite a
power<00:02:13.920> out<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.769> get<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.099> start

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
power out of it and to get it to start

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.809 
power out of it and to get it to start
all<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:20.430> turn<00:02:20.640> it

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
all you have to do is just to turn it

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.479 
all you have to do is just to turn it
turn<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.659> over<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.080> give<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.950> first<00:02:23.129> burst

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
turn it over and give it the first burst

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.539 
turn it over and give it the first burst
of<00:02:23.700> air<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.150> then<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.049> obviously<00:02:25.950> continues

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
of air and then it obviously continues

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:55.960 
of air and then it obviously continues
to<00:02:26.700> run<00:02:26.849> from<00:02:27.209> there

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.000 

as<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.210> was<00:02:57.360> running<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.840> was<00:02:57.990> pulling<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
as that was running I was pulling the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.750 
as that was running I was pulling the
hose<00:02:59.220> back<00:02:59.610> with<00:03:00.120> my<00:03:00.270> hand<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
hose back with my hand and I have a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.520 
hose back with my hand and I have a
small<00:03:03.090> groove<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> wood<00:03:03.810> here<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.380> it

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
small groove in the wood here so it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.120 
small groove in the wood here so it
actually<00:03:04.680> pulls<00:03:05.160> up<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.910> airgun<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:07.130> it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
actually pulls up the airgun and it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.220 
actually pulls up the airgun and it
gives<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.580> little<00:03:08.700> bit<00:03:08.910> more<00:03:09.090> sustain<00:03:09.569> which

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
gives it a little bit more sustain which

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.870 
gives it a little bit more sustain which
makes<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.680> rev<00:03:10.920> faster<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:13.740> in<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.730> way

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
makes it rev faster so it's in a way

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.260 
makes it rev faster so it's in a way
almost<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:17.180> throttling<00:03:18.620> technique<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
almost like a throttling technique and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.760 
almost like a throttling technique and
it's<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.630> speeds<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.110> engine<00:03:22.530> because<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
it's it speeds up the engine because of

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.880 
it's it speeds up the engine because of
the<00:03:22.860> longer<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.670> longer<00:03:24.569> sustain<00:03:24.989> and

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.650 

harsher<00:03:28.890> air<00:03:29.160> bursts<00:03:29.670> from<00:03:30.060> lifting<00:03:30.390> up<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
harsher air bursts from lifting up the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.470 
harsher air bursts from lifting up the
air<00:03:30.810> gun<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:32.250> low<00:03:32.400> pushes<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:33.000> air<00:03:33.239> gun

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
air gun and the low pushes on air gun

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.070 
air gun and the low pushes on air gun
harder<00:03:33.930> which<00:03:34.519> gives<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.900> longer<00:03:36.900> and

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
harder which gives it a longer and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.270 
harder which gives it a longer and
harder<00:03:37.650> burst<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:40.739> all<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:40.980> have<00:03:41.250> for

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
harder burst so that's all I have for

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.460 
harder burst so that's all I have for
today<00:03:41.730> eventually<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.900> will<00:03:43.200> have<00:03:43.350> it

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
today eventually I will have it

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.910 
today eventually I will have it
connected<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.190> an<00:03:44.489> alternator<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.739> just<00:03:46.739> kind

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
connected to an alternator as just kind

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.530 
connected to an alternator as just kind
of<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.100> trial<00:03:47.370> run<00:03:47.610> I've<00:03:47.790> seen<00:03:48.000> how<00:03:48.150> much<00:03:48.269> power

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
of a trial run I've seen how much power

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.060 
of a trial run I've seen how much power
I<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.870> get<00:03:49.019> out<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.350> small<00:03:49.620> engine<00:03:49.920> like

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
I can get out of a small engine like

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.900 
I can get out of a small engine like
this<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:51.060> how<00:03:51.180> much<00:03:51.300> power<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.910> generate

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
this but how much power I can generate

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.540 
this but how much power I can generate
and<00:03:54.440> eventually<00:03:55.440> I'll<00:03:55.680> have<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.070> running<00:03:56.310> on

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
and eventually I'll have it running on

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.430 
and eventually I'll have it running on
something<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.330> would<00:03:57.450> be<00:03:57.600> alternating

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
something that would be alternating

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.759 
something that would be alternating
current<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.150> we<00:04:00.150> had<00:04:00.329> an<00:04:00.870> alternator<00:04:01.350> knitter

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
current but we had an alternator knitter

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.190 
current but we had an alternator knitter
kind<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.459> lying<00:04:02.610> around<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.299> we're<00:04:04.110> gonna

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
kind of lying around so we're gonna

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.740 
kind of lying around so we're gonna
start<00:04:04.739> with<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.519> see<00:04:06.150> what<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.299> can<00:04:06.540> do

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
start with that and see what I can do

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.290 
start with that and see what I can do
next
