whole<00:01:03.110> song<00:01:03.380> based<00:01:03.680> on<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.040> that's<00:01:04.460> my<00:01:04.640> feel

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
whole song based on that that's my feel

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.030 
whole song based on that that's my feel
but<00:01:05.269> um<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.180> first<00:01:08.420> thing<00:01:09.040> they're

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
but um so that's the first thing they're

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.830 
but um so that's the first thing they're
like<00:01:11.170> about<00:01:12.170> 88<00:01:12.680> beats<00:01:12.950> per<00:01:13.160> minute<00:01:13.460> for<00:01:13.780> go<00:01:14.780> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
like about 88 beats per minute for go to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.590 
like about 88 beats per minute for go to
a<00:01:15.020> determinate<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.160> it's<00:01:16.310> fast<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.330> don't

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
a determinate so it's fast and I don't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.060 
a determinate so it's fast and I don't
think<00:01:17.810> I'm<00:01:17.960> not<00:01:18.170> fast<00:01:18.440> i<00:01:18.680> don't<00:01:18.830> have<00:01:18.920> my

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
bedroom with you right now i think i

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.450

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
think about 80 something especially I'm

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.720 
think about 80 something especially I'm
out<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.700> practice

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.090 

that's<00:01:34.600> pretty<00:01:34.870> fast<00:01:35.170> but<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.410> can't<00:01:35.710> really

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
that's pretty fast but I can't really

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.180 
that's pretty fast but I can't really
keep<00:01:36.250> going<00:01:36.490> up<00:01:36.610> so<00:01:36.820> that's<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.720> deal<00:01:38.190> that's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
keep going up so that's the deal that's

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.160 
keep going up so that's the deal that's
the<00:01:39.310> number<00:01:39.640> one<00:01:39.760> problem<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.360> self

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.760 

and<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:46.000> because<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:47.380> other<00:01:47.500> comment

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
and just because it's one other comment

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.620 
and just because it's one other comment
about<00:01:48.070> that<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.400> because<00:01:48.670> it's<00:01:48.820> such<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.210> speed

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
about that is because it's such a speed

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.580 
about that is because it's such a speed
it's<00:01:49.840> hard<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.610> groove<00:01:52.380> sorry<00:01:53.380> that's

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590
