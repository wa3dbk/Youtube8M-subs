00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.340
 mustafa kemal atatÃ¼rk this reasoned 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.949
 exactly 90 years ago today's turkey 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.930
 and led, inter alia, the Arabic 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.359
 font and the Latin 1 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
 and for all his merits he got 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.000
 the name hard guy the father of all 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.250
 turks and now this is exactly 90 years 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.289
 is her and this so far my 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 favorite dessert is I want it for you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.520
 imagine 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.250
 for the syrup your sugar needs water 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.469
 and lemon juice or citric acid 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.219
 the whole gives her in a saucepan and 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.899
 briefly and let simmer for 15 minutes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.579
 and then just cool down 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.950
 to let 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.980
 I owe you a turkish word that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.629
 is cutler dessert table today 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 and now of course it's up to the dough 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 For that you need flour baking powder 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.689
 butter and quark or 24 hours 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.700
 hung the yogurt a link like her 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.020
 could make the write himself 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.150
 I'll take you to the infobox 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.119
 but I'm way too impatient for that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.220
 i just do that with quark and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.299
 it works just as well and in the oven 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.150
 Preheat otherwise with baking powder butter 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.560
 eggs and quark in a mixing bowl 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.770
 give and the whole with knethaken 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.350
 whisk 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 if you take yogurt then hung up 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.549
 The dough is relatively firm 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.200
 then you can do it by hand before he 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.790
 that does not do it then he becomes one 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.960
 a little softer , I always take two 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 teaspoon for that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 I always give only part of the milk 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.649
 the flour and then the rest 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.530
 because then I have a nice one 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.110
 Homogeneous dough and yes if you can 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.770
 you could do the dough with two 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.600
 teaspoons into small beads form 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.719
 and then on a baking sheet with 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.340
 give baking paper and if you of course 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.540
 The hung yoghurt then takes 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.509
 you just have to go by hand 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.910
 globule shape gets about 18 to 19 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.290
 piece out you look like me 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.500
 Here I always write to you 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.210
 so 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.560
 against each other and through there I get 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.510
 the form right him who pulls himself 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.930
 Afterwards in the oven already nice and smooth 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.520
 So do not worry and then you give that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.460
 then simply in the oven the bug then 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.600
 about 30 minutes and then you have it 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.640
 beautiful golden yellow color and the whole in 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.920
 give it a shape where you put the syrup on it 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.570
 I can put the mold into something 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.959
 so wrong with the syrup 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.209
 all part in it coming and then just 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.280
 pour over the syrup and I do 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.050
 here twice the amount 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.390
 and that's why it's so much you get 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.650
 just like I said 18 to 19 pieces from it 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.900
 and the whole thing is served cold 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.910
 So I put it in the fridge 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.010
 with pistachios or you can too 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.510
 take coconut flakes and his me 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.959
 wish you a good appetite euro 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.959
 decide
