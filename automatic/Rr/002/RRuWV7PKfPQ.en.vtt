I also want to show you how I'm holding
my<00:00:40.280> tweezers<00:00:42.220> basically<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.340> edge<00:00:43.520> of<00:00:43.820> my

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
my tweezers basically the edge of my

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.600 
my tweezers basically the edge of my
tweezer<00:00:44.360> with<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.380> very<00:00:45.620> tip<00:00:45.860> rested<00:00:46.370> on<00:00:46.490> the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
tweezer with the very tip rested on the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.060 
tweezer with the very tip rested on the
back<00:00:46.760> of<00:00:46.970> my<00:00:47.120> hand<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.650> same<00:00:48.890> with

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
back of my hand and it's the same with

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.560 
back of my hand and it's the same with
this<00:00:49.280> side<00:00:49.340> here<00:00:54.760> generally<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.880> lashes<00:00:56.360> on

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
this side here generally the lashes on

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.040 
this side here generally the lashes on
the<00:00:56.809> outer<00:00:57.080> and<00:00:57.500> inner<00:00:58.070> corners<00:00:58.850> are<00:00:59.090> slightly

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
the outer and inner corners are slightly

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.670 
the outer and inner corners are slightly
shorter<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:01.760> we'll<00:01:02.000> start<00:01:02.330> with<00:01:02.540> a<00:01:02.680> slightly

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
shorter so we'll start with a slightly

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.500 
shorter so we'll start with a slightly
shorter<00:01:03.860> extension<00:01:04.790> we're<00:01:04.970> going<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.180> go<00:01:05.449> to

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
shorter extension we're going to go to

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.219 
shorter extension we're going to go to
1/8<00:01:06.080> first<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.729> because<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:08.990> going<00:01:09.170> to

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
1/8 first and because this is going to

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.950 
1/8 first and because this is going to
be<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> partial<00:01:09.770> with<00:01:10.729> partials<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:11.780> can

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
be a partial with partials you can

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.030 
be a partial with partials you can
either<00:01:12.610> spread<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.940> 25<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.750> 40<00:01:15.080> lashes<00:01:15.259> evenly

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
either spread the 25 to 40 lashes evenly

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.820 
either spread the 25 to 40 lashes evenly
across<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.759> entire<00:01:17.119> eye<00:01:17.150> or<00:01:17.750> if<00:01:18.410> they<00:01:18.590> want

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830

more of a cat eye look you can

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:42.530 
more of a cat eye look you can
concentrate<00:01:21.440> them<00:01:21.860> on<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.190> outer<00:01:22.369> corner

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
millimeter from the lash line so that no

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:04.810 
millimeter from the lash line so that no
glue<00:01:50.490> ever<00:01:51.490> gets<00:01:51.850> into<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.330> eye
