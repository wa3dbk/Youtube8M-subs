00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
this is one of the best color ways that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.480 
this is one of the best color ways that
the<00:01:56.640> braun<00:01:56.970> series<00:01:57.330> has<00:01:57.600> ever<00:01:57.810> come<00:01:58.050> out<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
the braun series has ever come out with

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.570 
the braun series has ever come out with
the<00:01:59.490> china<00:01:59.760> is<00:01:59.940> was<00:02:00.150> probably<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.780> first<00:02:01.050> one

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
the china is was probably the first one

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.520

the<00:02:02.580> lebron<00:02:02.910> 9<00:02:03.150> series<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:04.050> probably<00:02:04.410> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the lebron 9 series is probably the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.820 
the lebron 9 series is probably the
first<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.010> china<00:02:05.490> colorway<00:02:06.200> then<00:02:07.200> came<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
first one china colorway then came the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.270
