00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.210
 we speak again 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 this moment on the screen for you 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.970
 to say that this party 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.769
 still today 23 pages very good because many think we 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:16.500
 have 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.810
 intercepted in Switzerland 2 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.300
 he has been sought for a long time by our services 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.499
 this breakdown but no store we have rather some 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.470
 they are still 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.570
 and good that we are still on the ground like the holder in the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.410
 surroundings 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.360
 I am a little 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.580
 and so he does not know we follow 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.220
 opposite 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 it's free 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.830
 other finding the next ten months once again the world 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.730
 then the suspect will come back to his vehicle we wait but ignored 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.730
 % var imagine hawks right now 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.250
 any case without papers that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.250
 the net loss amounts to $ 700 million 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 the gendarmes 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.000
 optimism 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.140
 when you cross your fingers 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.360
 concacaf among others apply for triple play offers is not my 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.110
 clean design people 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.730
 8% growth goal currently we will qualify ourselves 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.090
 for play-offs 3 teams witnesses report Thursday 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.750
 it's always insidious 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 that means we hear little more I'm optimistic 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.670
 vale 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.670
 you have to be able 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.960
 for the South Korean spokesman 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.480
 paul the octopus wwf 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.780
 for the sixth time I told my kid I'm happy with that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.749
 is doing better than new audiences 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.880
 we can no longer concordat 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.040
 the model that we made so that it was individual were looking for a 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.190
 club I immediately go to a sharp decline 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.410
 article 7 by tyrosse know kate 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.049
 the tray as m 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.249
 painfulness 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.450
 I will not feel pity 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.810
 octo technology the nautical club however the fact that all the others 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.630
 species by their refusal to call the riot squad because we do not know 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.219
 never what could be question 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.499
 the whole world 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.669
 yeah why these offers she will be surrounded 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.059
 these projects 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.209
 - the Dutch bank 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.779
 the tabbee of orange to dispatcher 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.299
 in midfield the danger my mother 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.650
 andreu he dislodged and this has become a obvious a conflict for more than 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.719
 four 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.729
 as for growth 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.799
 another highlight at the prosecutor's office 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.599
 I think that 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.509
 of course I thought about it 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.309
 convenient 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.309
 even if the club does not have anywhere 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.359
 why centuries 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.719
 j 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.979
 why this patch is intercepted 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:17.029
 a very dangerous weapon that allowed were explosives 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.619
 because if it is not acceptable 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.389
 so I fulfilled my mission 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.389
 it's a coop and migros the couple 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.579
 36 yes 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.719
 the budget the memory quiet conscience 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.310
 most magazines is able to have the greatest happiness of the 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:39.049
 world the most used meanwhile the young man is so reduced and 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.439
 perhaps more he indicated that in case of doubt contact the call 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.319
 perhaps 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.189
 because truteau stone size can no longer 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.039
 you tell me small structures 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:52.629
 your own following subsequently presented Wednesday at the prosecutor's office 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.269
 Brussels this surveillance sgs to 103 of the law however it is what is 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.379
 not in rest which is a setback to see clearly 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.540
 to hear him say to barack obama take part there he would currently be at 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.039
 the drift 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.049
 others 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.269
 while 19.8% in the previous month contributed to 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.269
 streamers reflection I let myself embark 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.259
 not true christian knight 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:26.099
 g20 leaders to act 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.099
 anyway start the year well 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.509
 but it is not 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.099
 we must do everything for you 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.960
 the issuing institute 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.050
 they were, among others, postponed to Tuesday, February 3, March and April 2014 and

 financial stability efsf the assertive personality of the automobile 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.069
 general motors and fatigue and it causes senility 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.460
 altarea 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.460
 it will validate already quite a lot 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.909
 but it is limited 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.349
 rage 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.830
 but Germany

 speaking in front of tottenham 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:08.560
 3:32 p.m. 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.560
 stay tuned on your agendas
