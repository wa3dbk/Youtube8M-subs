in this video I'm gonna quickly go over
the<00:00:02.010> top<00:00:02.310> supplementation<00:00:03.240> that<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.389> recommend

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
the top supplementation that I recommend

my hockey athletes to take now
supplementation<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.259> huge<00:00:07.589> topic<00:00:07.859> right

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
supplementation is a huge topic right

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.980 
supplementation is a huge topic right
everybody<00:00:08.670> always<00:00:08.849> wants<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.330> immediately

everybody always wants to immediately

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.020 
everybody always wants to immediately
take<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.800> supplement<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.639> ready<00:00:11.910> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
take that supplement and be ready to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.490 
take that supplement and be ready to
rock<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> ice<00:00:12.809> that's<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> improve

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
rock on the ice that's going to improve

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.140 
rock on the ice that's going to improve
their<00:00:13.679> performance<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.519> doesn't<00:00:14.940> always

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
their performance and it doesn't always

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.279 
their performance and it doesn't always
work<00:00:15.269> out<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:15.630> that

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
work out like that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.590 
work out like that
so<00:00:16.710> when<00:00:16.920> real<00:00:17.190> comes<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.730> real<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.480> ask

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so when real comes to real we got to ask

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.689 
so when real comes to real we got to ask
yourself<00:00:19.050> at<00:00:19.199> least<00:00:19.230> three<00:00:19.890> questions<00:00:20.400> when

yourself at least three questions when

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.580 
yourself at least three questions when
it<00:00:20.850> comes<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.660> choosing<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.439> new

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it comes to choosing a new

it comes to choosing a new

supplementation to add to your current

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.220 
supplementation to add to your current
regimen<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.189> number<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.430> isn't<00:00:27.119> safe<00:00:27.330> number

once<00:01:52.890> you've<00:01:53.040> hit<00:01:53.250> your<00:01:53.310> saturation<00:01:54.090> limit

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
once you've hit your saturation limit

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
once you've hit your saturation limit
that<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> benefits<00:01:55.860> are<00:01:56.009> coming<00:01:56.310> in

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that is when the benefits are coming in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.209 
that is when the benefits are coming in
anyways<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.600> you're<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.140> hit<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> saturation

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
anyways so you're gonna hit a saturation

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.060 
anyways so you're gonna hit a saturation
limit<00:01:59.520> with<00:02:00.000> monohydrate<00:02:00.719> or<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.799> something

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
limit with monohydrate or with something

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.340 
limit with monohydrate or with something
that<00:02:02.340> costs<00:02:02.700> 10<00:02:02.909> times<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.390> much<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.930> benefits

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that costs 10 times as much the benefits

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.959 
that costs 10 times as much the benefits
is<00:02:04.469> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> exact<00:02:05.159> same<00:02:05.219> coming

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
is going to be the exact same coming

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.219 
is going to be the exact same coming
from<00:02:06.119> creatine<00:02:06.600> they're<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:06.840> coming<00:02:07.140> from

we're<00:02:15.129> talking<00:02:15.250> about<00:02:15.519> here<00:02:15.849> creatine

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
we're talking about here creatine

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.119 
we're talking about here creatine
monohydrate<00:02:16.840> has<00:02:17.409> an<00:02:17.530> effect<00:02:17.829> on<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
monohydrate has an effect on the

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.369 
monohydrate has an effect on the
anaerobic<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.790> lactic<00:02:19.239> system<00:02:19.629> so<00:02:19.989> it's<00:02:20.200> gonna

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
anaerobic a lactic system so it's gonna

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.009 
anaerobic a lactic system so it's gonna
improve<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.250> lot<00:02:21.489> your<00:02:22.090> rate<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.810> power

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
improve a lot your rate of power

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.170 
improve a lot your rate of power
production<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.920> how<00:02:24.159> fast<00:02:24.519> your<00:02:24.819> body's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
production so how fast your body's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.600 
production so how fast your body's
ability<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.870> produce<00:02:26.019> power<00:02:26.409> and<00:02:26.769> produce<00:02:27.129> ATP

source for both the muscular system and
the<00:03:22.810> nervous<00:03:23.169> system<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:23.799> that's<00:03:23.949> extremely

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
the nervous system and that's extremely

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.610 
the nervous system and that's extremely
important<00:03:24.879> for<00:03:25.000> athletes<00:03:25.419> because<00:03:26.169> if<00:03:26.470> you're

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
important for athletes because if you're

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.199 
important for athletes because if you're
fueling<00:03:26.949> your<00:03:27.099> nervous<00:03:27.400> system<00:03:27.519> as<00:03:27.819> well<00:03:27.970> you

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
fueling your nervous system as well you

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.319 
fueling your nervous system as well you
can<00:03:28.359> prevent<00:03:28.599> systemic<00:03:29.169> fatigue<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.329> local

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
can prevent systemic fatigue so local

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.110 
can prevent systemic fatigue so local
fatigue<00:03:31.660> can<00:03:31.930> actually<00:03:32.500> become<00:03:33.340> half<00:03:33.879> their

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
fatigue can actually become half their

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.750 
fatigue can actually become half their
systemic<00:03:34.569> fatigue<00:03:35.169> and<00:03:35.440> what<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.069> mean<00:03:36.310> by<00:03:36.370> that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
systemic fatigue and what I mean by that

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.640 
systemic fatigue and what I mean by that
like<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.239> make<00:03:37.389> the<00:03:37.540> example<00:03:38.049> easy<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.500> you're

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
like to make the example easy if you're

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.699 
like to make the example easy if you're
doing<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:39.010> set<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.310> bicep<00:03:39.730> curls<00:03:40.120> your<00:03:40.840> systemic

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
doing a set of bicep curls your systemic

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.280 
doing a set of bicep curls your systemic
fatigue<00:03:42.250> can<00:03:42.639> actually<00:03:43.030> occur<00:03:43.419> before<00:03:43.900> your

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
fatigue can actually occur before your

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.720 
fatigue can actually occur before your
biceps<00:03:44.709> actually<00:03:45.099> fatigue<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
biceps actually fatigue and

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.909 
biceps actually fatigue and
carbohydrates<00:03:46.599> are<00:03:46.750> gonna<00:03:46.840> help<00:03:47.079> fuel<00:03:47.620> both

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
carbohydrates are gonna help fuel both

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.460 
carbohydrates are gonna help fuel both
your<00:03:48.129> nervous<00:03:48.430> system<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.970> local<00:03:49.870> muscular

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
your nervous system and local muscular

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.650 
your nervous system and local muscular
system<00:03:50.859> so<00:03:50.980> you're<00:03:51.099> gonna<00:03:51.250> help<00:03:51.459> both<00:03:51.879> in<00:03:52.150> that

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
system so you're gonna help both in that

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.390 
system so you're gonna help both in that
effect<00:03:53.019> but<00:03:53.230> carbohydrates<00:03:53.889> really<00:03:54.190> help

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
effect but carbohydrates really help

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.270 
effect but carbohydrates really help
anaerobic<00:03:55.060> glycolysis<00:03:55.359> so<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.440> is<00:03:56.739> fueling

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
anaerobic glycolysis so this is fueling

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.210 
anaerobic glycolysis so this is fueling
once<00:03:57.489> again<00:03:57.790> your<00:03:57.970> anaerobic<00:03:58.299> systems<00:03:59.220> which

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
once again your anaerobic systems which

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.800 
once again your anaerobic systems which
is<00:04:00.370> going<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.639> directly<00:04:00.970> improve<00:04:01.120> your

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
is going to directly improve your

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.830 
is going to directly improve your
performance<00:04:02.349> on<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> ice<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:04.000> third<00:04:04.299> one<00:04:04.599> is

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
performance on the ice the third one is

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.180 
performance on the ice the third one is
