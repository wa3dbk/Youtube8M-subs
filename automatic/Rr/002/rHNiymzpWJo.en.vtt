base and yeah so here i have the
courtyard<00:00:23.660> s2<00:00:24.660> green<00:00:24.960> base<00:00:25.260> plates<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.039> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
courtyard s2 green base plates and this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.300 
courtyard s2 green base plates and this
date<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.599> i<00:00:27.630> use<00:00:27.900> from<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.830> i<00:00:28.859> used<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
date here that i use from that i used a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.569 
date here that i use from that i used a
ton<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.699> bricks<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> build<00:00:31.250> there's<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
ton of bricks to build there's the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.030 
ton of bricks to build there's the
machine<00:00:32.940> gun<00:00:33.239> turrets<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.410> i<00:00:34.500> usually<00:00:34.710> have

machine gun turrets that i usually have

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.620 
machine gun turrets that i usually have
on<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.340> gunship<00:00:35.579> which<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.239> over<00:00:36.390> there<00:00:36.480> with

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
on my gunship which are over there with

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
my shuttle and tank and then I have

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.139 
my shuttle and tank and then I have
another<00:00:39.750> clone<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:42.230> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.770> courtyard

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
another clone up here in the courtyard

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.420 
another clone up here in the courtyard
have<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.539> comb<00:00:45.809> Walker's<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> speeder<00:00:46.829> bike<00:00:47.160> in

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
have to comb Walker's a speeder bike in

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.330 
have to comb Walker's a speeder bike in
this<00:00:48.059> mock<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.629> made<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.320> said<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
this mock I made it said it's a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.139 
this mock I made it said it's a
transport<00:00:51.300> truck<00:00:51.480> driven<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.199> stormtrooper

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
transport truck driven by a stormtrooper

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
transport truck driven by a stormtrooper
then<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.930> speeder<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
then here we have a speeder that the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.650 
then here we have a speeder that the
comb<00:00:56.550> commanders<00:00:57.090> use<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.890> over<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.789> used

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
comb commanders use and over here I used

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
comb commanders use and over here I used
to<00:01:00.899> clone<00:01:01.559> walkers<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> couple<00:01:02.699> extra

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to clone walkers and a couple extra

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
to clone walkers and a couple extra
pieces<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.629> build<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:04.129> then<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
pieces to build this then we have the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
pieces to build this then we have the
command<00:01:05.909> center<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.420> goes<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> gunship

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
command center that goes to the gunship

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.649 
command center that goes to the gunship
and<00:01:07.790> 2<00:01:08.900> episode<00:01:09.900> 3<00:01:10.170> clone<00:01:10.830> troopers<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> then

and 2 episode 3 clone troopers and then

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.390 
and 2 episode 3 clone troopers and then
here<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.490> made<00:01:14.939> these<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.479> yesterday<00:01:16.400> they're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
here and made these as yesterday they're

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.539 
here and made these as yesterday they're
paratrooper<00:01:18.240> clones<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.860> paratroopers

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
paratrooper clones of the paratroopers

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
paratrooper clones of the paratroopers
of<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:20.909> Legion<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.509> 217th<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.650> haven't

of my Legion the 217th so on I haven't
decided<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.340> color<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.090> paint

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
decided what color I'm going to paint

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.190 
decided what color I'm going to paint
all<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:30.840> clones<00:01:31.170> yet<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.630> can<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> guys<00:01:33.900> leave

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
all my clones yet but can you guys leave

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
all my clones yet but can you guys leave
some<00:01:34.409> comments<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.310> different<00:01:35.700> colors<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
some comments of different colors and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.289 
some comments of different colors and
color<00:01:36.630> schemes<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.729> guess<00:01:38.729> I'll<00:01:38.909> decide

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
color schemes and I guess I'll decide

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.819 
color schemes and I guess I'll decide
from<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.280> then<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.390> main<00:01:42.600> feature<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.380> my

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
from that then the main feature of my

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.880 
from that then the main feature of my
base<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.700> two<00:01:45.000> towers<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.750> connected<00:01:46.380> by<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
base these two towers you connected by a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
base these two towers you connected by a
bridge<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.390> over<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.590> a

bridge and then over here I have a
couple<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.280> marks<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.149> one's<00:01:54.450> used<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
couple more marks this one's used to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.030 
couple more marks this one's used to
drop<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> paratroopers<00:01:57.649> then<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.860> one
