00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
got a lot of cool features too you've

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.810 
got a lot of cool features too you've
got<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.860> ability<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.220> change<00:01:46.369> pitch<00:01:46.670> will

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
got the ability to change pitch will

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.149 
got the ability to change pitch will
that<00:01:46.909> get<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.270> camera<00:01:47.630> right<00:01:47.780> there<00:01:47.840> stop<00:01:48.799> you

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
that get the camera right there stop you

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.490 
that get the camera right there stop you

take a photo here we'll make a little
click<00:01:51.649> sound<00:01:51.890> got<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.579> video<00:01:53.149> there<00:01:53.450> we've

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
click sound got the video there we've

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.649 
click sound got the video there we've
got<00:01:54.560> stop<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.159> start<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.490> rotor<00:01:55.670> blades<00:01:55.969> put

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
got stop and start the rotor blades put

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.149 
got stop and start the rotor blades put
your<00:01:56.750> flight<00:01:56.930> modes<00:01:57.170> here<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:57.619> smart<00:01:57.979> mode

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
your flight modes here so smart mode

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.130 
your flight modes here so smart mode
they<00:01:58.399> have<00:01:58.520> an<00:01:58.939> angle<00:01:59.390> mode<00:01:59.659> which<00:01:59.869> is<00:01:59.960> very

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
they have an angle mode which is very

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.889 
they have an angle mode which is very
similar<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.500> like<00:02:01.100> our<00:02:01.310> AP<00:02:02.000> mode<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.479> then

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
similar to like our AP mode and then

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.530 
similar to like our AP mode and then
also<00:02:03.110> return<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.680> home<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:04.909> on<00:02:05.299> the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
also return to home and then on the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.569 
also return to home and then on the
other<00:02:05.570> side<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.439> really<00:02:06.680> cool<00:02:06.829> feature<00:02:07.009> this

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
other side is a really cool feature this

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.520 
other side is a really cool feature this
is<00:02:07.759> kind<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:07.969> an<00:02:08.090> angle<00:02:08.450> limit<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.049> if<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.320> go

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
is kind of an angle limit so if you go

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.259 
is kind of an angle limit so if you go
to<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.769> bunny<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.190> model<00:02:10.910> will<00:02:10.970> actually

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
to the bunny the model will actually

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.030 
to the bunny the model will actually
have<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.390> higher<00:02:11.450> angle<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.829> like<00:02:12.920> your

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
have a higher angle just like your

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.100 
have a higher angle just like your
lawnmower<00:02:13.190> would<00:02:13.549> we<00:02:13.760> go<00:02:13.910> faster<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.570> then

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
lawnmower would we go faster and then

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.110 
lawnmower would we go faster and then
you<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:15.920> turtle<00:02:16.100> but<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.610> angle<00:02:16.850> limit

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
you go to the turtle but the angle limit

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.060 
you go to the turtle but the angle limit
reduces<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.840> can<00:02:17.989> have<00:02:18.200> full<00:02:18.440> stick<00:02:18.709> input

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
reduces so you can have full stick input

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.220 
reduces so you can have full stick input
but<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> lot<00:02:19.670> slower<00:02:19.910> forward<00:02:20.449> flight<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.139> it's

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
but a lot slower forward flight so it's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.390 
but a lot slower forward flight so it's
a<00:02:21.260> little<00:02:21.290> neat<00:02:21.620> feature<00:02:21.859> and<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.160> can<00:02:22.310> do

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
a little neat feature and you can do

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.150 
a little neat feature and you can do
that<00:02:22.519> on<00:02:22.579> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that on the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.710 
that on the
while<00:02:23.490> you're<00:02:23.610> flying<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.210> other<00:02:24.480> cool<00:02:24.660> thing

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
while you're flying the other cool thing

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.500 
while you're flying the other cool thing
about<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.230> short<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.190> radio<00:02:26.460> we've<00:02:27.300> got

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
about this short of the radio we've got

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.540 
about this short of the radio we've got
a<00:02:27.540> cartridge<00:02:28.020> style<00:02:28.260> battery<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.770> here<00:02:28.800> so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
a cartridge style battery in here so

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.610 
a cartridge style battery in here so
instead<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.390> standard<00:02:30.930> connection<00:02:31.470> you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
instead of a standard connection you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
instead of a standard connection you
just<00:02:31.770> pop<00:02:31.920> out<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.220> battery<00:02:32.550> nice<00:02:33.420> cartridge

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
just pop out the battery nice cartridge

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.540 
just pop out the battery nice cartridge
battery<00:02:34.080> easy<00:02:34.380> connection<00:02:34.860> back<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.310> it's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
battery easy connection back here it's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.850 
battery easy connection back here it's
kind<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.910> nice<00:02:36.060> III<00:02:36.540> style<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.740> it's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
kind of a nice III style but it's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.320 
kind of a nice III style but it's
integrated<00:02:38.310> into<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> battery<00:02:38.940> along<00:02:39.180> with

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
integrated into the battery along with

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.440 
integrated into the battery along with
the<00:02:39.420> balance<00:02:39.570> tab<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.700> 5400

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the balance tab and so it's a 5400

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.520 
the balance tab and so it's a 5400
milliamp<00:02:42.780> battery<00:02:42.810> you're<00:02:43.290> going<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.470> get

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
milliamp battery you're going to get

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.620 
milliamp battery you're going to get
about<00:02:43.710> 25<00:02:44.160> minutes<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.520> flight<00:02:44.670> time<00:02:44.700> now<00:02:45.570> do

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
about 25 minutes of flight time now do

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.930 
about 25 minutes of flight time now do
you<00:02:45.870> would<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.380> use<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> conventional<00:02:47.010> battery

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
you would you use a conventional battery

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.550 
you would you use a conventional battery
charger<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.660> charge<00:02:48.690> us<00:02:49.080> better<00:02:49.260> or<00:02:49.410> does<00:02:49.530> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
charger to charge us better or does it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560 
charger to charge us better or does it
come<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> phantom<00:02:51.330> does<00:02:51.450> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
come with like a like a phantom does it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.240 
come with like a like a phantom does it
come<00:02:51.690> with<00:02:51.720> its<00:02:52.020> own<00:02:52.140> custom<00:02:52.710> charger<00:02:53.100> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
come with its own custom charger to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220 
come with its own custom charger to
simplify<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.210> comes<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.630> balance<00:02:54.780> tab

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
simplify it it comes with a balance tab

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.260 
simplify it it comes with a balance tab
charger<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.610> an<00:02:56.700> extension<00:02:57.120> for

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
charger so you have an extension for

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.490 
charger so you have an extension for
that<00:02:57.390> balance<00:02:57.720> tab<00:02:57.900> that's<00:02:58.020> built<00:02:58.260> into<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
that balance tab that's built into the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.960 
that balance tab that's built into the
battery<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.430> hook<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.640> right<00:02:59.670> into

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
battery and you can hook it right into

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.780 
battery and you can hook it right into
your<00:03:00.150> into<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:00.840> standard<00:03:01.230> charger<00:03:01.670> that's<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
your into your standard charger that's a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
your into your standard charger that's a
plus<00:03:02.940> cuz<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.270> know<00:03:03.390> some<00:03:03.510> people<00:03:03.540> get

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
plus cuz I know some people get

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.660 
plus cuz I know some people get
frustrated<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:04.530> with<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> cartridge<00:03:05.370> style

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
frustrated with with a cartridge style

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.850 
frustrated with with a cartridge style
battery<00:03:06.060> because<00:03:06.300> you've<00:03:06.600> got<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.110> their

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
battery because you've got to have their

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.410 
battery because you've got to have their
charger<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.520> recharges<00:03:08.940> that's<00:03:09.120> not<00:03:09.330> an
