 go to the product page in case of 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.710
 are interested in a negative point with 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.630
 regarding this watch that is the playful 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.150
 really what they found is the delay 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.639
 at the moment that presents the time 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.020
 then for example you click 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.320
 here if someone asks them at the time 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.710
 have to wait for two 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.680
 minutes or the hour two minutes to be able 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.990
 perform then when we have seen 10 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.190
 and 10 or 10 Johnson the problem but 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.590
 when they start to come out in several 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.840
 numbers for example and they are 9 123 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.610
 you are possibly going to take a 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.710
 little bit of time but that's all 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.200
 It really is what I could comment with 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.240
