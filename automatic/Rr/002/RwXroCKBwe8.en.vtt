and he was a really nice guy so I was a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
and he was a really nice guy so I was a
really<00:01:56.069> good<00:01:56.219> time<00:01:56.429> going<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.789> there

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

really good time going down there
fishing<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.289> call<00:01:58.469> forward<00:01:58.859> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
fishing and I think I call forward and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
fishing and I think I call forward and
caught<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.429> but<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> think<00:02:00.450> he's<00:02:00.840> had<00:02:01.020> some

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
caught one but I think he's had some

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
caught one but I think he's had some
more<00:02:01.350> productive<00:02:01.950> days<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.429> there<00:02:02.609> before<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
more productive days down there before I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.399 
more productive days down there before I
think<00:02:03.149> he<00:02:03.210> pulled<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.600> six-pounder<00:02:04.259> down

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
think he pulled out a six-pounder down

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
think he pulled out a six-pounder down
there<00:02:04.619> once<00:02:04.859> so<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.429> think<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> biggest<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.450> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
there once so I think the biggest one I
