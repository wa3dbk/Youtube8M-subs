00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
funny we don't even really think about

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.350 
funny we don't even really think about
the<00:01:02.320> box<00:01:02.499> when<00:01:03.370> we<00:01:03.460> go<00:01:03.579> out<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.940> do<00:01:04.089> something

we<00:01:05.140> don't<00:01:05.230> start<00:01:05.800> by<00:01:05.950> saying<00:01:06.159> what<00:01:06.250> is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
we don't start by saying what is

we don't start by saying what is
everyone<00:01:06.580> else<00:01:06.610> doing<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.560> therefore<00:01:08.560> what

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
everyone else doing and therefore what

are<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:08.950> best<00:01:09.130> practices<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.760> what<00:01:10.150> should

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
are the best practices and what should

are the best practices and what should
we<00:01:10.420> do<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.600> think<00:01:10.870> we<00:01:11.170> look<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.470> say<00:01:11.710> what's<00:01:12.670> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
we do I think we look to say what's the

we do I think we look to say what's the
