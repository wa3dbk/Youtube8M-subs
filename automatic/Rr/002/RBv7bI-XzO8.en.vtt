00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.510 
out on their own if they spread out then
we'll<00:03:45.320> spend<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.620> lot<00:03:45.740> of<00:03:45.770> time<00:03:45.860> tracking<00:03:46.250> down

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
we'll spend a lot of time tracking down

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.610 
we'll spend a lot of time tracking down
where<00:03:46.730> they<00:03:46.940> are

this<00:03:53.620> project<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.280> an<00:03:54.549> experiment<00:03:55.090> where

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
this project is an experiment where

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.020 
this project is an experiment where
we're<00:03:55.390> learning<00:03:55.569> as<00:03:55.959> we<00:03:56.170> go<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:57.519> we<00:03:57.730> learned<00:03:57.909> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
we're learning as we go and we learned a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.399 
we're learning as we go and we learned a
lot<00:03:58.150> from<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.510> first<00:03:58.720> group<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.200> think

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
lot from the first group and I think

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:00.750 
lot from the first group and I think
we'll<00:03:59.530> continue<00:03:59.709> learning<00:04:00.040> from<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.400> second

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
we'll continue learning from the second

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.300 
we'll continue learning from the second
