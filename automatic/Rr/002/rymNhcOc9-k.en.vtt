00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:13.620
 Then let's pay a little more 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:19.740
 I tried to wrap it around my finger with the aluminum wheel I made earlier 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.950
 Here's an 8 point is completely and will do shops of people O have this way out of hand 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.280
 The store staff will roll with both hands 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:31.360
 So like this, the image of this kind of thing is quite 2 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.579
 But I think a good kana getting a little loose that's it when it is their own Suposupo 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.660
 There is a case to miss 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.250
 Because 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:46.040
 This time I will guide you to a form that you can easily do yourself 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:51.350
 It is the reaction of the main component of gel-off demover or its acetone to cotton 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.590
 Amount it is but to immerse I am immersed 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.720
 I agree 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.050
 It is too much if it is enough to drip down below Bichobicho too much. 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.380
 About 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.840
 I do not know this for a moment 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.940
 Some parts that are moist or slightly moist as a whole 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.130
 It is enough to remain in 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.690
 In in it was for sale, aluminum wheels 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 I know 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.759
 Hey you 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.350
 The center is dressed 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.430
 It is this no raster 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.950
 The finger I go Cotton 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.409
 It is a part of the nail, so it is better if this side or part of the skin is as close as possible from this part 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.380
 Because 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.490
 It feels like 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.490
 I am have 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.070
 I will come close 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:51.420
 If you stand like this, it's fine if you lift 5 pieces 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 It is a little hard to understand in the aluminum wheel because 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 Here tight and completely adhered to the finger 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.860
 Let me know 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.530
 Would you like 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:12.870
 We are in close contact, such as going to wound this way firm 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.400
 By and said, very course machine manners Toka Ima' because it firmly in close contact with here in this finger 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.350
 It is not state 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:25.050
 Really whether the Order from the production on the opposite side of the finger it is twist here a little 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:29.380
 Even if it bends, etc., it will be in the state which can not be taken out even if it moves it like this 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.210
 Saeki Other times the same way 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.290
 I want to 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.290
 Please leave 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.930
 This acetone if tweezers are at home 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.290
 I think that it is better to use tweezers, etc. because it is better not to touch as much as possible 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.890
 I will 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.890
 Also It is N town now of feeling I got in underneath the wind say Deyubi always this way 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:08.640
 If you say this course a little bit 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:14.850
 Then I want to leave about 10 minutes from now 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:21.420
 Such as the length of time that depending on the manufacturer's than I think whether there is a difference 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:24.690
 Once 10 minutes if there is no such as why therefore a measure especially anything of a manufacturer's chocolate 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.120
 Please try to use as a guide 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.120
 I will measure the time a little
