00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
medieval timelines so I figured why not

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.860 
medieval timelines so I figured why not
and<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.860> course<00:03:18.100> if<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.430> look<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.660> right

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and of course if you look on the right

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.390 
and of course if you look on the right
hand<00:03:20.080> corner<00:03:20.440> as<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.590> can<00:03:20.800> see<00:03:21.040> there<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.370> a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
hand corner as you can see there is a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.930 
hand corner as you can see there is a
step<00:03:21.850> bar<00:03:22.150> going<00:03:22.690> over<00:03:23.110> Mele<00:03:23.560> health<00:03:24.130> stealth

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
step bar going over Mele health stealth

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.600 
step bar going over Mele health stealth
and<00:03:25.180> raged<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.739> course<00:03:26.980> down<00:03:27.160> below<00:03:27.459> it

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
and raged and of course down below it

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.460 
and raged and of course down below it
has<00:03:27.640> some<00:03:27.880> modifiers<00:03:28.330> as<00:03:28.660> well<00:03:28.930> which<00:03:29.260> i<00:03:29.410> think

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
has some modifiers as well which i think

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.229 
has some modifiers as well which i think
is<00:03:29.739> pretty<00:03:29.920> cool<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.310> unique<00:03:30.489> for<00:03:30.820> Assassin's

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
is pretty cool and unique for Assassin's

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.030 
is pretty cool and unique for Assassin's
Creed<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.720> definitely<00:03:32.530> something<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:32.980> think

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
Creed and definitely something I think

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.940 
Creed and definitely something I think
the<00:03:33.489> game<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.700> been<00:03:33.970> eating<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.770> you<00:03:35.860> can

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
the game is been eating so as you can

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.140 
the game is been eating so as you can
see<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.459> kind<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.970> original

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
see that is kind of the original

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.910 
see that is kind of the original
obviously<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.050> would<00:03:38.140> be<00:03:38.260> blue<00:03:38.650> for<00:03:38.830> the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
obviously it would be blue for the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.430 
obviously it would be blue for the
original<00:03:39.280> color<00:03:39.520> because<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:39.850> changed<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.440> but

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
original color because I changed it but

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.979 
original color because I changed it but
