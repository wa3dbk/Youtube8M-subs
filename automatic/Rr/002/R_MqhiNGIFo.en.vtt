far as rigging goes and I'm going to go
back<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:08.280> darter<00:00:08.790> head<00:00:09.000> well

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
back to that little darter head well

back to that little darter head well
anywhere<00:00:10.260> from<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.590> quarter<00:00:11.190> ounce<00:00:11.490> to

anywhere from a quarter ounce to
three-eighths<00:00:12.240> again<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.780> lace<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:14.009> there

three-eighths again and lace it on there
very<00:00:14.160> very<00:00:14.370> carefully<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.150> interesting

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
very very carefully the interesting

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.500 
very very carefully the interesting
thing<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.839> when<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.949> fish<00:00:17.730> attack<00:00:18.180> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
thing is that when the fish attack this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.519 
thing is that when the fish attack this
they're<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> attack<00:00:19.050> up<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> head

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
they're going to attack up the head

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.170 
they're going to attack up the head
anyway<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.490> you've<00:00:20.609> got<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> lot<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> tail

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
anyway so you've got a lot of tail

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.450 
anyway so you've got a lot of tail
action<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:22.230> again<00:00:22.500> when<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.070> come<00:00:23.310> in

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
action but again when they come in

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.650 
action but again when they come in
they're<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> frontal<00:00:24.539> attack

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660

I<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> use<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.040> big<00:00:41.219> 8<00:00:41.460> inch<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.850> I'm

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
I like to use this big 8 inch or I'm

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
I like to use this big 8 inch or I'm
fishing<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> similar<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.100> way<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> fished

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
fishing it similar to I the way I fished

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.090 
fishing it similar to I the way I fished
the<00:00:44.700> jerk<00:00:44.940> shad<00:00:45.180> only<00:00:45.510> instead<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.590> really

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the jerk shad only instead of really

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680 
the jerk shad only instead of really
letting<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> sink<00:00:47.789> through<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> water<00:00:48.270> column

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
letting it sink through the water column

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.319 
letting it sink through the water column
and<00:00:48.899> counting<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:49.920> strikes<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.760> want

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and counting on my strikes there I want

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.670 
and counting on my strikes there I want
this<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.079> sink<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this one to actually sink more on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
this one to actually sink more on the
bottom<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.100> actually<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.640> rest<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
bottom and actually actually rest on the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.420 
bottom and actually actually rest on the
sand<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.860> I'll<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.219> I'll<00:00:56.309> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
sand and then what I'll do is I'll just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.310 
sand and then what I'll do is I'll just
kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.670> snap<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> rod<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.719> small

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
kind of snap the rod a little bit small

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
kind of snap the rod a little bit small
though<00:00:58.699> torques<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.629> reel<00:01:00.809> handle

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
though torques with the the reel handle

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.170 
though torques with the the reel handle
to<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> jump<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.980> pop<00:01:02.190> fishing<00:01:03.030> with

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to make it jump and pop fishing with

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
to make it jump and pop fishing with
again<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.110> garter<00:01:04.680> head<00:01:04.949> about

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
again the little garter head about

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730 
again the little garter head about
anywhere<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> quarter<00:01:07.020> ounce<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
anywhere from a quarter ounce on up to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
anywhere from a quarter ounce on up to
about<00:01:07.770> three-eighths<00:01:08.340> ounces<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.479> again<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
about three-eighths ounces but again the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.929 
about three-eighths ounces but again the
contrast<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> jerk<00:01:11.520> bait<00:01:11.700> where<00:01:11.850> I'm

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
contrast to the jerk bait where I'm

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.480 
contrast to the jerk bait where I'm
throwing<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.659> planning<00:01:13.260> on

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
throwing out and just planning on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
throwing out and just planning on
strikes<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> sink<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> Gulf's<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
strikes on the sink with the Gulf's and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.990 
strikes on the sink with the Gulf's and
more<00:01:16.799> especially<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.220> big<00:01:17.430> 8<00:01:17.580> inch<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.880> what

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
more especially this big 8 inch or what

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.429 
more especially this big 8 inch or what
I'm<00:01:18.090> doing<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.540> working<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.020> closer<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
I'm doing is working it closer to the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.890 
I'm doing is working it closer to the
bottom<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.799> catch<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.220> halibut<00:01:21.060> sand<00:01:21.720> bass

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
bottom you catch a halibut sand bass

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
bottom you catch a halibut sand bass
calico<00:01:22.409> bass<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.040> sea<00:01:23.250> bass<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
calico bass and even like sea bass on it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:32.160 
calico bass and even like sea bass on it
but<00:01:23.850> keep<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> towards<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> bottom

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.899 

now<00:01:33.170> remember<00:01:33.500> folks<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.920> key<00:01:34.130> on<00:01:34.400> the

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
now remember folks the key on the

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.180 
now remember folks the key on the
sandworm<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:36.020> keep<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.409> along<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.040> bottom

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
sandworm is to keep it along the bottom

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.370 
sandworm is to keep it along the bottom
and<00:01:37.490> just<00:01:37.610> kind<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.790> creep<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.300> pop<00:01:38.570> pop<00:01:39.170> it

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
and just kind of creep it and pop pop it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.210 
and just kind of creep it and pop pop it
once<00:01:39.560> in<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.740> while<00:01:39.860> like<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:40.280> there<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.090> go
