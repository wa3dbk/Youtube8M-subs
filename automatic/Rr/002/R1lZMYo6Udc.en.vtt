00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.840
 hello everyone came to us again 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.009
 version of the lamp fenix hp 30 which 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.760
 just a few days ago was 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.580
 Announced from the manufacturer and in a hurry 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.039
 familiarize you with this new product and so 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.619
 caught my eye at first sight it's two 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.220
 such interesting things here the first is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.590
 LED application cree xm-l 2 min 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 brightness here in this most modern on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.340
 today's second LED is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.160
 powered lantern on lithium cells 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:46.370
 power is batteries 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:49.770
 1862 pieces or 4 cr123 batteries 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.920
 consider in more detail the sumpter since 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.660
 head part 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 so prune ki said installed 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.440
 led cree xm-l u2 cool white 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.339
 the light itself is the main part of the size 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 much like a flashlight fenix e15 to the lantern 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:14.939
 will be included with the same 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:20.520
 the diffusing lens is the same cord from 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.990
 difference should be added 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.409
 such an orange button which 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.590
 includes the brightest mode so 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.369
 consider in more detail 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.340
 Turning off the flashlight from 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.299
 switching modes and so flashlight two 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 buttons are gray big them orange by 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.140
 smaller she stands for the dimensions of the lantern 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.490
 for more convenient inclusion in gloves 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.610
 so cerrad is not responsible for the inclusion 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.640
 Anta lights to turn on the flashlight we 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.240
 press and let the button for shutdown 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.009
 flashlight 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.110
 press and hold the button approximately 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.079
 second and is responsible for switching 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.680
 modes so the first mode is the most economical 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:06.600
 it's four elements 300 hours next 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.990
 we have a regime of 65 thirty-two hours 40 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.899
 minutes 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.069
 the next mode is average already 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:18.319
 there is an element of 12 hours and a fourth mode 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:21.950
 powerful is 500 lumens 3:50 fifth mode 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.560
 900 moment is activated only by pressing 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.959
 this orange button and only works 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.189
 while in this button hold that is this 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.829
 mode can be enabled when the flashlight 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.609
 off from off state whether 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.780
 cover is twisted by some other mode 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.060
 promoted click click cut and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.750
 while we hold this button it is lit 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.359
 the brightest mode samovaly mean 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.900
 turn 6 degrees that 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.450
 comfortable enough in any situation 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.299
 further the lantern has a pretty long 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.329
 cord about two meters and and such 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.280
 battery pack itself gradually part 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.659
 detached will be able to evaluate the battery 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.470
 block with this connector 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:08.290
 consider in more detail 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:12.519
 the battery pack itself was similar to 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:16.250
 cycle lights but has a few 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:20.269
 major differences first in itself 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.970
 blog can be attached to the belt of trousers or 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.560
 nourishing in your clothes pocket from the cold what 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.400
 allow body length 1 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.260
 save your batteries from 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.419
 fast scouting in the heat in the cold 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.269
 season 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.530
 By itself, this clip is made of 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.209
 polished stainless steel 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.090
 have a pretty good aesthetic 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:46.220
 view and at the same time are enough 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:49.760
 the strongest most battery pack we have 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.120
 two batteries are located 18:50 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.349
 either 4 cr123 batteries not included 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.349
 included not included 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.500
 by itself was tight enough 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.580
 the word in itself is critical lantern 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.520
 announced ip 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:13.730
 6 that is, it withstands atmospheric 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.790
 precipitation as well as temporary immersion 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.700
 under the water 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.640
 also on the battery pack there is an indicator 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.240
 the discharge is more accurate than the charge-discharge charge 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.360
 batteries here are installed 4 LEDs 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.860
 which percentage show an approximate 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.280
 battery charge now like us 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.100
 see 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.540
 rooms discharged by 50 percent and row 2 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.630
 led of 4 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:45.380
 and there is also such an interesting solution 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.630
 like everywhere else is charging outlet 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.010
 various device phones 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:55.760
 tablets and navigators and so on 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:05:00.400
 through the usual there are whites there are 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.390
 computers and how to use it 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.330
 connect the phone or another 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.310
 the device itself is behind it 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.340
 pressing some but while I work if 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.630
 click which is responsible for the shows 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.630
 dictator so support about 3 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.530
 seconds see this we went swept 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.030
 in the case let the charge process go for 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.690
 order to turn off the charge process where 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:30.650
 either simply pull out the cord and 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.890
 charge process in seconds 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.979
 automatically stop or press and 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:43.460
 hold the button for 3 seconds and the process 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:46.400
 the charge stopped and so in more detail 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.410
 about the characteristics of the lamp can be read 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.229
 will be a reference which will be 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.930
 posted under the video also near 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.669
 time we will test this lantern to ours 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.620
 on our test basement flashlight and you 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.220
 you can see how he is 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.070
 really rian shines on big 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.660
 distance and basically thank you all for 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.640
 overview 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.940
 sleep for new items found on our channel 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.169
 as soon as the video appears shameful video with 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.169
 dough necessarily hunger
