 new video I'm going to show you a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.540
 new figure of the ruby twist I 'm going to 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.050
 teach how to do 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.730
 the good gun I do not know anymore when the 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.160
 next video but calm that I'm going to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.250
 keep uploading videos of whatever 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.660
 blond piano the rubik twist I do not know but 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.220
 I will keep going up but I do not know with what 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.259
 regularity 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.410
 It's good, I'm going to teach them how to do 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.630
 three types of guns in different 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.610
 videos or even four I do not know but in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 principle are going to be three and this is the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.530
 First 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.710
 hey it's pretty easy ok he taught me to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.710
 do 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.760
 well let's start so we're going to 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.090
 catch our robbie keane done a 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.550
 line and let's put it like that looking 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.920
 down the tip and let's move two 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.890
 times 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 one and two we're always going to have to 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.979
 move any part twice 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.269
 it's worth once we have it that way we're going to 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:06.990
 count 1 2 and 3 and let's cut here 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:11.100
 twice is worth here 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.820
 1 and 2 and the way that we have left like this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.490
 now let's count 1 and 2 and we're going to 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.670
 cut here twice 2 times again 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.670
 here 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.180
 and two so that we stay is this what 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.070
 that has to be 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.619
 now let's tell this and we're going to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.590
 to cut through here twice again I to 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.520
 just as it is here we are going to cut this 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:46.429
 what is this this upwards 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.200
 twice one and two and now that we 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.570
 I would touch to do this now we would play 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.899
 follow here a straight line so you 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 we have to count 1 and 2 and cut like this 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:01.340
 that we counted 1 2 and we cut through here 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340
 one 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.130
 and two so that we have a line 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.039
 straight now how many how many 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.200
 little triangles we have to tell 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.270
 2 3 4 and 5 and twist 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.280
 we count, so we take in our 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.460
 country we counted 1 2 3 4 and 5 and cut by 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.970
 here 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.220
 over here twice one and two always two 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650
 times and we are leaving the chair 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.550
 way and now the only thing that we would have left 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.010
 do this but I do not know if you look 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.560
 if you cut is here to put here 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.340
 what would this line be worth if you count 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.360
 over here once and twice hits and we do not 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.370
 let's put them in so 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.140
 what are you going to do in the following a 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:59.080
 natural fact you have if you are going to tell 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:03.819
 1 2 3 4 and 5 and you're going to cut here two 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.000
 Sometimes it is worth 1 2 3 4 and 5 and here 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.190
 twice 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.280
 one and the first one that we have this 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.520
 and now you're going to cut here 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.220
 twice and you will be left directly 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.360
 this way you see because what we are going to 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.140
 do is on the web 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.140
 here 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.500
 a 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.090
 and two and we have not the gun 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.580
 number one form 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.709
 then done good I do not know when 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.150
 upload the next video but good give it to 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.790
