the<00:02:14.989> cable<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.620> don't<00:02:16.069> think<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.310> will<00:02:16.459> be

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
the cable in I don't think I will be

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.350 
the cable in I don't think I will be
it's<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.330> mini<00:02:17.569> USB<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:19.489> yeah<00:02:19.670> guys<00:02:19.909> this<00:02:20.150> has
