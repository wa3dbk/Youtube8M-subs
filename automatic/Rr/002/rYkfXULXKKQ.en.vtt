going<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.900> weld<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.290> on<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.880> other<00:01:50.000> side

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
going to weld that on the other side

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.999 
going to weld that on the other side
will<00:01:50.420> be<00:01:50.540> similar<00:01:50.840> though<00:01:51.259> it's<00:01:51.500> got<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> little

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
will be similar though it's got a little

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.190 
will be similar though it's got a little
bit<00:01:52.159> different<00:01:52.700> bend<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.180> than<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.960> one

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
bit different bend in it than this one

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.080 
bit different bend in it than this one
for<00:01:54.470> some<00:01:54.649> clearance<00:01:54.979> issues<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:55.640> basically

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
for some clearance issues but basically

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.210 
for some clearance issues but basically
that's<00:01:56.299> what<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:56.689> going<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.899> look<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.220> so

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220
