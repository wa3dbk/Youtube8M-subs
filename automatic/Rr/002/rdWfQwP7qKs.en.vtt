00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.149
 hi friends today more information of the 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.220
 great blows and this is courtesy of a thousand 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.920
 modes that has discovered information 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.630
 about new functions that are going to 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.080
 come this is the bible that discovered the 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.490
 12 new actions that exist within the 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.320
 game within the servers that 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.269
 found and then we will go talking 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.130
 the some pumps with the first the 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.419
 first refer or contact or jeff that 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.839
 it's going to be a new one that we already know 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.429
 let's go with the second the second is 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.679
 regarding a new contact to a 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.180
 contact lester 2 then here like that 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.520
 they do not know if it's going to be a new contact 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.020
 this we say remains as a mystery but 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.270
 they also do it as a new contact 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.890
 that of unknown name in the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.650
 next the next is to activate 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.090
 an avalanche then here because the 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.210
 avalanches can be debris 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.370
 they can be of sand mud then 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.900
 let's say that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.580
 is very open, this is not to activate 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.530
 an avalanche we do not know to science 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.420
 certain where will it be in what kind of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.610
 blow of great blow will be but good 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.080
 refers to an avalanche the next 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.080
 it's more interesting because it's a 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.390
 tsunami and the tsunami well as well 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.460
 says his name this nothing else refers 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.650
 to what is then a very big wave a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.270
 flood by part of the sea by part 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.280
 of a lake probably also in a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 lake there may be a tsunami would be something 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.160
 more difficult but with some 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.050
 suitable conditions because it is not 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.310
 can also achieve then here is 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.020
 is a mine the best is going to be a great 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.750
 hit that is located at a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 side of the sea or next to a lake or not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 I think it's the inside of a building 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.869
 that flood there and make some 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.479
 part as an effect of that I do not think so 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.070
 but then we must see the next 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.720
 refers to the fact that the police and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.700
 military will not have access to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.440
 some areas then it will look like 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 security zones something very technical that 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.490
 have out there in some big blow that 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 Well, we just mentioned it because then 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 there the following was listed 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.030
 refers to the new interior of a bank or 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.950
 is going to be a new interior and so 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.250
 also a news and a bit let's say 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.740
 that minor in this part 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.540
 this news I pons when done 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.660
 enter a lobby there is always a jp and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.190
 some have 16 15 20 or something or when 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.590
 we finish a mission they also give us that 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.450
 it's 20 you know what the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.480
 meaning of that jp and they are going to be 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.190
 used to have access to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.440
 big shots of a higher level 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.270
 then we are going to need those job 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.709
 points that will accumulate from 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.320
 according to the jobs that we go 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.690
 doing in the next one because this one is going to 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.840
 apply to call the vehicles of 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.760
 pegasus but we will be able to order them 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.470
 in our location that we are or 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.790
 whether we are in a big blow in a 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.770
 specific location we're going to 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.440
 be able to call and they will appear on one side 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.500
 from us or very close without having to 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.730
 go to the places that we already know now 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.360
 let's say the emergency vehicles 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.430
 they will have a one time a quantity 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.830
 of limited time some then it's 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.350
 everything this refers to is this function 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.270
 that they are going to have a very 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.250
 limited for example 30 seconds 40 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.930
 seconds I do not know a minute two minutes 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.070
 this function will allow you to unite with 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.709
 a certain amount of time 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.670
 when you're almost dead or have 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.830
 very little 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.290
 with little life let's say it's going to be very 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.569
 good to free yourself from there of an area 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.180
 of danger in the next one because this 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.830
 suggests let's say there are areas of 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.200
 department where you will not be able to 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.000
 enter while you are planning what 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.280
 are the big blows this is not very 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.650
 clear and the latter refers that you're going to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.390
 can enter the low hand more club and you go 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.640
 to be able to interact with its interior 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.709
 let's say you're going to have access and you're going to 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.569
 can out there get some details that 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.580
 They are unknown but then you are going to 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.840
 to be able to do good joaquin this was 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.840
 my report goodbye 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.390
 how good 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.349
 and it has
