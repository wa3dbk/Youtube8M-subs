this product that you have here except
the<00:00:46.739> only<00:00:46.830> difference<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.489> witches<00:00:47.970> were

quite<00:00:48.659> a<00:00:48.690> bit<00:00:48.839> smaller<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> thought<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
quite a bit smaller so I thought to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.590 
quite a bit smaller so I thought to
myself<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.839> would<00:00:52.799> try<00:00:53.100> today<00:00:53.600> taking

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
myself that I would try today taking

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
mesquite wood chips I had on hand I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.500 
mesquite wood chips I had on hand I
would<00:01:00.210> combine<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.720> in<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.869> pan<00:01:01.110> like<00:01:01.440> this

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
would combine it in a pan like this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.980 
would combine it in a pan like this
using<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.780> propane<00:01:04.199> torch<00:01:05.450> and<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.570> find<00:01:06.840> just

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
any old cover on there it kind of helped

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.950 
any old cover on there it kind of helped
keep<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.500> smoke<00:01:43.300> inside<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.480> chamber<00:01:44.810> where

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
keep the smoke inside the chamber where

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.410 
keep the smoke inside the chamber where
I<00:01:44.990> want<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.620> just<00:01:46.220> any<00:01:46.430> old<00:01:46.670> wait<00:01:46.910> for<00:01:47.240> now

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
I want it and just any old wait for now

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.590 
I want it and just any old wait for now
just<00:01:47.780> experimenting<00:01:48.410> again<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.090> did<00:01:50.390> that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
just experimenting again so I did that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.210 
just experimenting again so I did that
and<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:51.260> seemed<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.530> work<00:01:51.650> out<00:01:51.770> pretty<00:01:51.830> good

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
and that seemed to work out pretty good

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.340 
and that seemed to work out pretty good
and<00:01:52.460> I'll<00:01:52.550> show<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.910> result<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:54.230> the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
and I'll show you the result in the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.480 
and I'll show you the result in the
triger<00:01:56.290> there<00:01:57.290> we<00:01:57.470> go<00:01:57.620> that's<00:01:58.010> how<00:01:58.160> it<00:01:58.280> looks

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
triger there we go that's how it looks

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.320 
triger there we go that's how it looks
so<00:01:59.030> this<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.450> my<00:01:59.570> maximum<00:02:00.020> at<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.440> moment<00:02:01.300> so<00:02:02.300> I

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
so this is my maximum at the moment so I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.480 
so this is my maximum at the moment so I
just<00:02:02.600> like<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.960> said<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.470> took<00:02:03.650> my<00:02:04.010> own

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
just like I said I just took my own

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
into the chamber of the show Jeff I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.180 
into the chamber of the show Jeff I
turned<00:02:14.210> off<00:02:14.360> thermostat<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.590> get<00:02:15.740> more<00:02:15.980> air

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
turned off thermostat to get more air

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.460 
turned off thermostat to get more air
the<00:02:16.370> bolt<00:02:16.580> here<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.960> result<00:02:18.320> I'm

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the bolt here and this is the result I'm

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.500 
the bolt here and this is the result I'm
getting<00:02:18.830> now<00:02:19.640> if<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:20.000> getting<00:02:20.180> too<00:02:20.390> much

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
getting now if I'm getting too much

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.810 
getting now if I'm getting too much
smoke<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.990> can<00:02:21.140> simply<00:02:21.530> turn<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.310> down<00:02:22.550> let<00:02:22.760> me

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
smoke I can simply turn that down let me

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.130 
smoke I can simply turn that down let me
get<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.090> better<00:02:23.210> position<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.780> I'll<00:02:23.930> show

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
get in a better position and I'll show

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.640 
get in a better position and I'll show
you<00:02:24.170> how<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.530> looks<00:02:26.080> okay<00:02:27.080> right<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:27.440> we're

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
you how that looks okay right now we're

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.050 
you how that looks okay right now we're
at<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.860> maximum<00:02:28.310> setting<00:02:28.670> here<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:28.850> I'll

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
at the maximum setting here and I'll

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.690 
at the maximum setting here and I'll
just<00:02:29.090> slowly<00:02:29.420> turn<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.840> down

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
just slowly turn it down

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.229 
just slowly turn it down
so<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.300> can<00:02:32.420> see<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.720> effect<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
so you can see the effect this is a

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.250 
so you can see the effect this is a
basically<00:02:38.239> really<00:02:38.480> good<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:38.780> me<00:02:38.870> because<00:02:39.050> you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
basically really good for me because you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.050 
basically really good for me because you
can<00:02:39.410> do<00:02:39.530> cold<00:02:39.770> smoking<00:02:40.250> or<00:02:40.489> whatever<00:02:40.940> you'd

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
can do cold smoking or whatever you'd

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.339 
can do cold smoking or whatever you'd
like<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.209> do<00:02:41.420> I'm<00:02:41.660> just<00:02:41.840> trying<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.140> add<00:02:42.319> a

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
like to do I'm just trying to add a

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.690 
like to do I'm just trying to add a
little<00:02:42.590> bit<00:02:42.680> more<00:02:42.770> smoke<00:02:43.250> flavor<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.640> my

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
little bit more smoke flavor to my

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.240 
little bit more smoke flavor to my
products<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.209> make<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.950> would<00:02:46.130> be

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
products that I make and that would be

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.840 
products that I make and that would be
what<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.520> rheostat<00:02:46.790> turned<00:02:47.209> right<00:02:47.390> off<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.550> I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
what the rheostat turned right off so I

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.100 
what the rheostat turned right off so I
just<00:02:49.910> wanted<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.450> give<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.720> an<00:02:50.840> update<00:02:50.959> on

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
there I think I'll keep playing with it

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.260 
there I think I'll keep playing with it
to<00:02:54.200> get<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> solution<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.130> like<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:55.940> far<00:02:56.180> I'm
