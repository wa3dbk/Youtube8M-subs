00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.060

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.480
 high fleet clouds 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.810
 and higher each time until suddenly 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.270
 feel as if two soft arms 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.920
 they gave him a huge hug 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.050
 who leaves it on a soft pillow 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.950
 go somewhere else 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.810
 I would like to visit the man of the moon 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.730
 I would like to bury my flag in the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:45.500
 moon like a real astronaut 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.500

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.180

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.690
 good you'll have to do it if you want to go 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.890
 the moon only climbs the rocket knows the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.350
 path 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.350

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.640
 I scream at you 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.310
 but the little cloud could not hear what 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.250
 he said busti because the rocket had already 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.840
 started to roar with his passenger the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.819

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.819

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.480

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.270
 already already 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.260
