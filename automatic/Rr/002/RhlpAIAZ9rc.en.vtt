game and your buddy was casting this

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.310 
game and your buddy was casting this
thought<00:03:46.240> you<00:03:46.360> saw<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.930> was<00:03:47.020> kind<00:03:47.290> of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
thought you saw so it was kind of

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.060 
thought you saw so it was kind of
annoying<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.700> we<00:03:49.260> kind<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.320> kept<00:03:50.680> making<00:03:50.920> some

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
annoying so we kind of kept making some

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.220 
annoying so we kind of kept making some
revisions<00:03:53.790> for<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:54.910> version<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.540> we<00:03:56.110> had

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
revisions for this version that we had

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.810 
revisions for this version that we had
to<00:03:56.320> be<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.590> chase<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.130> mouse<00:03:57.250> cursor<00:03:57.520> around

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
to be and chase the mouse cursor around

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.210 
to be and chase the mouse cursor around
and<00:03:58.240> we<00:03:59.200> really<00:03:59.470> liked<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.620> way<00:03:59.800> it<00:03:59.830> looked<00:03:59.920> we

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
and we really liked the way it looked we

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.340 
and we really liked the way it looked we
thought<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.550> you<00:04:00.760> know<00:04:00.880> it<00:04:01.660> was<00:04:01.930> felt<00:04:02.140> really

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
thought it you know it was felt really

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.260 
thought it you know it was felt really
powerful<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.100> didn't<00:04:03.430> take<00:04:03.640> too<00:04:03.850> much<00:04:04.000> space

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
powerful but didn't take too much space

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.199 
powerful but didn't take too much space
up<00:04:04.300> on<00:04:04.570> screen<00:04:05.340> but<00:04:06.340> mechanically<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.090> was<00:04:07.180> a

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
up on screen but mechanically it was a

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.690 
up on screen but mechanically it was a
little<00:04:07.390> rough<00:04:07.740> we<00:04:08.740> didn't<00:04:09.040> like<00:04:09.190> having<00:04:09.520> a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
little rough we didn't like having a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.760 
little rough we didn't like having a
channel<00:04:09.970> skill<00:04:10.300> for<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.510> Crusader<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.620> we

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
channel skill for the Crusader and we

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.960 
channel skill for the Crusader and we
want<00:04:11.950> him<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.070> be<00:04:12.160> able<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.340> move<00:04:12.430> around<00:04:12.610> and

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
want him to be able to move around and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.259 
want him to be able to move around and
you<00:04:13.240> know<00:04:13.330> hit<00:04:13.480> things<00:04:13.740> so<00:04:14.760> we<00:04:15.760> thought<00:04:15.970> well

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
you know hit things so we thought well

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.610 
you know hit things so we thought well
what<00:04:16.419> happens<00:04:16.690> if<00:04:16.750> we<00:04:16.840> gave<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.410> know<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
what happens if we gave you know the
