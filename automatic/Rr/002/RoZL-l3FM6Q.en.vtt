00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.910 

hmm<00:01:30.380> very<00:01:30.740> interesting

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.830 

why<00:01:35.920> do<00:01:35.980> chemists<00:01:36.520> call<00:01:36.640> helium<00:01:37.030> curium<00:01:37.690> and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
why do chemists call helium curium and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.380 
why do chemists call helium curium and
barium<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.620> medical<00:01:38.950> elements<00:01:39.310> because<00:01:40.090> if

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
barium the medical elements because if

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.480 
barium the medical elements because if
you<00:01:40.570> can't<00:01:40.780> helium<00:01:41.140> or<00:01:41.290> curium<00:01:41.680> you'll<00:01:42.100> bury

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
you can't helium or curium you'll bury

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.030 
you can't helium or curium you'll bury
him<00:01:42.820> hmm<00:01:43.480> why<00:01:43.930> do<00:01:43.990> chemists<00:01:44.530> call<00:01:44.680> helium

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
him hmm why do chemists call helium

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.340 
him hmm why do chemists call helium
curium<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:45.880> barium<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.660> medical<00:01:46.990> elements

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
curium and barium the medical elements

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.680 
curium and barium the medical elements
because<00:01:48.100> if<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.580> can't<00:01:48.820> helium<00:01:49.150> or<00:01:49.300> curium

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
because if you can't helium or curium

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:03.389 
because if you can't helium or curium
you<00:01:50.080> barium
