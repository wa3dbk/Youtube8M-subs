00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
ability to read them themselves

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.890 
ability to read them themselves
or<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.439> that<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.859> that<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.400> closed<00:02:47.900> know

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
or is that is that kind of a closed know

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.809 
or is that is that kind of a closed know

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
that a pet is a pet so they would be

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.059 
that a pet is a pet so they would be
fixed<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.390> thing<00:02:51.599> but<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.829> want<00:02:53.010> a

fixed kind of thing but if you want a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.770 
fixed kind of thing but if you want a
reading<00:02:53.310> rights<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.390> course<00:02:54.599> they've

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
reading rights and of course they've

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.229 
reading rights and of course they've
been<00:02:54.959> here<00:02:55.109> okay<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.810> you'd<00:02:57.810> probably<00:02:58.049> get<00:02:58.319> a

health or anything like that but you

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.500 
health or anything like that but you
know<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.950> meets<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.159> Bengals<00:03:08.519> standard<00:03:09.030> in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
know that meets the Bengals standard in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.820 
know that meets the Bengals standard in
in<00:03:10.049> terms<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.530> conformation<00:03:11.190> naturally

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
in terms of conformation naturally

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.550 
in terms of conformation naturally
these<00:03:13.550> are<00:03:13.760> show<00:03:13.970> followed<00:03:14.540> enough<00:03:14.840> these<00:03:15.350> are

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
these are show followed enough these are

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.700 
these are show followed enough these are
support<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:17.450> there<00:03:18.380> much<00:03:18.650> variation<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.610> their

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
support is there much variation in their

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.410 
support is there much variation in their
appearance<00:03:21.710> like<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.280> sports<00:03:22.580> and<00:03:22.970> stuff<00:03:23.090> are

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
appearance like the sports and stuff are

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.670 
appearance like the sports and stuff are
incredible<00:03:23.960> yeah<00:03:25.060> she's<00:03:26.060> not<00:03:26.810> quite<00:03:27.110> rotated

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
incredible yeah she's not quite rotated

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.080 
incredible yeah she's not quite rotated
the<00:03:27.770> way<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.920> would<00:03:28.220> like<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> center

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
the way I would like so the center

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.180 
the way I would like so the center
should<00:03:29.270> be<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.450> little<00:03:29.660> bit<00:03:29.870> lighter<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.710> a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
should be a little bit lighter and a

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.530 
should be a little bit lighter and a
little<00:03:31.430> bit<00:03:31.610> blacker<00:03:32.060> around<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.660> outside

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
little bit blacker around the outside

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.180 
little bit blacker around the outside
they<00:03:35.540> feed<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.260> one<00:03:36.410> but<00:03:36.560> she<00:03:36.770> shows<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
they feed on that one but she shows the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.600 
they feed on that one but she shows the
top<00:03:37.400> floor<00:03:40.840> get<00:03:41.840> many<00:03:42.410> varieties<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.130> colors

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
top floor get many varieties of colors

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.240 
top floor get many varieties of colors
and<00:03:43.850> patterns<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.480> they've<00:03:45.380> got<00:03:45.530> silvers<00:03:45.980> and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
and patterns and they've got silvers and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.780 
and patterns and they've got silvers and
it<00:03:46.520> snows<00:03:46.790> as<00:03:47.090> well

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
it snows as well

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.850 
it snows as well
here<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.910> can<00:03:50.120> see<00:03:50.330> kind<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.990> weird<00:03:51.320> black

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
here you can see kind of weird black

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.510 
here you can see kind of weird black
around<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.280> outside<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.880> centers<00:03:53.270> over

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
around the outside and centers over

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.020 
around the outside and centers over
that's<00:03:55.520> what<00:03:55.730> we're<00:03:55.910> looking<00:03:56.210> for
