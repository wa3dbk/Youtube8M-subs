I'm tired the first immiscible orem box

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.580 
I'm tired the first immiscible orem box
except<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.599> ones<00:00:28.840> that<00:00:28.960> are

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.700 

we<00:00:33.770> can<00:00:33.920> all<00:00:34.040> slip<00:00:35.140> that<00:00:36.140> does<00:00:36.440> like

we can all slip that does like
ridiculously<00:00:37.490> minor<00:00:37.820> damage<00:00:39.520> come<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.640> get

ridiculously minor damage come and get

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.650

me
slipped<00:00:43.079> without<00:00:43.410> would<00:00:43.500> call<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.190> actual

slipped without would call like actual

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.600 
slipped without would call like actual
programming<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.420> guess<00:00:45.920> okay<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.160> didn't<00:00:47.460> know

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
programming I guess okay I didn't know

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.020 
programming I guess okay I didn't know
that<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.120> randomly<00:00:48.540> phased<00:00:48.900> out<00:00:52.940> music<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that just randomly phased out music is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.380 
that just randomly phased out music is
because<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.540> also<00:00:54.660> pretty<00:00:54.930> good

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
because it's also pretty good

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.990 
because it's also pretty good
I<00:00:57.010> look<00:00:58.010> like<00:00:58.190> oh<00:00:58.309> we're<00:00:58.430> getting<00:00:58.520> motion<00:00:58.730> for

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
I look like oh we're getting motion for

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
I look like oh we're getting motion for
me<00:01:01.870> something<00:01:02.870> would<00:01:03.320> later<00:01:03.530> or<00:01:03.800> something

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.870 

all<00:01:12.820> right<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.240> em<00:01:13.420> potatoes<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:15.580> actually

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
all right to em potatoes it's actually

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.180 
all right to em potatoes it's actually
better<00:01:16.060> than<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.300> heart<00:01:16.480> piece<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:16.840> think<00:01:17.190> maybe

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
better than a heart piece I think maybe

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.710 
better than a heart piece I think maybe
not<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.670> don't<00:01:18.880> know<00:01:19.030> how<00:01:19.180> much<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.480> heel<00:01:19.690> I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
not I don't know how much the heel I

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.870 
not I don't know how much the heel I
guess<00:01:20.100> remember<00:01:21.100> how<00:01:21.190> much<00:01:21.310> damage<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.730> had

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
guess remember how much damage I had

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.390 
guess remember how much damage I had
before<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.240> hopes<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:23.040> wish<00:01:24.040> these<00:01:24.190> workers

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
before that hopes I wish these workers

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
before that hopes I wish these workers
red<00:01:24.729> shells<00:01:25.090> instead<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.720> red<00:01:26.200> green<00:01:26.560> show

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
red shells instead of red green show

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.310 
red shells instead of red green show
yeah<00:01:29.490> I'm<00:01:30.490> not<00:01:30.670> sure<00:01:31.000> makes<00:01:31.420> sense<00:01:31.780> right<00:01:31.960> I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
yeah I'm not sure makes sense right I

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.050 
yeah I'm not sure makes sense right I
mean<00:01:32.470> that's<00:01:32.590> something<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:33.130> can<00:01:33.400> argue<00:01:33.790> that's

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
mean that's something I can argue that's

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.940 
mean that's something I can argue that's
just<00:01:34.479> something<00:01:34.900> they<00:01:35.140> stole<00:01:35.380> from<00:01:35.410> sonic

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
just something they stole from sonic

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.890 
just something they stole from sonic
games<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:39.210> they're<00:01:40.210> supposed<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.720> be<00:01:40.869> a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
games and they're supposed to be a

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.580 
games and they're supposed to be a
cutscene<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:41.830> somehow<00:01:42.100> missed<00:01:43.590> because

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
cutscene that I somehow missed because

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.990 
cutscene that I somehow missed because
it<00:01:44.740> doesn't<00:01:45.100> really<00:01:45.250> make<00:01:45.460> sense<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.820> I'm

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
it doesn't really make sense that I'm

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.609 
it doesn't really make sense that I'm
just<00:01:46.210> preparing<00:01:46.360> fighting<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:46.900> purple<00:01:47.200> Bowser

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
just preparing fighting a purple Bowser

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.440 
just preparing fighting a purple Bowser
I<00:01:48.100> don't<00:01:48.490> know<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.790> these<00:01:48.940> were<00:01:49.119> like

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
I don't know that these were like

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.139 
I don't know that these were like
unlockable<00:01:50.259> color<00:01:51.100> schemes<00:01:51.550> after<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.030> be

controversy over who's better because it

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.560 
controversy over who's better because it
seems<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.170> have<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.320> group<00:05:29.770> in<00:05:30.040> such<00:05:30.310> every<00:05:31.150> way

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.450 

if<00:05:34.570> only<00:05:34.810> there<00:05:35.260> was<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.470> third<00:05:35.770> dimension<00:05:36.340> we

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
if only there was a third dimension we

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.820 
if only there was a third dimension we
could<00:05:36.640> run<00:05:36.790> away<00:05:36.910> to

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.780 

this<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:42.010> earthbound<00:05:42.220> canon<00:05:43.030> right<00:05:47.520> ness<00:05:48.520> can

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
this is earthbound canon right ness can

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:56.790 
this is earthbound canon right ness can
fly<00:05:49.030> right

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.940 

yeah<00:05:57.800> pretty<00:05:58.100> sure<00:05:58.190> you<00:05:58.430> can<00:05:58.580> fly<00:05:59.230> and<00:06:00.230> that

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
yeah pretty sure you can fly and that

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.730 
yeah pretty sure you can fly and that
guy<00:06:01.160> can<00:06:01.430> too

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.999 

so<00:06:06.720> more<00:06:07.720> accurate<00:06:08.169> that<00:06:08.410> doesn't<00:06:08.740> make<00:06:08.830> any

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
so more accurate that doesn't make any

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.650 
so more accurate that doesn't make any
sense<00:06:09.130> how<00:06:09.490> does<00:06:09.639> that<00:06:09.729> fit<00:06:09.940> inside<00:06:10.120> there<00:06:10.449> but

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
sense how does that fit inside there but

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.430 
sense how does that fit inside there but
um<00:06:11.220> um<00:06:12.220> I<00:06:12.550> just<00:06:12.699> realized<00:06:13.210> he<00:06:13.330> walks<00:06:13.599> he<00:06:14.139> wiped

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
um um I just realized he walks he wiped

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.249 
um um I just realized he walks he wiped
sigh<00:06:14.889> sweat<00:06:15.460> off<00:06:15.699> his<00:06:15.729> before<00:06:16.720> him<00:06:16.900> anyway<00:06:17.319> um

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
sigh sweat off his before him anyway um

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.779 
sigh sweat off his before him anyway um
it<00:06:20.259> would<00:06:20.349> make<00:06:20.560> more<00:06:20.740> sense<00:06:20.800> it's<00:06:21.250> like<00:06:21.550> the
