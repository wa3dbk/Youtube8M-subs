flashbacks so it wasn't really was to

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.120 
flashbacks so it wasn't really was to
really<00:04:41.110> good<00:04:41.290> episodes<00:04:41.740> 0<00:04:41.920> because

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
really good episodes 0 because

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.800

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.870 
so it's definitely worth the watch you
should<00:04:50.560> definitely<00:04:50.740> go<00:04:50.950> watch<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.340> even<00:04:51.610> if<00:04:51.730> it

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
should definitely go watch it even if it

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.180 
should definitely go watch it even if it
is<00:04:52.680> recapping<00:04:53.680> all<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.950> things<00:04:54.100> we've

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
is recapping all the things we've

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.100 
is recapping all the things we've
already<00:04:54.430> seen<00:04:54.700> definitely<00:04:55.510> worth<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.990> watch

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
already seen definitely worth the watch

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.880 
already seen definitely worth the watch
go<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.560> watch<00:04:56.680> it<00:05:00.480> remember<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:02.020> basic<00:05:02.680> fab

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
go and watch it remember the basic fab

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.290 
go and watch it remember the basic fab
is<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.220> I'm<00:05:03.280> no<00:05:03.430> longer<00:05:03.490> standing<00:05:03.940> basic<00:05:04.180> lab

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
is that I'm no longer standing basic lab

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.210 
is that I'm no longer standing basic lab
I'm<00:05:04.450> just<00:05:04.660> putting<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.470> in<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.040> description

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
I'm just putting it in the description

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.610 
I'm just putting it in the description
below<00:05:06.730> ticular<00:05:07.690> in<00:05:07.810> description<00:05:08.200> below<00:05:08.230> using

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
below ticular in description below using

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.380 
below ticular in description below using
the<00:05:08.740> basic<00:05:08.860> clap<00:05:09.220> along<00:05:09.430> with<00:05:09.700> episode<00:05:10.120> rating

the basic clap along with episode rating

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.390 
the basic clap along with episode rating
I<00:05:10.600> figured<00:05:11.470> it's<00:05:11.620> just<00:05:11.800> easier<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:12.130> way<00:05:12.280> you

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
I figured it's just easier that way you

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.650 
I figured it's just easier that way you
know<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.580> can<00:05:12.760> read<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.060> instead<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.420> waiting

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
know you can read it instead of waiting

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.159 
know you can read it instead of waiting
as<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:13.960> go<00:05:14.230> one<00:05:14.500> by<00:05:14.770> one

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
as I go one by one

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.350 
as I go one by one
I<00:05:15.229> one<00:05:15.469> by<00:05:15.710> one<00:05:15.919> so<00:05:16.550> it's<00:05:17.360> easier<00:05:17.599> that<00:05:17.629> way<00:05:18.219> an

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
I one by one so it's easier that way an

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.670 
I one by one so it's easier that way an
