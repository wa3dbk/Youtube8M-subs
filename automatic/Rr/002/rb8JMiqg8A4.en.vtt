00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
here like that their defense played a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
thought coach adagio and staff did a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.169 
thought coach adagio and staff did a
nice<00:00:28.920> job<00:00:28.949> adjusting<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.060> was

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
nice job adjusting because it was

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
nice job adjusting because it was
completely<00:00:30.570> different<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> obvious

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
completely different the obvious

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.130 
completely different the obvious
concerns<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:33.030> three<00:00:33.300> times<00:00:33.570> i<00:00:33.750> believe<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
concerns are three times i believe it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.690 
concerns are three times i believe it
was<00:00:34.200> three<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.829> three<00:00:35.040> off<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> top
