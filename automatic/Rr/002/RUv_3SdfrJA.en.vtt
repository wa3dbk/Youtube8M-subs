take<00:00:25.560> away<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.920> third<00:00:26.189> vert<00:00:26.539> it<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
take away that third vert it really is a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.030 
take away that third vert it really is a
form<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.920> 3d<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.910> call<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.330> Tampa<00:00:30.720> -<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
form of 3d to call it a Tampa - this is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.459 
form of 3d to call it a Tampa - this is
a<00:00:32.070> misnomer<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.510> inside<00:00:33.930> back<00:00:34.200> or

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
a misnomer but it's that inside back or

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.959 
a misnomer but it's that inside back or
sometimes<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> guy<00:00:35.280> occasionally<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
sometimes this guy occasionally it's a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
sometimes this guy occasionally it's a
strong<00:00:36.270> side<00:00:36.510> linebacker<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.559> rate

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
strong side linebacker and it rate

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.819 
strong side linebacker and it rate
basically<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> becomes<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.790> 3d<00:00:39.149> defense<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.379> two

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
basically it becomes a 3d defense so two

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.850 
basically it becomes a 3d defense so two
deep<00:00:41.040> Tampa<00:00:41.879> -<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> genesis<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
deep Tampa - that's the genesis of it a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
deep Tampa - that's the genesis of it a
basic<00:00:44.489> 3d<00:00:45.059> coverage<00:00:47.390> which<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> other

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
basic 3d coverage which is the other

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.090 
basic 3d coverage which is the other
main<00:00:50.059> coverage<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> see<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.800> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
main coverage that you see is just that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
main coverage that you see is just that
you<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.670> three<00:00:54.030> people<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> eat<00:00:54.539> Corner

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you got three people to eat Corner

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.240 
you got three people to eat Corner
corner<00:00:55.230> free<00:00:55.590> safety

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
corner free safety

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.150 
corner free safety
strong<00:00:56.789> safety<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:58.050> backers<00:00:58.530> still<00:00:58.800> deploy

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
strong safety the backers still deploy

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.639 
strong safety the backers still deploy
the<00:00:59.340> same<00:00:59.609> way<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.300> again<00:01:00.719> let's<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the same way and again let's just do the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.119 
the same way and again let's just do the
numbers<00:01:01.800> deal<00:01:02.510> 3d<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:04.769> stronger

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
numbers deal 3d so now I'm much stronger

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.460 
numbers deal 3d so now I'm much stronger
deep<00:01:05.610> can't<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.330> many<00:01:06.510> people<00:01:06.960> vertical

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
deep can't get as many people vertical

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
deep can't get as many people vertical
because<00:01:07.619> I've<00:01:07.740> added<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> extra<00:01:08.340> guy<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.270> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
because I've added the extra guy but I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
because I've added the extra guy but I
only<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:09.840> finally<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.979> four<00:01:11.250> people

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
only have one finally have four people

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.240 
only have one finally have four people
underneath<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> strong

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
underneath so it's not a strong

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.789 
underneath so it's not a strong
underneath<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:16.170> something<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> get

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
underneath so you use something to get

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.300 
underneath so you use something to get
something

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
something

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
something
so<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.689> sorts<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so and then there's all sorts of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.350 
so and then there's all sorts of
variations<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> 3d<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> people<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.180> Rex

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
variations in the 3d and people and Rex

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690

that's<00:01:50.940> what<00:01:51.120> we're<00:01:51.240> stating<00:01:51.480> a<00:01:51.690> little<00:01:51.990> bit

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that's what we're stating a little bit

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
that's what we're stating a little bit
but<00:01:52.650> that'sthat's<00:01:53.220> his<00:01:53.310> basic<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:53.940> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
but that'sthat's his basic because it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
but that'sthat's his basic because it
gets<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:54.570> exactly<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.290> what

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
gets and that's exactly what what
