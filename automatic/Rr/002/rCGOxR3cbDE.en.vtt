g'day<00:00:09.780> I'm<00:00:09.960> Matt<00:00:10.380> Matt<00:00:10.670> one<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.820> things

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
g'day I'm Matt Matt one of the things

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.190 
g'day I'm Matt Matt one of the things
that's<00:00:12.210> really<00:00:12.360> important<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:12.900> us<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
that's really important for us to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.570 
that's really important for us to
understand<00:00:13.679> when<00:00:13.830> we're<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> trails

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
understand when we're out on the trails

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.730 
understand when we're out on the trails
it's<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.389> ground<00:00:15.719> clearance<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
it's a ground clearance it's the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.230 
it's a ground clearance it's the
clearance<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> vehicle<00:00:17.730> has<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.910> get

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
clearance that the vehicle has to get

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.560 
clearance that the vehicle has to get
over<00:00:18.390> obstacles<00:00:18.949> rocks<00:00:19.949> logs<00:00:20.580> things<00:00:21.359> like

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
over obstacles rocks logs things like

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.450 
over obstacles rocks logs things like
that<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> explore<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
that so we're going to explore that a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.730 
that so we're going to explore that a
bit<00:00:23.519> today<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> key<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.140> understanding

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
bit today so the key to understanding

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.429 
bit today so the key to understanding
the<00:00:26.519> ground<00:00:26.849> clearance<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.390> our<00:00:27.539> vehicles<00:00:27.990> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the ground clearance of our vehicles is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
the ground clearance of our vehicles is
knowing<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.099> where<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> parts<00:00:30.029> are<00:00:30.210> under

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
knowing what where the parts are under

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
knowing what where the parts are under
the<00:00:30.720> vehicle<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> lowest<00:00:31.679> part<00:00:31.859> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the vehicle that are the lowest part so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.130 
the vehicle that are the lowest part so
right<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.120> we've<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.510> differential

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
right here we've got the differential

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.319 
right here we've got the differential
that's<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.070> lowest<00:00:35.430> part<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.910> vehicle

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that's the lowest part of this vehicle

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
that's the lowest part of this vehicle
over<00:00:36.809> here<00:00:37.020> we've<00:00:37.140> got<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> control<00:00:37.649> arm<00:00:37.890> that's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
over here we've got a control arm that's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.880 
over here we've got a control arm that's
another<00:00:38.910> low<00:00:39.239> point<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.680> side

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
another low point and we on this side

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.000 
another low point and we on this side
we've<00:00:41.040> got<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.530> key<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
we've got one as well now the key to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
we've got one as well now the key to
getting<00:00:44.489> over<00:00:44.670> bigger<00:00:45.180> obstacles<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> right

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
getting over bigger obstacles is right

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
getting over bigger obstacles is right
here<00:00:46.320> between<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.129> control<00:00:47.550> arm<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
here between that control arm and the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.110 
here between that control arm and the
differential<00:00:49.020> over<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.559> that's<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.700> quite<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
differential over here that's a quite a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510 
differential over here that's a quite a
high<00:00:51.390> point<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:52.020> reasonable<00:00:52.530> width<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
high point that's reasonable width you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880 
high point that's reasonable width you
know<00:00:53.610> 700<00:00:54.239> millimetres<00:00:54.690> or<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.050> 70

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
know 700 millimetres or so 70

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
know 700 millimetres or so 70
centimetres<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.629> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
centimetres and I don't know what it is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.869 
centimetres and I don't know what it is
in<00:00:57.840> inches<00:00:58.199> okay<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.609> distance

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
in inches okay so that that distance

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.990 
in inches okay so that that distance
there<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.289> position<00:01:01.770> an<00:01:01.890> obstacle<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.850> go

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
there if we position an obstacle to go

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.450 
there if we position an obstacle to go
through<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.110> part<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> vehicle<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.309> can

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
through that part of the vehicle we can

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.250 
through that part of the vehicle we can
actually<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.909> over<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.420> without<00:01:06.780> really

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
actually get over it without really

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
actually get over it without really
damaging<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> vehicle<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:08.850> cool<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
damaging the vehicle how cool is that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.420 
damaging the vehicle how cool is that
but<00:01:09.689> let's<00:01:09.840> check<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.380> rock<00:01:10.560> over<00:01:10.890> here

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.300 

check<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.570> out<00:01:15.080> that's<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.620> decent<00:01:15.890> sized

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
check that out that's a decent sized

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.550 
check that out that's a decent sized
piece<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.880> rock<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.510> you<00:01:18.230> wouldn't<00:01:18.470> think

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
piece of rock and you wouldn't think

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.200 
piece of rock and you wouldn't think
that<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.220> vehicles<00:01:19.610> going<00:01:19.760> to<00:01:19.850> be<00:01:19.940> able<00:01:20.030> to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
that this vehicles going to be able to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.110 
that this vehicles going to be able to
get<00:01:20.360> over<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.810> but<00:01:21.530> trust<00:01:21.770> me<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.280> okay<00:01:23.060> so

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
get over it but trust me it is okay so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.640 
get over it but trust me it is okay so
we're<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:23.420> going<00:01:23.660> to<00:01:23.720> move<00:01:23.930> up<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.410> rock

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
we're just going to move up to this rock

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.610 
we're just going to move up to this rock
now<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.390> just<00:01:26.390> be<00:01:26.570> cut<00:01:26.780> by<00:01:26.930> positioning<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
now and just be cut by positioning the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.260 
now and just be cut by positioning the
vehicle<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.280> we<00:01:28.400> can<00:01:28.550> maximize<00:01:29.030> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
vehicle so that we can maximize the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.780 
vehicle so that we can maximize the
ground<00:01:29.750> clearance<00:01:30.250> we<00:01:31.250> actually<00:01:31.580> get<00:01:31.760> over

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
ground clearance we actually get over

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.780 
ground clearance we actually get over
the<00:01:32.090> top<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.479> rock<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.950> that's<00:01:34.520> what

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
the top of the rock and that that's what

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.070 
the top of the rock and that that's what
ground<00:01:35.060> clearance<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.690> all<00:01:35.840> about

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
ground clearance is all about

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.050 
ground clearance is all about
understanding<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.070> low<00:01:37.369> points<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:37.880> your

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
understanding the low points in your

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.330 
understanding the low points in your
vehicle<00:01:38.530> we've<00:01:39.530> had<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.740> look<00:01:39.920> under<00:01:40.220> our

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
vehicle we've had a look under our

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.859 
vehicle we've had a look under our
vehicle<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:41.000> understand<00:01:41.479> where<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> low

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
vehicle and we understand where the low

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.710 
vehicle and we understand where the low
points<00:01:42.320> are<00:01:42.470> where<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.800> high<00:01:42.950> points<00:01:43.369> are<00:01:43.720> but

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
points are where the high points are but

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.510 
points are where the high points are but
we<00:01:45.229> need<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.530> understand<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.040> when<00:01:46.280> we're<00:01:46.430> in

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
we need to understand that when we're in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.400 
we need to understand that when we're in
the<00:01:46.580> driving<00:01:46.850> seat<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.780> what<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:47.960> do<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.380> a

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
the driving seat so what I do is a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.440 
the driving seat so what I do is a
little<00:01:48.710> trick<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.160> have<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:49.970> look<00:01:50.119> under<00:01:50.420> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
little trick I have a look under the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.270 
little trick I have a look under the
vehicle<00:01:50.690> here<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.290> I<00:01:51.590> look<00:01:51.770> at<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.979> lowest

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
vehicle here and I look at the lowest

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.800 
vehicle here and I look at the lowest
points<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:52.729> that's<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.030> differential

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
points so that's the differential

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.990 
points so that's the differential
now<00:01:54.290> I'm<00:01:54.410> gonna<00:01:54.530> transpose<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.399> up<00:01:55.640> through

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
now I'm gonna transpose that up through

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.930 
now I'm gonna transpose that up through
the<00:01:56.149> bull<00:01:56.300> bar<00:01:56.979> up<00:01:57.979> through<00:01:58.310> here<00:01:58.520> through<00:01:58.820> the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
the bull bar up through here through the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.270 
the bull bar up through here through the
spotlights<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.720> down<00:02:00.500> through<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.890> bonnet

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
spotlights and down through the bonnet

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.109 
spotlights and down through the bonnet
to<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.149> driving<00:02:02.450> position<00:02:02.800> now<00:02:03.800> if<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.820> take<00:02:05.060> a

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
to the driving position now if I take a

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.600 
to the driving position now if I take a
mark<00:02:05.450> here<00:02:05.780> on<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.020> bonnet<00:02:06.229> which<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.490> to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
mark here on the bonnet which is just to

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.930 
mark here on the bonnet which is just to
the<00:02:07.640> left<00:02:07.729> of<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.720> washer<00:02:09.790> outlet<00:02:10.790> up

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
the left of that the washer outlet up

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.090 
the left of that the washer outlet up
there<00:02:11.180> we're<00:02:11.900> not<00:02:12.020> go<00:02:12.170> into<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.500> vehicle<00:02:12.890> I'll

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
there we're not go into the vehicle I'll

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.920 
there we're not go into the vehicle I'll
be<00:02:13.340> able<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.550> pick<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.820> point<00:02:14.090> on<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.360> dashboard

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
be able to pick a point on the dashboard

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.440 
be able to pick a point on the dashboard
that<00:02:15.500> tells<00:02:15.830> me<00:02:16.100> where<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.730> front<00:02:17.000> dis<00:02:17.239> is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
that tells me where the front dis is

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.600 
that tells me where the front dis is
okay<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.320> we've<00:02:18.650> drawn<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> line<00:02:19.250> from<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
okay so we've drawn a line from the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.880 
okay so we've drawn a line from the
front<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.060> car<00:02:20.269> up<00:02:20.690> through<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.620> vehicle

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
front of the car up through the vehicle

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.710 
front of the car up through the vehicle
now<00:02:22.160> that's<00:02:22.670> coming<00:02:22.880> through<00:02:23.269> this<00:02:23.390> part<00:02:23.660> of

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
now that's coming through this part of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.030 
now that's coming through this part of
the<00:02:23.810> steering<00:02:24.170> wheel<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.769> what<00:02:24.920> does<00:02:25.010> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
the steering wheel so what does that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.949 
the steering wheel so what does that
mean<00:02:25.310> when<00:02:25.760> am<00:02:25.880> I'm<00:02:26.150> out<00:02:26.420> on<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> trails

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
mean when am I'm out on the trails

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.990 
mean when am I'm out on the trails
basically<00:02:27.500> my<00:02:27.620> differentials<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.519> know<00:02:28.640> that

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
basically my differentials I know that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.490 
basically my differentials I know that
they're<00:02:29.120> basically<00:02:29.540> going<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.870> be<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.170> part

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
they're basically going to be this part

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
they're basically going to be this part
of<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.680> vehicle<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:31.489> where<00:02:31.670> when<00:02:32.060> I'm<00:02:32.180> looking

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
of the vehicle so where when I'm looking

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.900 
of the vehicle so where when I'm looking
at<00:02:32.780> an<00:02:32.900> obstacle<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.470> front<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.769> me<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.130> can<00:02:34.670> just

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
at an obstacle in front of me I can just

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.449 
at an obstacle in front of me I can just
line<00:02:35.299> that<00:02:35.660> up<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.769> left<00:02:36.980> or<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.370> right

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
line that up to the left or to the right

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.470 
line that up to the left or to the right
as<00:02:37.850> need<00:02:38.150> be<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.440> obstacle<00:02:40.480> fantastic

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
as need be to that obstacle fantastic

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.840 
as need be to that obstacle fantastic
now<00:02:41.810> calls<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.160> hopefully<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.730> can

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
now calls that so hopefully you can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.759 
now calls that so hopefully you can
understand<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.540> under<00:02:44.959> vehicle<00:02:45.110> clearance

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
understand that under vehicle clearance

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.160 
understand that under vehicle clearance
now<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.670> important<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.239> know<00:02:47.420> because

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
now is really important to know because

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.840 
now is really important to know because
then<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.650> allows<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.310> get<00:02:49.459> over<00:02:49.670> the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
then it allows you to get over the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.870 
then it allows you to get over the
obstacles<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.320> he<00:02:52.070> got<00:02:52.280> over<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.670> big

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
obstacles so that he got over the big

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.229 
obstacles so that he got over the big
head<00:02:53.709> that's<00:02:54.709> really<00:02:55.160> important<00:02:55.700> there's<00:02:56.120> a

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
head that's really important there's a

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.030 
head that's really important there's a
low<00:02:56.450> point<00:02:56.750> there's<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.200> low<00:02:57.350> point<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.829> death

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
low point there's a low point of death

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.670 
low point there's a low point of death
but<00:02:58.579> overall<00:02:58.940> he<00:02:59.450> can<00:02:59.600> get<00:02:59.720> over<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.140> obstacle

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
but overall he can get over the obstacle

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.590 
but overall he can get over the obstacle
how<00:03:00.980> good<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.489> we've<00:03:02.060> got<00:03:02.239> some<00:03:02.390> other<00:03:02.540> great
