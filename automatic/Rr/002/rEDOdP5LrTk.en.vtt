00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.979 
hits the fan his blood was all over the
room<00:02:37.739> basically<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:41.360> she's<00:02:42.360> gonna<00:02:42.480> suss<00:02:42.840> out

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
room basically and she's gonna suss out

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.720 
room basically and she's gonna suss out
the<00:02:43.049> area<00:02:43.470> see<00:02:43.709> what's<00:02:43.920> where<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.459> if<00:02:44.579> I

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the area see what's where and if I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.970 
the area see what's where and if I
missing<00:02:45.030> anything<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:46.769> we're<00:02:46.890> gonna

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
missing anything and so if we're gonna

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.229 
missing anything and so if we're gonna
have<00:02:47.099> splice<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.430> coming<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.090> any

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
have splice is coming out this way any

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.370 
have splice is coming out this way any
but<00:02:48.420> that's<00:02:48.569> for<00:02:48.720> sure<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:51.660> event<00:02:52.049> I'll

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
but that's for sure this event I'll

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.690 
but that's for sure this event I'll
probably<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.950> get<00:02:53.099> it<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.640> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
probably have to get it to that in a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.030 
probably have to get it to that in a
minute<00:02:54.110> another<00:02:55.110> door<00:02:55.319> no<00:02:55.620> doubt<00:02:55.799> another

minute another door no doubt another

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160 
minute another door no doubt another
entry<00:02:56.370> point<00:02:56.549> for<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> splicers<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.959> we<00:02:58.079> know

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
entry point for the splicers so we know

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.000 
entry point for the splicers so we know
they're<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.530> coming<00:02:58.590> from<00:02:58.739> at<00:02:58.920> least
