00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
foot sometimes it's really weird and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.830 
foot sometimes it's really weird and
because<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.000> don't<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.179> any<00:00:09.330> one<00:00:09.510> kind<00:00:09.780> of

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
because I don't have any one kind of

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.919 
because I don't have any one kind of
looking<00:00:10.230> after<00:00:10.620> me<00:00:10.910> to<00:00:11.910> go<00:00:12.059> knock<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.750> door

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
looking after me to go knock on the door

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.600 
looking after me to go knock on the door
and<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.170> always<00:00:13.469> think<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.980> I've<00:00:14.250> done<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
and I always think is that I've done it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.120 
and I always think is that I've done it
before<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> big<00:00:15.360> moment<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
before it's like a big moment so and and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.800 
before it's like a big moment so and and
I<00:00:17.220> don't<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.490> myself<00:00:18.119> right<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.570> really

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I don't think myself right and it really

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.920 
I don't think myself right and it really
yeah<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.920> kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:21.180> makes<00:00:21.240> me<00:00:21.600> feel<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> bit

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
yeah it kind of it makes me feel a bit

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.630 
yeah it kind of it makes me feel a bit
weird<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.920> thought<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
weird and I thought this is not the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.910 
weird and I thought this is not the
really<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> time<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.170> shall<00:00:25.439> get

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
really the time to do it but I shall get

because the band felt if it was our show
it<00:01:29.700> would<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.329> work<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.680> wasn't<00:01:31.860> our

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it would it would work but it wasn't our
