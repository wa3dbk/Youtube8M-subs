people I wouldn't be into art as a

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.949 
people I wouldn't be into art as a
person<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.519> would<00:02:23.390> die<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.530> wasn't<00:02:24.860> ok<00:02:25.959> yeah

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
person I would die if it wasn't ok yeah

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.430 
person I would die if it wasn't ok yeah
I<00:02:26.989> think<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.440> because<00:02:27.880> artists<00:02:28.880> chat<00:02:29.209> into

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
I think it is because artists chat into

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.030 
I think it is because artists chat into
those<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:31.610> order<00:02:31.910> all<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.120> consciousness<00:02:32.750> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
those in order all the consciousness and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.730 
those in order all the consciousness and
people<00:02:34.040> what<00:02:34.250> people<00:02:34.400> feel<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:36.020> think<00:02:36.440> you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
people what people feel and I think you

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.840 
people what people feel and I think you
know<00:02:36.770> their<00:02:37.100> own<00:02:37.540> niche<00:02:38.540> things<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
know their own niche things and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.950 
know their own niche things and
expressions<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.060> themselves<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
expressions of themselves the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.020 
expressions of themselves the
percentages<00:02:42.530> because<00:02:43.460> an<00:02:43.550> expression<00:02:43.970> of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
percentages because an expression of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.240 
percentages because an expression of
one's<00:02:44.210> personality<00:02:44.920> there's<00:02:45.920> no<00:02:46.100> music

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
why is art important for human slightly

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.580 
why is art important for human slightly
well<00:03:05.330> since<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.630> basic<00:03:05.990> beginning<00:03:06.500> of

humanity the basic Neanderthals have

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.660 
humanity the basic Neanderthals have
always<00:03:09.080> drawn<00:03:09.290> on<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> walls<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.460> stuff

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
always drawn on the walls and the stuff

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.790 
always drawn on the walls and the stuff
they<00:03:10.820> originally<00:03:11.150> drew<00:03:11.360> was<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:12.140> them<00:03:12.380> hunting

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
they originally drew was of them hunting

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.700 
they originally drew was of them hunting
and<00:03:13.240> even<00:03:14.240> of<00:03:14.330> their<00:03:14.480> death<00:03:14.720> rituals<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.380> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
people that were going to die they

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.030 
people that were going to die they
weren't<00:03:17.210> very<00:03:17.470> very<00:03:18.470> good<00:03:18.620> at<00:03:18.710> drawing<00:03:18.890> but

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
weren't very very good at drawing but

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.560 
weren't very very good at drawing but
still<00:03:19.340> there<00:03:19.490> was<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.640> was<00:03:19.910> inherent<00:03:20.420> within

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
still there was it was inherent within

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.570 
still there was it was inherent within
human<00:03:20.870> nature<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.140> draw<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.160> creative

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
human nature to draw and the creative

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.040 
human nature to draw and the creative
element<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.940> drawing<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.330> as<00:03:23.570> much<00:03:23.780> as<00:03:23.930> like

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
element of drawing is as much as like

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.570 
element of drawing is as much as like
learning<00:03:24.260> how<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.470> use<00:03:24.620> fire<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.160> use<00:03:25.250> tools

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
learning how to use fire and use tools

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.070 
learning how to use fire and use tools

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.400 
20th century and now in the 21st is
changing<00:03:40.460> even<00:03:40.610> more<00:03:40.910> but<00:03:41.900> before<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.350> it

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
changing even more but before that it

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.510 
changing even more but before that it
was<00:03:42.530> all<00:03:42.680> about<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:42.950> know<00:03:43.010> capturing<00:03:43.460> the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
was all about you know capturing the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.590 
was all about you know capturing the
image<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.760> all<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:43.970> all<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.210> way<00:03:44.300> long<00:03:44.450> it's

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
image and all that all the way long it's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.240 
image and all that all the way long it's
always<00:03:44.840> been<00:03:44.990> capturing<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:45.920> image<00:03:46.130> of

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
always been capturing the image of

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.070 
always been capturing the image of
something<00:03:46.490> until<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.270> got<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.510> camera<00:03:47.870> and

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
something until we got the camera and

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.170 
something until we got the camera and
we've<00:03:48.440> got<00:03:48.770> digital<00:03:49.400> cameras<00:03:49.790> now<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.120> all

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
we've got digital cameras now and all

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.760 
we've got digital cameras now and all
that<00:03:50.300> kind<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.510> stuff<00:03:50.570> so<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> art<00:03:51.500> is<00:03:51.590> still

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
that kind of stuff so I art is still

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.490 
that kind of stuff so I art is still
very<00:03:52.010> relevant<00:03:52.580> in<00:03:53.090> society<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:54.140> it's<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.350> big

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
very relevant in society and it's a big

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.470 
very relevant in society and it's a big
it's<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.370> think<00:03:55.550> as<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> slight<00:03:55.970> lead<00:03:56.060> over<00:03:56.300> there

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
it's I think as a slight lead over there

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.590 
it's I think as a slight lead over there
should<00:03:56.690> be<00:03:57.040> something<00:03:58.040> like<00:03:58.480> Staten<00:03:59.480> US

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
should be something like Staten US

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.970 
should be something like Staten US
Russia<00:03:59.780> or<00:04:00.080> somewhere<00:04:00.380> where<00:04:00.530> free

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
Russia or somewhere where free

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.790 
Russia or somewhere where free
expression<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.490> in<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:01.610> louder
