00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.820
 daniel has reached the top of his career as 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.830
 executive of a multinational has 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 the level you always wanted 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.400
 and when he got there he discovered that it was not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380
 that's what I wanted 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.439
 after 20 years in the administrative area 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.380
 a good salary and stability 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.390
 dropped everything to start over from this 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 doing what you like 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.820
 I wanted to be an entrepreneur and own the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.010
 own business but first had to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.309
 find the course of action 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.110
 the idea came from the Julian woman a micro 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.180
 craft brewery 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.120
 the company was opened in February 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 investment of 500 thousand reais that should 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.039
 It takes three years to make profit 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.230
 production is 2 thousand liters per month 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 I'm looking for a couple that puts their hand on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.399
 mass or better political the process is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 Late 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.410
 are 12 hours of work for the production 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.899
 initial and one month to await 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.700
 beer result is pleasurable 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.560
 especially for those who like to drink 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.590
 beer see the result of both 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 Work is great , then you 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.460
 share this result with your friends 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.520
 with your customers with everything then 12 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 hours of hard work 30 days of 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 suffering for you expected the result 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 the beer but in the end the result 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.220
 make up for everything but make mistakes 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.560
 that to be enterprising enough to have 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.869
 money and a good idea three years ago 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.150
 that Daniel decided to create a micro 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.180
 brewery since then comes 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.890
 studying courses and workshops 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.720
 he even became a sommelier of 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.850
 taster for manufacturers such as 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.880
 executive worked on average 10 hours 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.310
 per day as a brewer works more than 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.710
 What is this and even on the weekends? 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.970
 something that is worth it to him when 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.470
 do what you like 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.509
 The woman is holding the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.759
 household expenses for the time being 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.390
 brewery will begin to return to 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.610
 then it will also change daily 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.439
 definitely the idea is in the future I 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.210
 I do not know how long this future is going to be 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.030
 It will be one year from now. 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.520
 years but really the desire is to leave the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.530
 Stress is not to have paulo ever 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.690
 more than in the marginal tietÃª or in the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.770
 marginal pine at the time of the ranch 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.470
 this idea 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.170
 the business is still in its infancy to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.840
 word of mouth until the end of the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.250
 daniel intends to expand production and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.370
 hire employees 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.570
 while perfecting art of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.880
 to drink beer 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.900
 The important thing is that you are happy with the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.370
 Choice you made 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.070
 I think that's what I was looking for in 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 my life take pleasure in what to do 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.090
 I think the other day I heard a phrase that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.650
 I was saying the following when you do what? 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.480
 You're never going to work in the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.630
 And I think I came to this. 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.630
 Score
