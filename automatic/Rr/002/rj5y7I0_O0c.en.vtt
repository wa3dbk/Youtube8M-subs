alright<00:00:04.880> so<00:00:05.300> the<00:00:05.630> conversion<00:00:06.319> is<00:00:06.500> finally

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
alright so the conversion is finally

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.490 
alright so the conversion is finally
here<00:00:07.269> be<00:00:08.269> thrown<00:00:08.540> in<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:08.809> 2.4<00:00:09.440> gigahertz

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
here be thrown in the 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.960 
here be thrown in the 2.4 gigahertz
brushless<00:00:10.370> system<00:00:10.760> into<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:11.720> micro<00:00:12.110> rally<00:00:12.970> so

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
brushless system into the micro rally so

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.099 
brushless system into the micro rally so
you<00:00:14.030> have<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:14.300> out<00:00:14.390> the<00:00:14.510> contents<00:00:15.050> of<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.350> box

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
you have the out the contents of the box

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.420 
you have the out the contents of the box
instruction<00:00:18.109> manuals<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.130> side

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
instruction manuals so that the side

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.540 
instruction manuals so that the side
that's<00:00:19.609> why<00:00:19.789> we're<00:00:19.910> watching<00:00:20.240> this<00:00:20.329> video

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.390 

alright<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:25.970> get<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:26.989> body<00:00:27.230> off

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.280 

then<00:00:31.270> we're<00:00:31.570> gonna<00:00:31.660> have<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:31.930> do<00:00:32.050> something

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
then we're gonna have to do something

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.740 
then we're gonna have to do something
about<00:00:32.410> those<00:00:32.970> body<00:00:33.970> pins<00:00:34.300> it's<00:00:34.540> almost

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
about those body pins it's almost

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.920 
about those body pins it's almost
impossible<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:36.610> off<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:38.890> right<00:00:39.129> so<00:00:39.930> you

is getting the power switch out little
break<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.229> little<00:01:23.890> tabs<00:01:24.100> you're<00:01:24.400> going<00:01:24.520> to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
break in the little tabs you're going to

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.910 
break in the little tabs you're going to
need<00:01:24.670> that<00:01:24.820> for<00:01:24.939> the<00:01:25.000> next<00:01:25.030> guy<00:01:25.619> alright<00:01:26.619> so

need that for the next guy alright so
motor<00:01:27.280> mount<00:01:27.520> we've<00:01:27.820> got<00:01:27.939> three<00:01:28.210> screws<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
motor mount we've got three screws and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.200 
motor mount we've got three screws and
then<00:01:31.509> beside<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.110> we<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.530> another<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:32.920> guess

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
then beside that we have another I guess

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.140 
then beside that we have another I guess
plastic<00:01:34.210> bracer<00:01:35.080> plate<00:01:36.010> up<00:01:36.160> top<00:01:36.400> two<00:01:36.910> screws

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
plastic bracer plate up top two screws

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.870 
plastic bracer plate up top two screws
to<00:01:37.330> get<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.570> out<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.080> motor<00:01:38.260> falls<00:01:38.530> out

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
to get that out and the motor falls out

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.990 
to get that out and the motor falls out
the<00:01:39.880> motor<00:01:40.090> mount<00:01:40.360> off<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.830> we<00:01:42.670> start<00:01:42.910> with

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
the motor mount off and we start with

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.250 
the motor mount off and we start with
the<00:01:43.030> bills<00:01:43.240> so<00:01:43.510> now<00:01:43.720> I'm<00:01:43.780> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.960> put<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
the bills so now I'm going to put the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.160 
the bills so now I'm going to put the
brushless<00:01:44.800> motor<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.720> might<00:01:49.870> take<00:01:50.050> an

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
brushless motor in so you might take an

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.780 
brushless motor in so you might take an
apartment<00:01:50.620> put<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.920> three<00:01:51.250> motor<00:01:51.520> mounts

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
apartment put the three motor mounts

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.790 
apartment put the three motor mounts
cruise<00:01:52.000> in<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:56.140> then<00:01:56.409> we're<00:01:56.500> going<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.650> go

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
cruise in and then we're going to go

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.660 
cruise in and then we're going to go
ahead<00:01:56.830> with<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> plastic<00:01:57.940> brace

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969 

and<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> motor<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.560> set<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and for the motor what I do to set the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.120 
and for the motor what I do to set the
is<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.630> mesh<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.530> piece<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.739> paper<00:02:10.890> in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
is the the mesh is the piece of paper in

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.890 
is the the mesh is the piece of paper in
between<00:02:11.220> both<00:02:11.550> keep<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> good<00:02:12.360> tension<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:12.870> it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
between both keep a good tension on it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.690 
between both keep a good tension on it
and<00:02:13.200> that's<00:02:13.349> about<00:02:13.800> right<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.250> never<00:02:14.340> had<00:02:14.520> any

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and that's about right and never had any

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.010 
and that's about right and never had any
issues<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:18.480> right<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.870> we're

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
issues with that all right so we're

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.600 
issues with that all right so we're
going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.200> put<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.500> brush<00:02:19.770> just<00:02:19.980> 2.4

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
going to put the brush just 2.4

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.510 
going to put the brush just 2.4
gigahertz<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.410> there<00:02:22.560> or<00:02:23.100> combo

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
gigahertz you see in there or combo

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.540 
gigahertz you see in there or combo
whatever<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.880> want<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.060> call<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:26.400> like

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
whatever you want to call it just like

whatever you want to call it just like
taking<00:02:26.850> apart<00:02:27.090> we're<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> add<00:02:27.630> back<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
taking apart we're going to add back the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.930 
taking apart we're going to add back the
four<00:02:29.040> screws<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.160> I'm<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.280> up<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> try<00:02:32.880> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
four screws so I'm going up to try to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.460 
four screws so I'm going up to try to
route<00:02:33.150> those<00:02:33.300> power<00:02:33.540> wire<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:33.989> pretty<00:02:34.200> tight

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
route those power wire it's pretty tight
