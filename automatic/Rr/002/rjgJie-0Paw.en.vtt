00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.660
-After a long winter enjoying hearty chilli
or stew recipes, this spring vegetable soup

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.110
is a welcome change.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.309
The soup is quick to make.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.580
The secret is to do all the chopping and mincing
before you start cooking.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.380
Just place each ingredient in a separate bowl
as you go along.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.380
Let's get started.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.610
First, chop 1 large onion.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:36.620
You'll need 1 cup.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.559
Then chop enough fennel to make half a cup.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.460
Mince 3 cloves of garlic.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.149
Trim 1-1/2 pounds of fresh asparagus spears
then cut them into 1-inch pieces.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.569
You should have about 4 cups.

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:02.120
Next, cut 2 medium zucchini in half lengthwise
the cut them into quarter-inch slices.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.879
You'll need 2-1/2 cups.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.050
And now, chop 3 Roma tomatoes or enough to
make 1 cup.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.909
Finely chop 2 tablespoons of fresh basil.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.320
All of the ingredients are ready.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.340
It's time to cook.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.540
Over medium high heat, add 2 tablespoons of
olive oil to a 4-quart Dutch oven.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:33.470
Once the oil is hot, add the onion, the fennel,
and the garlic.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.290
Cook and stir until the onions begin to brown
or caramelize.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.430
This will take 8 to 10 minutes.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.820
Browning the vegetables so they begin to caramelize
makes the broth sweeter and richer tasting

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.270
so you get a satisfying soup.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:56.070
Stir in three 14-1/2 ounce cans of vegetable
broth or chicken broth 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.289
and bring the soup to a boil.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.840
Reduce the heat to medium low, cover the Dutch
oven, and simmer the soup for 5 minutes.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:25.349
Next, stir in the asparagus, the zucchini,
and the tomatoes.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.560
Return the soup to a boil then reduce the
heat to medium low again and replace the cover.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.569
Simmer the soup until the zucchini is just
tender.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.599
This will take about 5 minutes.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.030
Season the soup with a half teaspoon of salt,
a quarter teaspoon of black pepper, and the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:51.720
chopped basil.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.180
For a flavorful finishing touch, sprinkle
each bowl of spring vegetable soup with a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.950
little grated parmesan cheese and fresh basil
on top.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.920
Pretty as a picture.
