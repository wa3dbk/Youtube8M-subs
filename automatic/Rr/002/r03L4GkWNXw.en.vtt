00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
also bulldoze it and replace it with a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.550 
also bulldoze it and replace it with a

coal power plan is a better option for

me since it's a lot cheaper although
it's<00:02:24.380> dirty<00:02:24.650> it'll<00:02:25.459> take<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.610> long<00:02:25.820> time<00:02:26.090> for
