00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it actually reads when we hook it up to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.749 
it actually reads when we hook it up to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the amp meter so let me flip this all

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.200 
the amp meter so let me flip this all
the<00:01:35.850> way<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> we're<00:01:38.369> gonna<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.909> down

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the way up and we're gonna put this down

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.859 
the way up and we're gonna put this down
select<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:40.110> DC<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:45.539> it's<00:01:45.630> rounded

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
select it to DC you see so it's rounded

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.199 
select it to DC you see so it's rounded
DC<00:01:46.259> I'm<00:01:46.560> gonna<00:01:46.770> zero<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:52.459> well<00:01:53.459> it<00:01:54.030> didn't

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
DC I'm gonna zero it out well it didn't

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.109 
DC I'm gonna zero it out well it didn't
zero<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.929> not<00:01:54.990> zeroing<00:01:55.530> out<00:01:55.679> either<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.579> so

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
zero it's not zeroing out either way so

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.679 
zero it's not zeroing out either way so
I'm<00:01:57.179> gonna<00:01:57.299> put<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.289> max<00:01:59.539> we're<00:02:00.539> gonna

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
I'm gonna put this on max we're gonna

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.999 
I'm gonna put this on max we're gonna
need<00:02:00.780> max<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.349> it's<00:02:01.439> gonna<00:02:01.530> show<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.799> two

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
need max and it's gonna show you two
