00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
me in the old game because the offense

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
me in the old game because the offense
was<00:01:37.290> different<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.610> San<00:01:38.850> Antonio<00:01:39.030> Spurs

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
was different but the San Antonio Spurs

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.179 
was different but the San Antonio Spurs
are<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.170> greatest<00:01:40.409> team<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.680> adjustment

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
are the greatest team in adjustment

shack<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:42.150> will<00:01:42.420> adjust<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
shack and they will adjust and now it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.880 
shack and they will adjust and now it
will<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.880> Oklahoma<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.439> handle<00:01:46.770> that
