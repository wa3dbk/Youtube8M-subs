00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 AndrÃ© from my modest homecenter 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.390
 teaches how to choose a charcoal grill 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.400
 the charcoal grill is the classic 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.770
 chin a roast by klaus now 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.170
 smoked the unmistakable meat and because 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.200
 for many there is no roast if there is no 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.670
 ritual of setting the fire to choose 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.260
 the most appropriate the first thing that you have to 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.570
 keep in mind is the space that 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.150
 we have and how many people are going to 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.509
 participate because there are grills of all 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.509
 the sizes 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.699
 for example the medium grills 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.530
 drum are very plastic and not only 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.079
 they have the grid for sharp you will have 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.090
 built-in side trays sheaves 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.160
 to raise or lower the meat even 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.089
 other accessories such as caps for 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.100
 keep the heat and if on the lid the 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.629
 chin has a smoker with indicator 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.000
 of temperature can be made 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.000
 different and very tasty preparations 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.140
 there are grills that bring a second area 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.750
 of cooking this allows to have more 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 space to grill or just keep 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.850
 the food there are even some that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.700
 they have a motorized trench so that the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.830
 second grid can spin these 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.030
 sword grids for roasting 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.710
 Slow and rotating meat ventilation 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.140
 It is also important to regulate the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.270
 temperature for example this grill 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.640
 in addition to the ventilation has tray 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.110
 ash collector and a deposit 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.360
 for coal another important factor is 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.119
 define if you need a grill with 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.110
 wheels this helps to move it over 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.270
 all when 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.360
 a defined place for roasts or for 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.550

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.930
