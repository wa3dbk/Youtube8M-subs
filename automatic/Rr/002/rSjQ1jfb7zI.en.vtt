00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
notice how easily it is for the writer

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120 
notice how easily it is for the writer
to<00:01:42.360> switch<00:01:42.570> gears<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.110> easily<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.770> back<00:01:43.950> into

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to switch gears and easily get back into

position

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.610 

seemed<00:01:59.850> very<00:02:00.030> comfortable<00:02:00.300> able<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> climb

seemed very comfortable able to climb
with<00:02:01.680> very<00:02:02.190> easy<00:02:03.260> actually<00:02:04.260> easier<00:02:04.920> than

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
with very easy actually easier than

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:14.840 
with very easy actually easier than
standard<00:02:05.640> handlebars<00:02:12.920> having<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.040> control<00:02:14.460> out

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
standard handlebars having a control out

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.450 
standard handlebars having a control out
here<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.360> amazed<00:02:15.720> at<00:02:16.050> having<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:17.010> hands

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
here I was amazed at having my hands

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.050 
here I was amazed at having my hands
here<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.270> how<00:02:18.810> much<00:02:19.020> control<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.680> had

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
here and here how much control I had

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.540 
here and here how much control I had
versus<00:02:21.320> here<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.470> felt<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.980> even<00:02:23.070> had<00:02:23.310> more

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
versus here it felt like I even had more

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.220 
versus here it felt like I even had more
control<00:02:23.670> than<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.180> was<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.600> real<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.200> real

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
control than I was on the real the real

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.430 
control than I was on the real the real
bars<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.820> course<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.810> advantage<00:02:28.290> of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
bars and of course the advantage of

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.080 
bars and of course the advantage of
being<00:02:28.500> able<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.040> extend<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.550> little<00:02:29.670> bit<00:02:29.880> more

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
being able to extend a little bit more

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.540 
being able to extend a little bit more
out<00:02:30.380> like<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.680> still<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.310> control

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
out like this and still have control

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.310 
out like this and still have control
what<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.090> can't<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.660> know<00:02:33.780> can't<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:34.170> because

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
what you can't you know can't do because

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.110 
what you can't you know can't do because
you're<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.770> compressed<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.580> regular<00:02:35.850> bars

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
you're so compressed on the regular bars

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.250 
you're so compressed on the regular bars
that<00:02:37.460> improves<00:02:38.460> stability<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.750> safety

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that improves stability and I safety

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.540 
that improves stability and I safety
obviously<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.070> you're<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:41.430> you're

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
obviously when you're when you're

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.240 
obviously when you're when you're
writing<00:02:41.850> because<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.750> think<00:02:43.020> overall<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:44.100> a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
writing because I think overall it's a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.630 
writing because I think overall it's a
excellent<00:02:45.180> idea<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.830> very<00:02:46.830> light<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.400> for

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
excellent idea and very light so for

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.600 
excellent idea and very light so for
weight<00:02:47.790> weenies<00:02:48.210> like<00:02:48.450> me<00:02:49.220> you're<00:02:50.220> not<00:02:50.370> adding

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
weight weenies like me you're not adding

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.240 
weight weenies like me you're not adding
hardly<00:02:51.060> any<00:02:51.210> grams<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.860> weight<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
hardly any grams to the weight of the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.720 
hardly any grams to the weight of the
bike<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.760> yet<00:02:54.540> benefiting<00:02:55.260> from<00:02:55.550> all<00:02:56.550> the
