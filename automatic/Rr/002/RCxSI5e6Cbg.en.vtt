00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:08.470 

hopefully<00:00:05.809> the<00:00:06.580> believe<00:00:07.580> the<00:00:07.609> video<00:00:07.819> is<00:00:08.000> on<00:00:08.240> I

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
hopefully the believe the video is on I

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.049 
hopefully the believe the video is on I
realized<00:00:08.930> I<00:00:09.049> hadn't<00:00:09.320> made<00:00:09.709> a<00:00:09.769> video<00:00:09.950> in<00:00:10.129> over<00:00:11.030> a

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
realized I hadn't made a video in over a

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.359 
realized I hadn't made a video in over a
year<00:00:11.150> with<00:00:12.019> any<00:00:12.200> other<00:00:12.410> reptile<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.070> I<00:00:13.129> figured

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
year with any other reptile so I figured

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.369 
year with any other reptile so I figured
I'd<00:00:13.459> bring<00:00:13.670> this<00:00:13.820> girl<00:00:14.000> out<00:00:14.270> and<00:00:14.480> chill<00:00:15.230> her

that<00:01:51.800> I<00:01:51.830> have<00:01:52.010> is<00:01:52.130> about<00:01:52.460> half<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.760> weight<00:01:53.090> and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
that I have is about half the weight and

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.210 
that I have is about half the weight and
I<00:01:55.100> think<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.320> think<00:01:57.320> she's<00:01:57.710> big<00:01:57.890> enough<00:01:57.920> to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.830 
I think I think she's big enough to
breed<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:58.610> year<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.000> think<00:01:59.450> he's<00:01:59.600> big<00:01:59.810> enough

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.440 
the dry desert areas there's two species
of<00:02:48.640> Madagascar<00:02:49.210> tree<00:02:49.510> boa<00:02:49.750> one<00:02:50.650> from<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.450> rain

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
of Madagascar tree boa one from the rain

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.930 
of Madagascar tree boa one from the rain
forest<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.840> one<00:02:52.990> from<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> drier<00:02:53.440> areas<00:02:59.940> and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
forest and one from the drier areas and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.750 
forest and one from the drier areas and
so<00:03:02.400> four<00:03:03.400> species<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.360> Boas<00:03:04.660> from<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.200> area

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
so four species of Boas from that area

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.250 
so four species of Boas from that area
yeah<00:03:07.260> come<00:03:08.260> on<00:03:08.320> smile<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:08.980> camera<00:03:10.260> you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
your typical do Murrells this is

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:38.680 
your typical do Murrells this is
definitely<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.650> heaviest<00:03:29.890> snake<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.610> have

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
temperatures standard boa meals except

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.130 
temperatures standard boa meals except
to<00:03:49.850> get<00:03:50.000> they<00:03:50.660> grow<00:03:50.960> they<00:03:51.680> grow<00:03:51.800> super<00:03:52.100> fast

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
to get they grow they grow super fast
