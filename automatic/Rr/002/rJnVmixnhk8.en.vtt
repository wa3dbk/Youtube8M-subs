that<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.200> character<00:01:55.530> creation<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.009> pretty

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
that the character creation is pretty

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.190 
that the character creation is pretty
unique<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.729> game<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.719> currently
