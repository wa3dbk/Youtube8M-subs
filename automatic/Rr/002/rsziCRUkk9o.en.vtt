00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:04.199
 of all 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.260
 angola very good to all and welcome 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.940

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.680

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.170
 twitter and on facebook for my accounts 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.700
 that appear here below good as 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.949
 Every Tuesday night I love you 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.440
 recommend an application of ios that goes 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.730
 to be for me the app of the week no no 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.500
 it has to be a new application to 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.060
 sometimes it will be sometimes not but the truth 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.190
 is that this application I use it 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.439
 practically every day and that less than 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.719
 recommended to all of you is a 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.420
 fitz reader is this down here to 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.070
 the left is called news ifai is a 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.079
 application that is universal that has a 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.370
 price of 89 cents is paid 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.629
 but it has a version that is 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.089
 completely free is completely 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.679
 free that adds advertising and has 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.510
 some disadvantages because we are not going to 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.280
 can share with pocket for example 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.929
 which for me is something essential not 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.460
 let's get into this application to 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.319
 see a little the review to see that the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.569
 interface is very clean it looks pretty 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.639
 well we are going to put for example in the 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.649
 geek coffee feed that is a blog 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.180
 I also like to read and notice 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.830
 that from here we will see all the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.540
 articles that I have to read 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.920
 do not notice that we 're going to get into the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.049
 first it already had read 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.790
 that appears obscured according 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.020
 then nothing simply to notice that the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.399
 text looks great 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.990
 the text we can configure it what 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.700
 we can put bigger smaller 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.799
 this to our liking I like to see it 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.030
 big and notice that here is a video 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.369
 in texas and from here we could 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.259
 perfectly play this video if 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.060
 we want to go to the website directly 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.280
 we give nothing to this little button of 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.159
 up on the right and see if 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.959
 I give it I'm not giving it now if 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.969
 given and we 're going to launch the 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.340
 webpage to this article on your page 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.690
 web of agreement we are going to be a little bit 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.640
 to see if it charges 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.200
 perfect since we already have it already loaded 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.480
 notice that we will be able to see the fit in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.240
 yes with the article or we will be able to go to 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.160
 the website or if we want not good what 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.720
 more we can do here apart from this 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.090
 for me one thing that is imperative 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.370
 is that I will be able to add channels of 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.540
 youtube and this seems very very cool to me 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.600
 because the truth is that it took time 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.340
 trying to put YouTube feeds in 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.020
 in my google reader account and not what 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.250
 I got it because I did not get the film right or 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.660
 At least I did not know how 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.830
 find it in the case that with this 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.690
 application we simply give to the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.430
 little button on the top right that is 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.170
 this one that puts more and notice that here 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.330
 we will be able to look for any type of 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.470
 blog for example let's find a blog 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.210
 which is a famous for example the one of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.380
 xataka agree and fix those here 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.630
 Well, nothing we could simply 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.460
 subscribe if we click here in the block of 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.470
 xataka we are not going to look for example my 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.490
 blog that is the aysén a code that as 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.710
 you know now I have a new 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.240
 collaborator my friend javi we thank you 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.160
 is helping to write an article 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.630
 another in the post on the pad so 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.220
 I thank you so much javi greetings 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.630
 from here it's good to see that we're going to 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.010
 search in saná court and automatically 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.110
 the first entry is going to be my 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.820
 blog not cool things if we put that not 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.140
 cultivate what is this youtube channel 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.209
 where you are right now 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.740
 notice that I will be able to subscribe to 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.420
 this to my YouTube channel 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.250
 note that we are going to distinguish it because 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.870
 the incognito is a square a 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.970
 rectangle in red with a triangle 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.620
 these of frei no but as I do not want to be 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.570
 egocentric I'm not going to subscribe to my 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.700
 own channel I will recommend my channel 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.850
 from your favorite YouTube that is neither more nor 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.120
 less than the out of consumer that ever 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.620
 what you see out consumer according to him 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.390
 we are going to give to look and to fix that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.070
 appears first of all we do not 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.420
 we put here here we could change the 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.980
 name we could put in some 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.870
 folder we can create a new folder 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.760
 to put this feed in this case we're going 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.710
 to give the safety what we are going to have here 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.600
 underneath right now you already appear here 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.660
 do not notice that he tells me that I have 10 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.040
 items pending reading not because the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.380
 true that when you subscribe to a feed 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.090
 lets you read the last 10 articles 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.580
 but the good thing about this is that 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.500
 when this guy consumes upload a video 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.570
 new to me will appear here as 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.920
 that I have pending to see what I 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.380
 It seems essential not to get lost 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.330
 no video from my YouTube channels 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.310
 favorites do not notice that we get 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.530
 here we are going to see all of them 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.120
 the last 10 videos in this case we 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.940
 we put in the first and notice that 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.460
 clicking on this icon here we are going to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.230
 go to the youtube page 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.050
 to play the video quietly 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.730
 from here not 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.960
 this seems pretty cool to me because 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.700
 As I tell you, many of you have asked me 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.970
 sometime how do I do to not get lost 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.290
 no video because of course I would like 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.610
 receive an email or some move 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.160
 you are simply with this 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.480
 music application and that is universal 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.010
 and you are going to be able to use it both in 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.690
 ipad like on the iphone you are going to be able to 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.459
 subscribe to my YouTube channel or to 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.799
 that you want to not lose yourself 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.390
 no video properly this is a 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.220
 feed reader and the best of all is 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.960
 that we will be able to read our 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.790
 blog articles to which 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.130
 we follow our blogs or 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.840
 favorite websites do not notice that I 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.520
 I tell you all these blogs here also 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.250
 I have some organized by folders 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.060
 video game technology android 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.160
 of support in English of apple to fix that 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.990
 here I follow all these blogs so nothing 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.690
 we just get in anybody in 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.010
 applesfera for example to determine that from 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.450
 here I have all these articles 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.190
 Pending to read that in this case 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.930
 see what he tells me I'm 29 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.940
 articles not yet read 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.260
 then I get in here and notice that 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.580
 when I give this little button here 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.460
 one cool thing is that I can change 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.140
 the view I give to switch view fixes 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.120
 that now I'm going to see her some view of 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.949
 newspaper not for me it is more comfortable 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.150
 here the newspaper view already used it 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.860
 on the ipad because the screen is more 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.360
 great and she is doing well but in the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.830
 iphone I like more to use this type 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.740
 of sight because I see it much more 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.540
 neat and organized good things cool 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.220
 check that we're going to go to the adjustments 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.650
 from here we will be able to put our 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.030
 Google account that is not fijaros 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.310
 here we will also be able to modify the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.960
 arctic size the font size that is this 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.699
 from here from here a very cool thing is 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.080
 that we are going to be able to, I have put the 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.180
 font type butt because to me 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.639
 like that we can put it smaller 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.500
 if we want not in medium in very large in 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.150
 big as we want what I 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.010
 I have here to notice that if I put it in 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.350
 medium as the posts are going to 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.310
 go again to apolo sphere and fix 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.900
 that we are going to get into the first 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.669
 article fix that in the text you see 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.590
 smaller I do not like to me on sight 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.210
 big so as not to strain the view so 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.569
 we're going to leave it big we're going to say 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.289
 from here and we're going to leave this in 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.029
 Yuko 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.979
 okay is an application that 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.930
 It serves for this I would advise you that 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.999
 metais in google reader and put there 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.680
 all your favorite blogs for not 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.749
 lose any article because then 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.210
 when you change reader application 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:10.529
 of fitz on the iphone or on the ipad but 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.599

 google and you're going to have all of you there 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.869
 Fitz is a pretty cool application 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.610
 Perez that also has pretty things 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:20.759
 low before finishing I would like 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.430
 tell you that we will also be able to 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.839
 gestures move to the second article this is 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.279
 configurable according to what we can put 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.629
 as we want the mass that 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.129
 we have buttons to go to the previous 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:30.869
 article or to go to the next article 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.639
 If we like this article and we want it
