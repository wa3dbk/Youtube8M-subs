rate<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:57.030> stack<00:01:57.360> seemed<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> last<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.259> about

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
rate the stack seemed to last for about

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.990 
rate the stack seemed to last for about
15<00:02:00.450> seconds<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.159> stacks<00:02:02.430> degrade

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
15 seconds or so but the stacks degrade

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660 
15 seconds or so but the stacks degrade
like<00:02:03.390> as<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.079> them<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.860> there's<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> act

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
like as you get them so there's the act

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
like as you get them so there's the act
right<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.540> increase<00:02:07.409> your

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
right there as you can see increase your

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
right there as you can see increase your
fire<00:02:07.770> rate<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.099> reload<00:02:08.580> speed<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.119> also

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
fire rate and reload speed it will also

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.160 
fire rate and reload speed it will also
give<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.340> pretty<00:02:11.340> decent<00:02:11.970> odds<00:02:12.170> capacity

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
give you pretty decent odds capacity

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.910 
give you pretty decent odds capacity
which<00:02:13.620> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
which is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
which is
really<00:02:14.160> nice<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.300> let's<00:02:15.599> just<00:02:15.750> go<00:02:15.840> ahead<00:02:15.900> and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
really nice so let's just go ahead and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.210 
really nice so let's just go ahead and
cut<00:02:16.349> over<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.550> rk5<00:02:18.209> fight<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.319> we'll

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
cut over to the rk5 fight here and we'll

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.370 
cut over to the rk5 fight here and we'll
go<00:02:20.400> ahead<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.700> take<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> look<00:02:21.330> at<00:02:21.510> what<00:02:22.349> exactly

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
go ahead and take a look at what exactly

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.860 
go ahead and take a look at what exactly
this<00:02:23.130> thing<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.550> do<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.849> terms<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.209> increasing

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
this thing can do in terms of increasing

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.020 
this thing can do in terms of increasing
your<00:02:25.020> rate<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> fire<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> we're<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.880> go

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
your rate of fire so we're going to go

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.140 
your rate of fire so we're going to go
ahead<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.690> at<00:02:27.870> him<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.410> corrosive
