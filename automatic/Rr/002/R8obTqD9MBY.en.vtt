for the first time and they're doing a

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.439 
for the first time and they're doing a
simple<00:00:56.589> experiment<00:00:57.070> just<00:00:57.550> trying<00:00:58.119> to<00:00:58.239> see<00:00:58.360> an

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
simple experiment just trying to see an

simple experiment just trying to see an
LED<00:00:58.869> blink<00:00:59.610> what<00:01:00.610> happens<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:04.600> have<00:01:04.869> our<00:01:05.110> class

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
LED blink what happens we have our class

LED blink what happens we have our class
instructions<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.220> would<00:01:06.310> be<00:01:06.460> three<00:01:06.670> hours

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
instructions that would be three hours

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.640 
instructions that would be three hours
of<00:01:06.970> lecturing<00:01:07.240> two<00:01:07.570> hours<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:07.930> lab<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.439> there's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
of lecturing two hours of lab so there's

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.710 
of lecturing two hours of lab so there's
plenty<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:08.979> time<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.400> see<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.880> everything<00:01:10.630> we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
plenty of time to see that everything we

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.149 
plenty of time to see that everything we
discussed<00:01:11.170> in<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.500> classroom<00:01:12.009> and

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
discussed in the classroom and

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.440 
discussed in the classroom and
everything<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:12.520> did<00:01:12.700> worked<00:01:13.000> on<00:01:13.180> for

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
everything you did worked on for

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.240 
everything you did worked on for
homework<00:01:13.750> when<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.710> come<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.100> lab

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
homework when you come to the lab

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.600 
homework when you come to the lab
actually<00:01:15.670> does<00:01:16.119> indeed<00:01:16.390> work<00:01:17.040> there<00:01:18.040> is<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.189> lot

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
actually does indeed work there is a lot

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.520 
actually does indeed work there is a lot
of<00:01:18.729> math<00:01:18.909> involved<00:01:18.939> they<00:01:19.750> will<00:01:19.990> need<00:01:20.259> to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
of math involved they will need to

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.460 
of math involved they will need to
develop<00:01:21.310> good<00:01:21.759> skills<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.390> algebra<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.170> drink

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
develop good skills in algebra and drink

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.280 
develop good skills in algebra and drink
the<00:01:24.070> math<00:01:24.280> allows<00:01:24.700> us<00:01:25.030> predict<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.810> results

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
the math allows us predict the results

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.620 
the math allows us predict the results
and<00:01:26.829> you<00:01:26.950> would<00:01:27.070> have<00:01:27.250> when<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:27.850> put<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.270> circuit

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
and you would have when we put a circuit

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.730 
and you would have when we put a circuit
together<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.790> electronics<00:01:31.420> we<00:01:32.080> also

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
together for the electronics we also

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.390 
together for the electronics we also
will<00:01:33.670> have<00:01:33.850> them<00:01:34.150> study<00:01:34.990> calculus<00:01:35.920> one<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
will have them study calculus one and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.000 
will have them study calculus one and
two<00:01:36.580> but<00:01:37.300> that's<00:01:37.450> primarily<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:38.440> enable<00:01:38.860> them

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
two but that's primarily to enable them

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.430 
two but that's primarily to enable them
to<00:01:39.190> go<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.700> further<00:01:39.850> education<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.380> have

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
to go on to further education you have

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.440 
to go on to further education you have
to<00:01:41.650> know<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.800> lot<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.130> electronics<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.060> math

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
to know a lot of electronics and math

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.930 
to know a lot of electronics and math
and<00:01:43.990> basic<00:01:44.620> communications<00:01:45.610> with<00:01:45.820> other
