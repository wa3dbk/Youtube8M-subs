would<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> hydrogen

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
would be right now but it's a hydrogen

would be right now but it's a hydrogen
fuel<00:00:36.600> cell<00:00:36.899> car<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> thousand

miles<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> belly<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.090> hydrogen<00:00:42.570> except<00:00:42.899> it

miles on a belly of hydrogen except it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.990 
miles on a belly of hydrogen except it
wouldn't<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> belly<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.860> hydrogen<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.850> would

wouldn't be a belly of hydrogen it would

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
wouldn't be a belly of hydrogen it would
be<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> body<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.809> hydrogen<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.469> see<00:00:46.770> they're

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
be a body of hydrogen you see they're

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
be a body of hydrogen you see they're
going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> store<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.030> hydrogen<00:00:48.210> compressed

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
going to store the hydrogen compressed

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
going to store the hydrogen compressed
in<00:00:49.320> cavities<00:00:50.309> around<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.059> body<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.600> think

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
in cavities around the body and I think

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360 
in cavities around the body and I think
I've<00:00:51.809> heard<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.289> before<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.860> any<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I've heard of that before in any of the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
I've heard of that before in any of the
various<00:00:53.489> hydrogen<00:00:54.180> concepts<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.899> out

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
various hydrogen concepts that are out

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
various hydrogen concepts that are out
there<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:55.710> let's<00:00:55.890> talk<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
there now let's talk about some of the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
there now let's talk about some of the
technology<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.420> consumer

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
technology that's more consumer

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.930 
technology that's more consumer
electronics<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.190> doors<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.850> they

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
electronics you see these doors as they

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
electronics you see these doors as they
go<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.270> down<00:01:00.449> those<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:00.899> gesture<00:01:01.469> control

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
go up and down those are gesture control

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.529 
go up and down those are gesture control
so<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.309> walk<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> door<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.359> go

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
so you walk up to the door and just go

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.810 
so you walk up to the door and just go
huh<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.470> door<00:01:04.650> goes<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.250> then<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.670> door

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
huh the door goes up and then the door

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
huh the door goes up and then the door
goes<00:01:06.030> down<00:01:06.270> you've<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.140> gesture

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
goes down you've also got gesture

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
goes down you've also got gesture
control<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.430> nice<00:01:08.729> big<00:01:09.060> display<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
control on that nice big display for the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
control on that nice big display for the
passenger<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.530> want<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> next

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
passenger if they want to go to the next

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270

track<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> DVD<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.200> CD<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.100> this

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
track on a DVD or a CD they just do this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
track on a DVD or a CD they just do this
kind<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.840> menu<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.470> sort<00:01:16.710> of

kind of thing menu all this sort of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.469 
kind of thing menu all this sort of
thing<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.729> Kinect<00:01:18.270> for

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
thing is very much like Kinect for
