purely<00:01:48.329> from<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> Sun<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.049> our<00:01:49.140> solar<00:01:49.439> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
purely from the Sun with our solar so

purely from the Sun with our solar so
the<00:01:50.520> solar<00:01:50.759> power<00:01:51.060> which<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.539> DC<00:01:51.990> gets

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the solar power which is DC gets

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.940 
the solar power which is DC gets
converted<00:01:52.619> into<00:01:53.039> AC<00:01:53.630> which<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> 240<00:01:55.289> volts<00:01:55.679> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
converted into AC which is 240 volts and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010 
converted into AC which is 240 volts and
then<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.399> convert<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.819> back<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.179> DC<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.869> can

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
then we convert it back to DC so we can

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
then we convert it back to DC so we can
charge<00:01:58.229> our<00:01:58.560> batteries<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> how<00:01:59.819> we

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
charge our batteries so this is how we

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
charge our batteries so this is how we
store<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.899> normal<00:02:01.049> situation<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.799> the
