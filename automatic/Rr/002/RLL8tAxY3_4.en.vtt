00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.909
 summer vacation I was waiting with 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.710

 my mom was going to go buy some things to 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.780
 a square where luckily for me 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.060

 if I could stay there for a while in what 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.690
 I bought it I doubt it a little but it left me 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.340
 stay when I went in I was playing with 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.920
 the consoles that were there for testing and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.900
 watching the games when the store is 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.580
 beat for a moment the one that charged me 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.620
 He said go and I thought I was going to 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.480
 scold for just being there playing with 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.880
 the consoles and not buy anything but not 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.560
 it was like that he told me hey you would not want to be 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.020

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.150

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.160
 I thought he was going to bring me a statue to 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.660
 get into something like that but when you 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.880
