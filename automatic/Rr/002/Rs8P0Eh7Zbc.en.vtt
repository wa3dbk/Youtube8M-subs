00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.080 
some categories in order to get out of
debt<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:38.579> your<00:03:39.150> income<00:03:39.650> minus<00:03:40.650> all<00:03:41.090> your

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
expenses equals zero so every dollar is

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.670 
expenses equals zero so every dollar is
assigned<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.389> category<00:03:48.629> so<00:03:49.349> that's<00:03:49.500> how<00:03:49.620> you

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680

budget<00:03:50.069> pretty<00:03:50.730> easy<00:03:51.030> it's<00:03:51.389> gonna<00:03:51.540> take<00:03:51.780> about

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
budget pretty easy it's gonna take about

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.259 
budget pretty easy it's gonna take about
three<00:03:52.230> months<00:03:52.379> to<00:03:52.709> get<00:03:52.889> it<00:03:53.010> right<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.669> you've
