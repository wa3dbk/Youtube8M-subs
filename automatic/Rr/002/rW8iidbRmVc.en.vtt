in this stage you have to pull the lime

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:39.250 
in this stage you have to pull the lime
juice<00:01:27.840> inside<00:01:28.840> milk

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.900 

have<00:01:40.260> to<00:01:40.440> start<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.980> steal<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.580> milk

have to start to steal that milk
continuously<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.660> milk<00:01:45.870> will<00:01:46.080> not

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
continuously so that the milk will not

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.889 
continuously so that the milk will not
get<00:01:46.740> stick<00:01:47.190> in<00:01:47.780> Everson

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.450 

stir<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.859> milk<00:01:52.039> continuously<00:01:52.640> I<00:01:54.280> have<00:01:55.280> added

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
stir the milk continuously I have added

even one more tablespoon of lime juice

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.029 
even one more tablespoon of lime juice
so<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.659> curling<00:02:00.079> gets<00:02:00.439> even<00:02:01.009> more

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
so that the curling gets even more

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.109 
so that the curling gets even more
faster<00:02:02.740> where<00:02:03.740> we<00:02:03.829> can<00:02:04.039> find<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.579> curling's

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
faster where we can find the curling's

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.219 
faster where we can find the curling's
or<00:02:05.210> here<00:02:07.000> now<00:02:08.000> we<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.269> find<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.690> milk<00:02:08.989> or
