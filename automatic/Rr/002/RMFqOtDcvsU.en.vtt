00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.510
 we all know the fire of 1700 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.570
 which is one of the fundamentals of 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.150
 the urban evolution of lalime which is 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.960
 currently included in the revision of the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.390
 saved sector 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.980
 this event the 1720 fire 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.260
 very important in the history of the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.059
 city ​​and in the collective unconscious the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.340
 Rennes is also taken over by 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.000
 the archbishop trial saint marc who said 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.570
 to reindeer a link to take except the fire 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.500
 in 1720 the fire took by a shop 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.040
 a shopkeeper what tells in any case 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.440
 the carpenter traders legend who 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.320
 by clumsiness at a thousand lights in his 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.930
 house is going on in the month of December and 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.080
 in December all areas 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.840
 both ten candles from the wax of the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.420
 fat stored in 10 in the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.230
 cupboards and wood obviously for 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.810
 prepare the winter the population panics 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.490
 the first day the fire the six days in 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 everything and also tells that the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.150
 soldiers from the swat that came 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.590
 had to be there to help the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.610
 population for the trend in ten years 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.310
 earlier participated in the looting of 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.710
 real estate objects by jean etc 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.450
 which did not help the story or the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.220
 sixth day seeing that he was 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.350
 extremely complicated step this 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.550
 fire it was decided by the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.470
 local government to shoot down homes 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.430
 to identify fires and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.890
 prevent the spread obviously 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.509
 the felling of his houses to accentuate 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.890
 the somewhat traumatic effect of 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.890
 the event with the population 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.640
 e 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.640
 the balance sheet is heavy about 1000 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.340
 homeless people so cunning 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.760
 burned nearly 1,000 houses a little 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.530
 less without some houses of emoluments 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.190
 also emblematic of the city have 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.170
 disappeared the barracks are 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.990
 built urgently in the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.610
 outskirts of the city for the g 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.170
 no one obviously Libyans have disappeared 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.630
 who is it 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.350
 by the way socially engendered the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.510
 misery of insecurity since 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.160
 people coming from the countryside to 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.209
 help with reconstruction is also 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.350
 poorly housed and participate in this 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:04.230
 difficulty of urban existence series of 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:07.020
 criteria the aura of francs according to that 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.130
 missionne architects gentlemen of 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.220
 robien to write the new story 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.820
 city ​​of Rennes with 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.230
 buildings also built according to 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.769
 security settings 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.650
 we talk about civil security and also 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.680
 obviously fire safety and the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.740
 robin plan and see especially for these 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.870
 reasons there the demolition of 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.120
 medieval neighborhoods still in place 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.230
 around the reindeer cathedral 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.600
 and then turning that saint-georges 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.910
 example population and authority 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.800
 local refused robin's plan the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.950
 boss that so missioned a new 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.960
 architect architect gabriel a kit 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.050
 also architect of the king and that he has 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.830
 proposed an alternative assets to this 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.520
 urbanism it is this plan that the power 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:07.560
 today and that picks up 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.690
 provisions related to this concern for 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.850
 this memory of same fire this 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.260
 trauma by provisions 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.430
 architectural gold what is 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.070
 interesting is that the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.100
 eighteenth century provisions of the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.440
 so modern city takes over 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.620
 provisions of the medieval town in 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.990
 what she had 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.990
 somehow safe 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.820
 so 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.510
 it is true that the trauma of 1720 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.940
 in the history of the city of reindeers 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.580
 is kept alive in the memories 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.210
 probably also because of 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.880
 fires that have been created 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:57.320
 recently we think obviously followed 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.150
 strongly brittany also thinks about 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.350
 those downtown including the lots 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.180
 sani chain that burned recently so 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.960
 another notion in the development of 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.490
 planning documents and is interesting 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.690
 compared to the sector review 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.350
 saved current it is a question of 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.780
 of these security provisions a 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.180
 planning document that can 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.340
 qualify as anticipation obviously a 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.620
 planning document is always done 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.620
 for ten or twenty years to come 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.080
 that of the saved reindeer sector 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.730
 it is written in such a way as to anticipate 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.730
 on the evolutions 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.710
 used of life and it's interesting 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.490
 to put this idea in parallel 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:56.980
 with the first planning document the 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:06:00.290
 twentieth century city that did not allow 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.210
 to anticipate changes in 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.430
 uses 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.800
 I mean by that in the second part 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.300
 of the 20th century the city of Rennes is 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.700
 a much developed front and has 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.710
 much develop the welcome of 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.480
 students and welcome to this 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.200
 population has generated some 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.170
 typology of habitat 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.970
 it is typology of habitat of the only fact 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.060
 to be pregnant it serves and register 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.830
 in furniture- style buildings put 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.960
 yours and the eighteenth century which 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:35.870
 were not always planned for 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:41.600
 welcome this type of population the the 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:45.940
 planning regulations do not necessarily 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.530
 anticipated in a very rational way 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.080
 the looks of the cycles of the sq and 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.890
 Fire particular threshold reception 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.140
 of these populations 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:58.940
 it seemed interesting that on 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.530
 this idea there even if a little this 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.190
 trauma or wish this 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.230
 collective consciousness 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:12.920
 fire risk reindeer always 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:16.800
 endures and that the facilities 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.580
 still are supported by this idea 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.540
 background somehow 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.400
 maybe the old regulations 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.390
 were not able to anticipate 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.280
 on this problem of evolution 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.230
 uses 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.130
 it's someone today and it's a 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:34.760
 old assets very strong new at 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.760
 people to domains
