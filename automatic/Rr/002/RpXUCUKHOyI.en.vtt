00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello tankers with you 40 tons and again 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.920
 I announce what many have been waiting for me 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.170
 it is gold contest again now i want 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.179
 show you the introductory situation which 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
 I liked it I called it for myself 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.949
 so just for fun shot of the week 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 although naturally I donâ€™t think it is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.420
 the most mega nibigatorsky there some 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 shot in the tanks of course not but me 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 He liked it so look what 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.189
 the situation is i have my sovzvodny on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.649
 batchat 155 there with. 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.020
 enemy level 10 who broke through and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.820
 now here comes to exactly what has 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.120
 threatens to kill on his comrades 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.219
 he is pretty strong that is comrade 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 it alone is very unlikely to remove 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.510
 and I have the choice to drive around to the left 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.239
 or here on the right try somehow 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.149
 the mountains are getting in the way here I decide 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.340
 I still have time to see it on the right 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.820
 I roll back I think that my shell 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.449
 the trajectory will go round all the same here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.299
 surface and really find here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.909
 I think about such a trajectory as 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.650
 he will go 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.830
 where is it going to light up here comrade rides on 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.659
 meeting him a little chance little but 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.369
 so very with droplets on his forehead 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.659
 so very very carefully I aim and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.780
 look look look look op 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.860
 projectile goes and hits him exactly 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 breaks through the stern 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.110
 here so that's pretty tricky clever 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.119
 vanshotom here in this schelochku to between 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.530
 red lines here so a little bit 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.170
 the green is saved by my friend Respect 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.200
 to each other unsubscribed well, rather 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 voice communications cut out to each other 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.649
