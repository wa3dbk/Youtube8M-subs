00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
up with my particular foot shape so

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.759 
up with my particular foot shape so

that you can't see and that gives you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.250 
that you can't see and that gives you
the<00:02:53.069> amount<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.549> flex<00:02:53.910> or<00:02:54.180> not<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.110> boot

and this has a much stiffer midsole and

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.569 
and this has a much stiffer midsole and
that<00:02:57.720> tells<00:02:57.959> me<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.829> for<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.130> steeper

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
that tells me that this is for a steeper

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.460 
that tells me that this is for a steeper
environment<00:03:00.180> while<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> might<00:03:00.959> be<00:03:01.110> standing<00:03:01.410> on

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
footbed to support my calves and then

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.880 
footbed to support my calves and then
when<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:08.970> twist<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.450> boot<00:03:09.630> torsionally<00:03:10.349> it's

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
when I twist the boot torsionally it's

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.120 
when I twist the boot torsionally it's
got<00:03:11.160> superb<00:03:11.819> torsional<00:03:12.599> stability<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.349> if

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
got superb torsional stability and if

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.710 
got superb torsional stability and if
you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.700> think<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.090> when<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.299> walk<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.599> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
you can think that when you walk up a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.190 
you can think that when you walk up a
steep<00:03:15.930> slope<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.440> generally<00:03:17.160> zigzag<00:03:18.200> this

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
steep slope you generally zigzag this

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.090 
steep slope you generally zigzag this
boot<00:03:19.440> will<00:03:20.010> handle<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:21.030> side<00:03:21.450> on<00:03:22.100> loading

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
boot will handle the side on loading

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.280 
boot will handle the side on loading
that<00:03:23.700> happens<00:03:24.269> when<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.540> zigzag<00:03:24.750> up<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.049> slope

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
that happens when you zigzag up a slope

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.160 
that happens when you zigzag up a slope

a walking cramp on so how do I know what

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.760 
a walking cramp on so how do I know what
to<00:04:23.970> choose<00:04:24.000> well<00:04:24.479> it's<00:04:24.630> straightforward<00:04:25.229> what

to choose well it's straightforward what
I<00:04:25.800> do<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.400> think<00:04:26.520> where<00:04:26.849> do<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.000> go<00:04:27.120> walking
