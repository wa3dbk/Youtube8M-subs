you know getting the cornmeal on the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.410 
you know getting the cornmeal on the
peel<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.859> ride<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.880> comes<00:00:21.210> off

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
peel just ride so that it comes off

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.810 
peel just ride so that it comes off
perfectly<00:00:22.100> these<00:00:23.100> are<00:00:23.250> all<00:00:23.369> things<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.699> I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
perfectly these are all things that I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420 
perfectly these are all things that I
don't<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.150> want<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.480> about<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.470> one

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
don't really want to think about now one

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.220 
don't really want to think about now one
ball<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> dough<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.390> enough<00:00:27.689> pretty<00:00:28.050> much

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
ball of the dough is enough pretty much

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
ball of the dough is enough pretty much
for<00:00:28.410> two<00:00:28.529> pizzas<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.630> split<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.869> half

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
for two pizzas so I split it in half

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:41.660 
for two pizzas so I split it in half
here<00:00:38.420> start<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> roll<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:41.100> first<00:00:41.309> pizza

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
here start to roll out the first pizza

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.930 
here start to roll out the first pizza
now<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:44.239> find<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:46.489> my<00:00:47.489> kids<00:00:47.730> don't

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
now I find that my kids don't

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.639 
now I find that my kids don't
particularly<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.870> eat<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> crust<00:00:49.440> on

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
particularly like to eat the crust on

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.639 
particularly like to eat the crust on
pizza<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.719> if<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.899> roll<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.379> completely

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pizza so if I roll it out completely

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.270 
pizza so if I roll it out completely
flat<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.030> thin<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.510> possibly<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.280> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
flat and as thin as I possibly can it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
flat and as thin as I possibly can it
kind<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> maximizes<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> amount<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
kind of maximizes the amount of the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.529 
kind of maximizes the amount of the
pizza<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.379> actually<00:00:58.739> gets<00:00:58.949> eaten

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.179 

fact<00:01:03.539> that's<00:01:03.750> also<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.229> tinfoil<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:05.010> makes

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
fact that's also on tinfoil also makes

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.960 
fact that's also on tinfoil also makes
it<00:01:05.390> easier<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> spin<00:01:06.750> around<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.939> deal<00:01:08.939> with

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it easier to spin around and deal with

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:23.940 
it easier to spin around and deal with
in<00:01:09.540> general

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.649 

I<00:01:26.430> usually<00:01:27.430> don't<00:01:27.700> concern<00:01:28.090> myself<00:01:28.270> too<00:01:28.630> much

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
I usually don't concern myself too much

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.820 
I usually don't concern myself too much
about<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.140> shape<00:01:29.439> it<00:01:29.680> ends<00:01:29.950> up<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:32.470> the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
about what shape it ends up the with the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.770 
about what shape it ends up the with the
tinfoil<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.460> kind<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.759> one<00:01:33.939> limiting<00:01:34.299> factor

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
tinfoil is kind of one limiting factor

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.600 
tinfoil is kind of one limiting factor
and<00:01:34.990> then<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.259> width<00:01:35.439> appeal<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.460> other

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
and then the width appeal is the other

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.480 
and then the width appeal is the other
looming<00:01:36.970> factor<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.680> comes<00:01:38.890> out<00:01:39.040> usually

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
looming factor so it comes out usually

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.109 
looming factor so it comes out usually
this<00:01:39.640> odd<00:01:40.060> kind<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.890> rectum<00:01:41.890> rectilinear<00:01:42.490> oval

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
this odd kind of rectum rectilinear oval

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.990 
this odd kind of rectum rectilinear oval
kind<00:01:43.360> of<00:01:43.420> shape<00:01:44.100> here's<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> sauce<00:01:45.399> basic

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
kind of shape here's the sauce basic
