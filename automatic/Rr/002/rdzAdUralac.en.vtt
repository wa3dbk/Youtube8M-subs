00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.840
 something like that goes off social family xl from him 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.630
 can cineplex one I can completely today 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.040
 hesse to re-video and before you 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.689
 maybe quite the commentary 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.939
 beginner ever gives a little 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.560
 mini spyder for the further course of the 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.420
 Kommandeurs and it will be later 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.740
 to go to the topic of music and get there 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.720
 I have a comment from each of you 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.460
 really from each of you 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.590
 therefore you can be more emotional 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.790
 Prepare and load your keyboard 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.230
 to write a comment according to 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.760
 can 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.530
 but first I have to say something 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.880
 why is there no facetime to see 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.890
 I think most of those 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.390
 our channel know us even know 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.100
 not more when our last fed not 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.930
 facebook comments was i know it first 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.399
 personally, but not there is one 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.250
 special reason why today is the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.660
 have omitted face com and that is 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.860
 the gameplay because I find the gameplay 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.140
 today, what's really right is right 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.180
 It is cool, but relatively often says 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.399
 This time it really knows where to go 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.660
 100 percent behind is when the whole 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.680
 a double is near and i ask 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.670
 also no longer make so exciting 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.229
 because I think we have the title 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.070
 that is a fucking 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.869
 doubleday in free for all yes and that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.549
 is just so abnormally crass and 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.500
 short explanation how to get in the game mode 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.700
 Twice 30 teams finish with 330 jpy 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.290
 It's easy to play 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.820
 cyclists I guess most people know 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.670
 but it is only about the discussion 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.110
 I say that quite normal and to prevent 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.130
 the whole thing just gets even more blatant 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.960
 if you just look at the weapon 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.979
 look at the whole is a weapon with the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.869
 I really never believe it 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.159
 I would play something voluntarily 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.680
 eyes turned out when I saw that 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.780
 just have it so incredibly ugly 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.490
 This one believes she is there 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.960
 not sure yet but I think 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.369
 the weapon is simply abnormally awful 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.049
 and as if that was not enough 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.909
 he has to play with his cap 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.320
 then I believe in the end 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.670
 loose over half of the kills 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.799
 block together by him 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.270
 different weapons from the opponents 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.220
 collect as well as I say times 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.990
 several kag sightsee a bit 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.280
 so it was burnt out 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.320
 really really crass is right 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.610
 of course again a gameplay of the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.469
 black stars how should it be otherwise 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.060
 really really cool plays 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.440
 and you looked at the definitely times 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.510
 You can also do it today 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.950
 zoom in on the picture if in 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.890
 The quality is not sugar now 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.840
 but I think that suits me 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.240
 wanted to say something short and have 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.590
 I 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.180
 forgot some video because video 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.010
 I started from something and that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 each one of you finally got our channel 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.650
 but knows now came in the last 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.210
 time a few comments below 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.260
 my videos are actually and are 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.910
 so again about the whole 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.590
 complete as the coach sees 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.840
 we make the channel in pairs me 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.390
 still together with Sandro and we have 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.040
 now after the legendary punishment 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.570
 Medium with ks what a few days ago 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.160
 the 8000 subscribers were highly praised 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.540
 you are ready to go 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.220
 to pull our channel in the video was 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.360
 really really funny wise is there wants 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.550
 I almost died 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.690
 but if you are thinking right now 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.510
 I on a parcours you see as 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.360
 latest video a video became me and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.640
 my partner together where my partner 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.810
 something very bad was involved 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.430
 I can give you my tracks of the videos 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.990
 years the title is sandro brutal 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.040
 must be so beaten up the 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.970
 new partners 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.650
 but I think you know that 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.450
 So most of you are welcome 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.710
 Also on our channel look at the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.480
 legendary metal and the latest video 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.920
 but now I finally want to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.460
 come to my topic after three minutes 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.870
 It's about music and I have it 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.130
 in the last time really such a small one 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.600
 problem i know that maybe too 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.580
 if you 're in your music james cook then 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.750
 your spotify is that they just are not 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.970
 should know what she hears because you 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.770
 just looking through everything and everything 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.200
 That's why I need help now 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.070
 only so that, so to speak, really little 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.080
 to hear everything 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.880
 no idea if you have one too 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.650
 Music artists have you higher 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.180
 which I can aim for now too 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.380
 I paint on the video I know 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.670
 not why I'm interested but 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.340
 I would be interested in how people look like 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.840
 about the same age group as you 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.610
 for music tastes and whether we are ourselves 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.170
 because they so let's leave a 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.640
 easier if now a new music 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.520
 artist was also here at the start 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.110
 and yes I can start very easy 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.750
 Jewish background this is the beat 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.120
 from high school by cindy from the album 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.190
 nwa and chemistry is simply absolute 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.350
 one of your favorite interpreters 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.140
 really nasty guy without shit are so 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.930
 nwr I celebrate it all the more so 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.219
 difficult 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.420
 I'm really horny too 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.069
 heard that many others the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.239
 I just love his music 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.640
 and that's why I would be very upset too 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.049
 This beat in the background generally too 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.329
 the rappers, of course, something like 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.609
 Kollegah father I have a lot 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.350
 bullet last bullet is here 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.489
 but the web business is clear 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.960
 had involved more has much 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.940
 much more idea there, of course, too 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.220
 very much like kipping and kipping 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.930
 generally also American rap 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.130
 I just play basketball and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.300
 That's how you get so forcibly 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.850
 a little bit in connection with it 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.710
 sma's as so many 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.009
 African American holding basketball game 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.570
 and that's why you come with it 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.090
 Forcibly, I noticed that 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.810
 the storm is in very big fitting fan 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.340
 in any case 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.440
 I was also abnormal and young to the boys 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.930
 I'm looking forward to the water Neuhaus 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.699
 then brings very much like that 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.349
 things like jack miller jack miller 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.940
 just a right really right 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.039
 crass singer, I think without shit 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.020
 in the beginning a little bit more 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.280
 device to do the best where you can 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.849
 may be known from the cd 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.440
 scene 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.000
 Of course, there is also mainstream 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.620
 things with this that you hear about something like 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.389
 david guetta of the now I believe so 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.070
 this angels song and of course this one 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.020
 Whole dubstep stuff whatever you put in 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.449
 Of course you also get clubs 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.250
 everything so with and in general the sap 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.539
 business alright so what the cd 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.830
 community concerns a lot of many 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.710
 pursue that he is very hard I believe 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.659
 i was sitting with jay jay patricks and me 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.570
 believe on the stand panda neviges 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.800
 could get out of this until you're done 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.090
 came the were really little after 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.150
 have already sat on one or the other 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.280
 others made by you and so without 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.199
 shit if you have any of you 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.370
 now have recognized that found 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.419
 as I said you could easily there 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.680
 I will let it be interesting how 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.539
 that looks like this in my age group 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.120
 I'm about the same 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.979
 music taste but in recent times 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.120
 is all that now synonymous one 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.800
 bit boring i have 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.509
 all heard by I know what I mean 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.340
 and that's why we write 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.229
 now necessarily in the comments your 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.360
 favorite he just hears it was 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.979
 things that come from the charts rap 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.630
 just do your favorite things again 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.180
 Can you write freely whether you 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.500
 a title two titles three titles 500 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.330
 title there and write in the comments 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.979
 It does not matter. I need it again 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.419
 little something I listen to music at 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.630
 otherwise on the way to school and 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.610
 back so a bit boring 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.740
 so please help me please please 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.850
 and you are welcome to do it if you do not 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.230
 Title so necessarily also liked 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.430
 I then search for interpreters 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.260
 me because even something out is relative 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.210
 easy at spotify on youtube this 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.590
 then look out or if you are now 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.510
 no real interpreter or one 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.610
 you can easily have easy titles as well
