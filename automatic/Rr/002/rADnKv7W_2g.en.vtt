00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.710
 speaks guys I'm Rodrigo and if you come here 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.210
 to make a quick comment about the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
 motorola vote g 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.910
 the younger brother and cheaper of the motorcycle 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.190
 x that was released a very short time ago 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.869
 In fact, his announcement event was here. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.520
 No Brazil in Sao Paulo 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.350
 two people have come to ask me 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.970
 rodrigo you think it 's worth it is a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.779
 good purchase option for the range of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.640
 price 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.650
 and although he only played with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.349
 quickly I think I can say that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.899
 Yes, it 's a good buy. It looks great. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.059
 cost benefit and interesting trip 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.890
 how motorola has become later 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.480
 which was acquired by google the best 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.290
 company in the intermediate segment here 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.410
 in Brazil 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.239
 devices with the configuration 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.780
 respected and with a high price 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.579
 the bike g for example has another 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 specification for the price it has 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.199
 1.2 ghz quad core processor has 1 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.370
 gb ram android 4.3 with 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.640
 update provided by 4.4 screens 4.5 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.619
 inches hd or r 280 by 720 with 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 finish mockery or we wait 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.850
 that she will not break so easy to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.360
 me this year are there that replace 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.360
 kings 93 in the middle segment the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.979
 months of 2003 have long been the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 my easy option to indicate the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.869
 people who come to ask a good option 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.729
 cost effective and are even good 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.460
 mainly for the price 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.380
 if charged and not charged for them 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.680
 now the g engine gives an updated 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.619
 in these specifications and continues with 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.400
 great price the motogp starts to be 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.240
 charged and 650 reais onwards ie 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.460
 great 650 reais per 700 has the version 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.340
 officially dual chip on motorola and there 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 has some more expensive color versions 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.299
 in a version that comes with harry phone 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.600
 but finally consider the base price 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.490
 which is 8 gigabytes is already four 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.189
 gigabytes more than three 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.210
 had built-in despite not having a 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.890
 micro SD 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.530
 this is something we can call 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.479
 attention here at first 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.580
 he does not have a micro sd card 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.620
 solve 3 500 for example 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.480
 but if you go see the iphone 4s by 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.000
 example is currently sold in brazil 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.550
 with eight gigabytes of input and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.959
 a lot of people buy without complaining about it 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.959
 something else we can call the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.810
 attention to think is that this 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.910
 motogp passer he is much more 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.520
 focused on energy savings than 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.250
 performance it is just a cortex at 7 o 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.380
 in the input segment is not as 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.030
 powerful as well as top mobile phones 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.880
 which are almost either I do not expect him to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.610
 go be a monster then clear the 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.750
 people you could say that respected 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.269
 mainly because it also has a 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.380
 graphics chip that is better than the 3 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.690
 it has a 305 adreno which is a good 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.640
 evolution on what came in the model 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.410
 Previous of the motorola and even better than me 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730
 I mentioned at the beginning of training here and 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.920
 be better for games I think 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.600
 this is something that matters a lot is 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.790
 a cheap samba but also wants to give a 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.920
 played whenever possible who knows if 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.810
 it will run the things that you go 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.360
 try everything else and I think the pilot 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.640
 will have to account well yes 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.459
 if you want to buy, keep an eye on it 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.130
 because the official value of it is 650 reais 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.290
 but I've seen it and now it has been released 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.900
 now solving and promotions in 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.940
 forums on sites that do this 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.549
 disclosure it will be sold for 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.180
 less the 8 gigabyte version with a 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:35.510
 single thing of 500 reais and the dual version 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.540
 16gb chip for 600 reais is very much the same 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.810
 that the tabulated value is a great option 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.489
 great option it is very good to 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.230
 something I did not say he does not have 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.420
 the same software functions 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.150
 smart like bike x for example not 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.070
 has that 100% voice control that the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.500
 phone is far from you just talk to 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.320
 he already responds for more that he does not have 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.670
 this in voice control more in the 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.920
 search engine that is one thing 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.329
 a little more limited but it is the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.430
 that we have in most androids 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.790
 nowadays only taking stock 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.920
 general of these not-so-cool things like that. 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.870
 I said and what I think is good 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.599
 what is good stands out much more and 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.849
 yes I think the g motor is a buy 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.209
 smart and like I already said a lot 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.489
 for me 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.949
 will be an easy option to indicate the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.780
 people who ask me what cell phone 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.419
 I think they should buy without 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.280
 I spend a lot of it, I say here that 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.800
 Did you also find motogp 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.810
 If someone already has one I hope to test the 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.120
 background soon and if you liked this 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.919
 video clip I liked to help me in 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.419
 clear disclosure is the first video 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.979
 knowing on the channel to sign up if 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.000
 you follow up on videos in the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.139
 youtube 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.880
 I'm staying here for what our 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.880
 you and said
