00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.000
 high-end samsung with a screen 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.379
 bigger than the previous one compared 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.880
 to the guys here is round and especially 5 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.159
 inch it's thinner and more 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.510
 light 130 g é more powerful well 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 obviously a photo sensor of 3 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 megapixels it brings a lot of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.270
 new software level sends 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.189
 very samsung put the package on it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.040
 video a little more complete there it was 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.009
 specificity of galaxy s four for you 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 put a little water in the mouth 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.570
 a foretaste look at it actually it's 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.090
 a function that is quite amusing 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.880
 a bit like on the galaxy note this can 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.229
 to be you used this phone with 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.299
 the style is just approaching 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 style and we interacted with the screen 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.360
 is there no pen on 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.920
 the galaxy s 4 just approach the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.930
 simply needs to have some 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.250
 additional information on the screen 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.869
 for example you are in the process of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.159
 watch an email you approach your 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.100
 finger and well you're going to have some 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.790
 additional information in any case 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 the whole of Maine in any case a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.100
 part 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 we can imagine that too for the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.460
 calendar for contacts etc 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530
