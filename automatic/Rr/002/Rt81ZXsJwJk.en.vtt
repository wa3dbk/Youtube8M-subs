00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.790
 occupy 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.610
 We start to try the area 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.340
 to maintain pyramidal system that is 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.010
 13 teams 3 twelve teams and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 become slimmer in the upper part 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 The area is there for us 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.470
 of course, the promotion of all players 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.269

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.590
 from the u 14 we work 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 performance oriented and u16 area 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.840
 we already play a youth bundesliga 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.360
 you can already do that from us 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.800
 Performance training and how it works 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.710
 generally the introduction of this 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 Youth player at the men's area 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.280
 we try the as early as possible 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.750
 additionally in a second 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 youth team or if it works too 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960
 play in adequate men's teams 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
 allow 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.830
 all nbbl players play with us 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.270
 either in the first regional league in 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 the second men's team or in the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 third men's team 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.850
 It is important to get this other one very early 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 know playing style and, indeed, 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.150
 to get to know the other physically and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 Of course, our idea is with us 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 our players with our own 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.790
 plants as early as possible in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 to a highest possible play class too 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.280
 such want with these 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.500
 young players with german players 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 very early game experience on highest 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.340
 level collect which connecting points 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.479
 there is between the food area 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.159
 at bayern basketball and the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.840
 professional team is the number one 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.220
 certainly this brand all 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.380
 teams from fc bavaria munich 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.149
 want with great self-confidence 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.229
 occur and a winning mentality 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.030
 represent 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.920
 it is now so that every team 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.119
 no matter if you are against a circle class 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.350
 Team or a Bundesliga 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.430
 team plays everyone wants the fc 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.439
 bavaria munchen beat 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.649
 and that's why mentality is the art 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.060
 and how important we are to how we act 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.220
 second we want to be a team 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 which determines the game if you 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.420
 Come in you can see that we are up 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.460
 to defend intensely that we always 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.160
 pro are also active 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.110
 the defensive is attacking and attacking 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.760
 so that we have the varied talents 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.600
 and potential that our players have 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.490
 want to use 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.290
 we do not want to press them 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.500
 but where we live in 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.320
 junior area the play ability 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.880
 develop and have a game system what 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.420
 many possibilities for the players 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.490
 The older you get the more against 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.970
 the game systems then in the nbbl area 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.830
 mens 2 area to the bbl approach 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.900

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.350
 and then discuss which systems 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.350
 take over 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.120
