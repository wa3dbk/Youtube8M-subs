00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
but they normally end up being very

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.940 
but they normally end up being very
small<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:03.180> fix<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.380> continuously

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
minutes and let dry in between this way

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.460 
minutes and let dry in between this way
you<00:02:11.190> will<00:02:11.459> slowly<00:02:11.850> build<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.630> big<00:02:12.930> hard<00:02:13.200> drop

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you will slowly build up a big hard drop

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.270 
you will slowly build up a big hard drop
on<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.920> top<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> toothpick<00:02:15.860> then<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.100> can

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
on the top of the toothpick then you can

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.019 
on the top of the toothpick then you can
use<00:02:17.519> this<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.940> create<00:02:18.239> larger<00:02:18.780> dots
