 with the electoral pact 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.739
 more private resources in www points connects tutorials percent 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.659
 the pilots 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.480
 of mediaon other total in denver we will not explain how we can eliminate 

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.969
 completely woman 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.030
 for it according to the created document that can suppress one of the objects that I 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.629
 they come by default selection to the cube delete after that the court 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.050
 I will do the same with light 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.300
 pd was injured with the right button delete after that cut 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.790
 I will create a scenario quickly 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.479
 squeezed for this city atm in his plans 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.880
 with the key I waited a little bit bigger 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.570
 and entered the mode edith moraes 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.950
 today to work with edges was injured is seen here i applied a 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.509
 destruction for it 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.509
 press the style key that otegi 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.000
 once I have expression I go to camera 3 and I give something higher 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.490
 we went through here 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.759
 I think some new facet use the atp 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:19.900
 the key ll 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.900
 i the zetaparo key what to the height 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.420
 and worked much less 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.189
 I already have my plan created and can hurt some properties for it 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.109
 I go to the mode 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.500
 hey 9 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 can open a sux modifier 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.780
 the everest we go to no one three levels as well as in rendering levels 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.810
 we will also ask 3 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.570
 activity we have the vision mode so that if we enter the isthmus of 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.430
 how to select the edges 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.360
 we have the senate to the top track we press the key of muskiz 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 it does not return the square figure that we had initially 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.630
 we do the same in the lower part we select with the right button 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.760
 we aspire the key she clicks 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.630
 once we have done this we are going to be able to enter we have to be able to 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.459
 Add 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.530
 for example 700 for having a smoothing 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.660
 with that key we're going to be able to make it a little bigger as well 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.659
 we press the sx key we will be able to work 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.379
 with a greater width 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.419
 I'm in camera 7 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.779
 he injured the camera that comes by default and pressed the g key 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.949
 I'll take it around here 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:34.770
 with the r key I'm going to modify that I pointed to the center they were going to go a monkey 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.139
 spacebar at months monte 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.589
 will place the world better 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.310
 puts it a little higher 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.909
 press the rj key action blocked the x-axis ti 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.429
 we place in the hands of the monkey 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.679
 if tight 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:56.919
 cameras 0 the keys but in this case he could see that he would still need to put 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.990
 mimic a little further back so that it is centered so 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.579
 there was a little camera and with the green axis 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.129
 he placed it more or less around here 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.089
 lie I have my object will initiate requires 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.150
 let's start by adding a light 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.169
 varas fazio dora at the amp 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.339
 this 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.999
 from here we will work with him to japan we will give him greater height and we 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.059
 we place in camera 7 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.449
 with the g key we're going to position our light here and we're going to 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.759
 Modify 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.529
 its orientation 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:31.839
 with the r key we are going to make him point to the monkey if we press twice 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.839
 let's unlock all the axes will be much easier points 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.779
 and the east more or less around here 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.129
 if you squeezed him twelve could see how he is creating a basic lighting 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.849
 anyway, if we look at the big ones, we do not realize that we have a 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.949
 shaded an aggressive base lighting as we have lost many 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.809
 details in this part here for lack of lighting 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:58.629
 let's try to solve this 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.629
 we are here and we are in camera 7 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.129
 The first thing I will do is duplicate 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.480
 alan so that we have selected you for it I will accept the combination of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.919
 keys 7 d 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.329
 ilave situate more or less around here 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.030
 with the r key I'm going to modify the orientation that points again to 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.909
 monkey 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.909
 with the jeter key itself move more or less around here 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.639
 ishihara preto is that it could not be seen what the improved lighting but in 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.620
 this case is very intense and as it is returning shadows that there was 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.460
 requested 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.460
 close here and let's see how we can solve this we select the plane 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.300
 with the right button and we press the key m 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.060
 here we indicate that we want the plane to be placed in a new layer 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.300
 ute 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.460
 we must activate this layer with the shift key so that it is visible 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.430
 if we hurt ourselves 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.000
 the lamp we are working with can be modified for example 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.880
 in the sip let's modify the intensity instead of one let's give it 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.210
 the value of 0 points 5 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.029
 in the same way we are going to activate the aie 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.749
 what this will do is that this illumination only assists the 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.199
 subjects that are in the same layer 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.699
 in this way that the plane will not be affected by the illumination of this 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.719
 lamp 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.649
 in the same way in shadows we will also work with the grass so that 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.620
 I have not created any shaded solvent 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.510
 out of the objects that are in this capacity squeezed twelve could 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.479
 to see how 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.880
 I have solved the p 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.979
 shading problem but I still 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.789
 having a somewhat more adequate lighting in this part here 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.899
 I could still modify and improve much more the lighting if 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.279
 injured the first one when protecting 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.729
 for working with the values ​​of is because I followed 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:43.759
 to greater value 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.659
 mayorga said true is that two could see how 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.650
 the lighting is much better distributed in the same way we are going to be able to 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.650
 modify the fade that seeks illumination 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.360
 to have things a greater fade of the cuts 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.930
 if we from here we are going to select the mind the lamp that 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.339
 we had doubled and we are going to duplicate with jokes 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.460
 already they place the behind the mosco 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.460
 from here I'm going to press the r key to modify the rotation 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:14.620
 I'll change 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.499
 the position of the camera 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.750
 I'm going to press twice r to be able 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.099
 Modify 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.520
 that the denomination is in the back dennis jett 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.969
 more or less strong 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.969
 still going to position is a little behind 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.409
 ishihara preto that 12 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.009
 I'll see what I got 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:40.259
 worked to better define the silhouette of the monkey so what difference does it make? 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.219
 more with what my plan would be 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:45.059
 from here and could not work smoothing 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:47.460
 Well, although the best shading 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.949
 who is creating the first lamp 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:52.499
 God willing, the first lamp was injured 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:55.819
 we can not build in samples the higher 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.819
 value le guen samples and htc 12 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.629
 better defined to the edge of my shadow in the same way if I work with 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:04.919
 tracks 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.560
 The higher the value 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.719
 more softened 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:12.579
 projecting this probe we can see how it is effectively softening me 

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.999
 very much 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:18.949
 if we also instead of working with a completely black shadow what 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:20.389
 let's do with a probe 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.389
 something more gray asia 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:27.759
 we can see that the cast is still much more suitable 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.180
 so from here on, so I'm inventing to try 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.150
 different voices different combinations as well as different intensities of 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.389
 between the lamps 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.969
 to get different types of lighting 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:42.399
 so far this tutorial thank you very much everyone for the tension and even the 

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:42.599
 next
