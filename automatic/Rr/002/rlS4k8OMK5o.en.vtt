strong banana smell and I was kind of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.200 
strong banana smell and I was kind of

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
wondering what the smoke was going to be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.340 
wondering what the smoke was going to be
like<00:01:45.420> based<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> smell<00:01:47.720> not<00:01:48.720> bad<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.229> let

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
like based on the smell not bad but let

00:01:49.350 --> 00:02:05.450 
like based on the smell not bad but let
me<00:01:49.380> let<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.710> let<00:01:49.740> me<00:01:50.009> try<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.280> here

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.270 

ok

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.870 

look<00:02:09.880> one<00:02:10.149> more

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.170 

okay<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.680> taste<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:22.110> has<00:02:22.520> some<00:02:23.520> banana

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
okay the taste of it it has some banana

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 
okay the taste of it it has some banana
taste<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.440> an<00:02:25.530> overly<00:02:25.800> strong

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
taste but it's not an overly strong

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.310 
taste but it's not an overly strong
banana<00:02:26.820> taste<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.270> it's<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.510> realistic<00:02:27.900> of

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
banana taste and it's more realistic of

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.620 
banana taste and it's more realistic of
a<00:02:28.440> banana<00:02:28.770> then<00:02:29.100> than<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> candy<00:02:30.060> banana<00:02:30.360> maybe

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
a banana then than a candy banana maybe

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
a banana then than a candy banana maybe
that's<00:02:30.810> what's<00:02:30.990> throwing<00:02:31.140> me<00:02:31.320> off<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> little

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that's what's throwing me off a little

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.020 
that's what's throwing me off a little
bit<00:02:31.800> because<00:02:32.070> some<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.460> other<00:02:32.610> bananas

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
bit because some of the other bananas

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.830 
bit because some of the other bananas
I've<00:02:33.180> had<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:34.260> had<00:02:34.290> more<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> candy<00:02:35.430> ish

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
I've had have had more of a candy ish

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.400 
I've had have had more of a candy ish
flavor<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.430> more<00:02:39.150> realistic<00:02:39.720> but

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
flavor to it this one more realistic but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.790 
flavor to it this one more realistic but
not<00:02:40.590> super<00:02:41.010> strong<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:42.240> scale<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.990> 1<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.260> 10<00:02:43.290> I

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
not super strong on scale of 1 to 10 I

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.610 
not super strong on scale of 1 to 10 I
would<00:02:44.670> give<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.420> 7<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.720> think

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
would give this a 7 just because I think

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.530 
would give this a 7 just because I think
I<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.190> more<00:02:50.370> candy<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:50.940> stronger

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
I like the more candy as stronger

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.860 
I like the more candy as stronger
tasting<00:02:52.200> bananas<00:02:52.710> but<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.460> like<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.720> bottom

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
tasting bananas but I do like the bottom

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.600 
tasting bananas but I do like the bottom
at<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.350> think<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> box<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:56.070> really<00:02:56.370> cool<00:02:56.550> i

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
at but I think the box is really cool i

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.670 
at but I think the box is really cool i
think<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> tobacco<00:02:57.360> itself<00:02:57.810> has<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.500> right

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
think the tobacco itself has the right

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.920 
think the tobacco itself has the right
consistency<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.700> i<00:03:00.060> imagine<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.540> will<00:03:00.630> smoke

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
consistency and i imagine it will smoke

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.410 
consistency and i imagine it will smoke
for<00:03:01.110> quite<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.320> long<00:03:01.380> time<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:02.340> you're<00:03:03.060> seeing

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
for quite a long time if you're seeing

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.830
