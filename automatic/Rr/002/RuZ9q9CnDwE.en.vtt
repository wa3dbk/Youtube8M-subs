climbing<00:00:22.410> i<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> only<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:23.039> they

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
climbing i think the only thing they

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.189 
climbing i think the only thing they
could<00:00:23.369> bring<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> down<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.630> weather<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
could bring it down is the weather and

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
could bring it down is the weather and
we<00:00:25.920> know<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.369> now<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.580> northeast<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
we know right now the northeast is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.689 
we know right now the northeast is
battling<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:28.590> snow<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.429> that's<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
battling with some snow so that's the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.540 
battling with some snow so that's the
only<00:00:29.840> reason<00:00:30.840> i'm<00:00:31.199> hesitant<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> say<00:00:32.160> wait

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
only reason i'm hesitant to say wait

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
only reason i'm hesitant to say wait

this<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> sound<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this is going to sound like it's a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
this is going to sound like it's a
contrarian<00:00:42.660> play<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> fade<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> public

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
contrarian play it's a fade the public

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.610 
contrarian play it's a fade the public
play<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.940> i'm<00:00:45.090> basing<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> fact<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
play but i'm basing it on the fact that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
play but i'm basing it on the fact that
the<00:00:46.800> lines<00:00:47.039> over<00:00:47.820> adjusted<00:00:48.420> from<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> first

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the lines over adjusted from the first

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.900 
the lines over adjusted from the first
time<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.320> met<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.160> met<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> first

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
time they met when they met the first

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
time they met when they met the first
time<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.270> September<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> remember<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
time in September you got to remember to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.770 
time in September you got to remember to
weather<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> lot<00:00:53.160> better<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:54.390> total<00:00:54.719> was

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
weather was a lot better the total was

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.529 
weather was a lot better the total was
48<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.100> sudden<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.550> 52<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.390> think

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
48 now all of a sudden is 52 and I think

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
48 now all of a sudden is 52 and I think
it's<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.870> even<00:00:58.140> higher<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.129> we

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it's going to go even higher so we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.590 
it's going to go even higher so we
should<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.640> looking<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.090> four<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.420> five

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
should be looking at a four or five

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
should be looking at a four or five
point<00:01:00.989> adjustment<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:02.190> granted<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:02.910> you

in September this here they scored 80
points<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.729> we're<00:01:14.850> looking<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
points but I think we're looking at a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.679 
points but I think we're looking at a
different<00:01:16.200> game<00:01:16.979> plan<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:18.030> New

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
different game plan this time around New

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.190 
different game plan this time around New
England's<00:01:19.080> coming<00:01:19.350> off<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> bye<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:21.420> don't

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
England's coming off a bye and I don't

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
England's coming off a bye and I don't
think<00:01:22.380> they're<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.909> as

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
think they're going to get it going as

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420 
think they're going to get it going as
quick<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.470> they<00:01:25.860> were<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.220> a

rhythm if it was just you know playing
last<00:01:29.070> week<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.759> here's<00:01:30.570> why<00:01:30.810> they're<00:01:31.680> 22<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
last week and here's why they're 22 and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
last week and here's why they're 22 and
two<00:01:32.790> against<00:01:33.450> Buffalo<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.170> home<00:01:34.530> how

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
two against Buffalo at home how

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.249 
two against Buffalo at home how
motivated<00:01:35.939> could<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.079> play

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
motivated could they really be to play

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
motivated could they really be to play
to<00:01:37.320> buffalo<00:01:37.770> bills<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> when<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.090> look<00:01:39.270> at

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to buffalo bills and when you look at

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.140 
to buffalo bills and when you look at
the<00:01:39.509> bills<00:01:39.750> defensively<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:41.430> give<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.729> six

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the bills defensively they give up six

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.870 
the bills defensively they give up six
yards<00:01:42.689> per<00:01:42.960> carry<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.710> think<00:01:44.610> we're<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
yards per carry I think we're going to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760 
yards per carry I think we're going to
see<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.360> rushing<00:01:45.930> from<00:01:46.079> New<00:01:46.290> England

buffalo<00:04:16.610> at<00:04:16.730> New<00:04:16.880> England<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.450> know<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.900> last

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
buffalo at New England I know the last

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.140 
buffalo at New England I know the last
three<00:04:18.380> times<00:04:18.650> these<00:04:18.860> teams<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.400> these<00:04:19.880> two

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
three times these teams to these two

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.660 
three times these teams to these two
teams<00:04:20.390> played<00:04:20.690> they've<00:04:21.470> been<00:04:21.950> scoring<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.640> lot

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
teams played they've been scoring a lot

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.670 
teams played they've been scoring a lot
of<00:04:22.940> points<00:04:23.300> but<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.780> think<00:04:24.230> we're<00:04:24.350> looking<00:04:24.470> at

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
of points but I think we're looking at

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.620 
of points but I think we're looking at
an<00:04:24.800> inflated<00:04:25.100> total<00:04:25.700> here<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.150> would<00:04:26.600> only

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
an inflated total here and would only

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.510 
an inflated total here and would only
one-quarter<00:04:27.350> good<00:04:27.740> quarterback<00:04:28.250> on<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
one-quarter good quarterback on the

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.880 
one-quarter good quarterback on the
field<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:29.210> think<00:04:29.780> we<00:04:29.900> got<00:04:29.930> we<00:04:30.260> got<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.560> lean<00:04:30.710> that

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
field I think we got we got to lean that

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.820 
field I think we got we got to lean that
he<00:04:30.980> under<00:04:31.250> here<00:04:31.490> line<00:04:32.090> should<00:04:32.420> go<00:04:32.660> up<00:04:32.870> Chris

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
he under here line should go up Chris

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.440 
he under here line should go up Chris
just<00:04:33.860> said<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.460> weather<00:04:34.670> is<00:04:34.790> expected<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.330> be

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
just said the weather is expected to be

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.990 
just said the weather is expected to be
clear<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.470> don't<00:04:36.740> think<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.190> public<00:04:37.730> is

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
clear so I don't think the public is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.810 
clear so I don't think the public is
going<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.360> slow<00:04:39.020> down<00:04:39.200> there<00:04:39.530> over<00:04:40.040> money<00:04:40.310> that

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
going to slow down there over money that

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.550 
going to slow down there over money that
should<00:04:41.090> drive<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.600> lineup<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.080> even<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.380> little

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
should drive the lineup I even a little

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.620 
should drive the lineup I even a little
bit<00:04:42.680> higher<00:04:43.010> I'm<00:04:43.640> going<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:43.970> go<00:04:44.060> under<00:04:44.420> here<00:04:44.570> I

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
bit higher I'm going to go under here I

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.120 
bit higher I'm going to go under here I
think<00:04:44.990> we're<00:04:45.080> going<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.260> see<00:04:45.290> Buffalo<00:04:45.500> run<00:04:45.980> the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
think we're going to see Buffalo run the

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.700 
think we're going to see Buffalo run the
ball<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.580> because<00:04:47.180> New<00:04:47.630> England<00:04:47.960> could<00:04:48.530> have

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
ball and because New England could have

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.290 
ball and because New England could have
a<00:04:48.740> lot<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.040> success<00:04:49.490> against<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.850> defense

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
a lot of success against the defense

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.160 
a lot of success against the defense
that<00:04:50.450> allows<00:04:50.780> six<00:04:51.530> yards<00:04:51.890> per<00:04:52.100> carry<00:04:53.170> both

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
that allows six yards per carry both

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.540 
that allows six yards per carry both
teams<00:04:54.470> might<00:04:54.680> be<00:04:54.830> running<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.220> ball<00:04:55.370> more

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
teams might be running the ball more

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.250 
teams might be running the ball more
than<00:04:55.760> you'd<00:04:55.970> expect<00:04:56.390> and<00:04:56.750> by<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.930> way<00:04:57.050> new

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
than you'd expect and by the way new
