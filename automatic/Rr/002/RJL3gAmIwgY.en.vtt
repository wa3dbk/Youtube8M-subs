 hello how about I'm ulises kings welcome 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.019
 to this new tutorial on this occasion 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.269
 I'm going to give you a brief introduction to 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.210
 sell a program for modeling and 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.730
 3d animation of excellent quality and what 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.619
 best of all, it's a program 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.779
 completely free in this video you 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.730
 I will show everything I need to start 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.829
 to use it giving you a little 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.079
 toured the interface and some of 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.640
 the tools that are offered so 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.499
 If you are about to enter the world of 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.149
 3d animation or if you're looking for a 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.699
 excellent free alternative to 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:36.250
 programs like 3d studio max mayer or 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.859
 cinema 4d probably this little 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 tutorial will be of help to you 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.480
 download it simply enter 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.920
 www.leer.org.ar a tivo 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.239
 blender is not very complicated 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.250
 If you have already had the experience of 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.230
 use a program like this 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.750
 You will see that its interface will be very 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.809
 otherwise familiar do not worry 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.949
 for that I made this tutorial 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.110
 first we have the bar 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.850
 information here is where you'll find the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.100
 main menu with options 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.960
 general blender as well as the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.270
 function of switching between different 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.460
 work spaces select the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.440
 scenes that we are going to create change the 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.030
 render engine besides showing 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.369
 also the information of the scene 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.440
 current right away we have the 3d view 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.479
 where precisely the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.030
 objects and everything that make up our 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.039
 scene in blender unlike others 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.869
 programs the objects are selected with 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.640
 the right click this is a 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.259
 feature that has its reasons 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.179
 but if you feel uncomfortable 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.030
 Fortunately you can change it from 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.159
 user preferences even if 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.050
 are you used to 3d studio max or 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.179
 maya blender gives you the option of 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.530
 select the appropriate settings for 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.260
 interact more comfortably 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.520
 returning to the 3d view and assuming 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.530
 which have not changed the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.990
 preferences if we click with the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.810
 left mouse button we will change the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.180
 cursor position 3 of this cursor 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.460
 has certain uses that will make it easier for you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.470
 be the modeling the animation but what 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.720
 At the beginning you will notice that it is useful for 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.380
 determine the position where they will be created 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.239
 the new objects on the left side 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.220
 we have the tool panel with the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.870
 necessary options that will affect the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.230
 objects that are selected within 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.930
 of the scene as duplicate erase and join 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.660
 objects switch to smoothed or flat mode 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.940
 insert animation keys among others 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.959
 to activate or deactivate this panel 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.400
 simply press the key 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.769
 additionally we also have the bar 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.870
 of properties of the 3d view that of 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.480
 Default form is hidden 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.510
 to show it we click on the icon 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.850
 more or just by pressing the n key 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.100
 Here are the properties that 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.380
 affect the 3d view as for example 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.390
 edit the transformation options of 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.210
 the selected objects in a way 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.690
 More specific 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.790
 in adjusting the cursor position 3 of 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.560
 rename objects and even show 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780
 images or background videos that we 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.790
 will help later as a reference 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.850
 for modeling objects and for 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.160
 add 3d elements to our videos 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.230
 in the lower part we have the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.630
 Main functions of the 3d view 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.640
 here you will find options how to change 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.840
 the view mode as the camera view 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.430
 the top front view and so on 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.650
 Selection options options 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.300
 objects change object mode 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.850
 selected in either edit mode 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.860
 to start modeling or mode 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.810
 sculpture where you will find the brushes 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.840
 corresponding to sculpt your model 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.240
 3d we also have the option to change 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.220
 The display mode options 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.350
 pivot point and controls 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.930
 transformation of objects how to move 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.970
 rotate and scale as well as the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.000
 options to switch between layers within 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.400
 of the scene among others 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.620
 in the upper right we have the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.450
 The listing panel here shows the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.820
 list of all the elements within 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.770
 the scene where you can select one or 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.810
 several elements at once as well as 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.810
 also hide those from the scene itself 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.760
 or the final render or also prevent 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.160
 can be selected within the view 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.290
 3d immediately we have the panel 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.329
 properties here is where it shows 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.820
 first the configuration of the render 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.160
 where you can change the resolution the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.140
 frame rate and select the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.270
 output folder and the format in which it 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.460
 will perform either in sequence 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.400
 images or directly in a format of 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.590
 video we also have the options of 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.720
 processing layers where you can 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.669
 select which layers or passes you want 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.730
 render for later 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.800
 combine them in composition are also 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.780
 the options of the scene where we can 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.450
 change the units of measure the 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.430
 interpretation of color and so on we have 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.080
 the environment options where we can 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.360
 enable options such as occlusion 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.070
 environmental or environmental lighting 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.500
 to increase the realism of the king of 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.990
 final is also the options 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.970
 of object here we can change the name 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.650
 selected object your options 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.230
 transformation or the layer that is 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.080
 located located we have also the 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.470
 option to add restrictions add 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.140
 the different types of modifiers 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.120
 handle object data creation 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.479
 materials and texture addition 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.990
 particle systems and the different 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.780
 simulation properties 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.240
 to navigate within the 3d view in 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.100
 sell the functions that are used are 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.860
 very similar to any other program 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.660
 3d to rotate the environment 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.280
 we hold the wheel of 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.390
 scroll of the mouse and what 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.340
 we drag 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.370
 in this way we will change the position 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.440
 display in the same way but 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.510
 holding the shift key 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.780
 we can move around our environment 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.340
 from side to side and to zoom in or 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.900
 zoom out 3d 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.300
 we simply turn the wheel 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.080
 Moving the mouse forward 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.449
 or back 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.819
 an easy way to use the options 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.430
 transformation is through the use of 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.219
 our keyboard for example to move 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.099
 an object quickly press the key 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:13.289
 g we drag the mouse and click 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.409
 to confirm the position or click 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.080
 right to cancel the operation 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:21.840
 also pressing the r key we can 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.750
 rotate our object and with the s key 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.969
 we will change its scale you will notice 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.280
 also that the distance of our 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.259
 cursor with the pivot point of the object 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.789
 will affect the intensity of the mode 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.120
 transformation that we are making 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.340
 for example when climbing if we move away 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.590
 our object cursor the amount of 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.629
 scale will be smaller instead if 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.030
 we approach the scale sufficiently 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.460
 will affect in greater quantity finally 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.500
 we have the timeline where 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.960
 will display the existing animation in 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.150
 our scene here we can establish 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.009
 the number of frames and indicate 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.229
 Where will the keys be added? 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.990
 animation for example let's animate 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.789
 quickly this cube the manual way of 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.080
 doing so is by going to the panel 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.360
 tools and do 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.389
 click on the option to insert frames 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.949
 key we selected the sixth option that 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.199
 will affect the three properties of 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:15.240
 transformation and we will see that the line of 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.370
 a yellow bar will appear 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.900
 indicating that in that time position 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.900
 there are keyframes 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.290
 if we want these frames to be 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.270
 add automatically simply 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.360
 we enable the insert option 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.360
 automatic 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.020
 well I think that as an introduction 

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:38.120
 this is the most basic thing that I can 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.919
 show you at the moment there are many 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.809
 things to learn but I hope that this 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:44.360
 tutorial will help you start using 

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:46.159
 this excellent program if you liked this 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.659
 tutorial please comment that you 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:50.059
 like to learn and do not forget 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:51.620
 share it with your friends thank you for 

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:53.860
