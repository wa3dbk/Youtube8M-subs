00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.039 
don't know why my computer does that but
it<00:01:14.130> says<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.880> always<00:01:15.090> comes<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.359> the<00:01:15.570> stupid

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
running through my phone here's my

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.030 
running through my phone here's my
channel<00:02:08.670> weird<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.770> does<00:02:12.340> seem<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.610> work

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
channel weird but it does seem to work

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.820 
channel weird but it does seem to work
let's<00:02:15.040> try

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
let's try

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.190 
let's try
under<00:02:17.460> my<00:02:17.580> hood

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
under my hood

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.650 
under my hood
so<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.730> little<00:02:20.879> bit<00:02:21.030> slower<00:02:21.330> than<00:02:21.480> normal

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
so it's a little bit slower than normal

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.410 
so it's a little bit slower than normal
because<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.319> wanting<00:02:22.590> through<00:02:22.739> USB<00:02:23.239> but<00:02:24.239> as

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
because it is wanting through USB but as

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.720 
because it is wanting through USB but as
you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.870> see<00:02:27.110> okay<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.590> proves<00:02:28.980> not<00:02:29.250> fake<00:02:29.519> or

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
you can see okay just proves not fake or

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.410 
you can see okay just proves not fake or
anything<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.150> course

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.740
