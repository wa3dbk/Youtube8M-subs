ability now to do file export selection
which<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> texture<00:00:28.650> file<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.220> now<00:00:29.640> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
which is the texture file and now you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.970 
which is the texture file and now you
will<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.689> PSD<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.949> of

export the screen size as we see it
right<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.760> double<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.359> or

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
right here or you can double it or

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.170 
right here or you can double it or
quadruple<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.799> important<00:01:05.189> part<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> this

quadruple and the important part is this
doubling<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.960> quadrupling<00:01:07.280> does<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.670> like

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

zooms in and re-render this tile and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
zooms in and re-render this tile and
then<00:01:21.659> recompile<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.470> back<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
photoshop and we're going to explore the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.700 
photoshop and we're going to explore the
outside<00:01:24.509> actually<00:01:25.020> make<00:01:25.200> sure<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.530> it's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
outside actually make sure that it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
outside actually make sure that it's
done<00:01:25.979> correctly<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.970> let's<00:01:27.240> export<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
done correctly so let's export this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
done correctly so let's export this
screen<00:01:28.290> size<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.310> once<00:01:29.490> i<00:01:29.579> hit<00:01:29.729> export

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
screen size as is and once i hit export

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
screen size as is and once i hit export
to<00:01:30.420> PSD<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> hourglass<00:01:32.250> start

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to PSD you will see the hourglass start

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.640 
to PSD you will see the hourglass start
to<00:01:32.640> spin<00:01:32.880> once<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> course<00:01:33.720> I'll<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.140> save<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to spin once of course I'll I save a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.890 
to spin once of course I'll I save a
file<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:35.939> doing<00:01:36.119> right<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.600> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
file and what it's doing right now it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
file and what it's doing right now it's
looking<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> program<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
looking for the program that is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.210 
looking for the program that is
associated<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> PSD<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.380> launching<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
associated with the PSD on launching it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
associated with the PSD on launching it
and<00:01:41.369> here's<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> foil<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.600> whatever

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and here's the foil so whatever

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.109 
and here's the foil so whatever
application<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:44.130> associated<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.820> PSD

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
application that associated with PSD

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.330 
application that associated with PSD
will<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.840> launched<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.470> computer<00:01:46.740> so

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
will be launched at your computer so

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.710 
will be launched at your computer so
let's<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.610> what's<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.479> let's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
let's see what's have we have here let's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.910 
let's see what's have we have here let's
go<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> way<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> log<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
go to all the way to log this is the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
go to all the way to log this is the
background<00:01:50.250> color<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> shader

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
background color now this is the shader

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
background color now this is the shader
the<00:01:51.990> base<00:01:52.200> geometry<00:01:52.890> base<00:01:53.220> color<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.210> top

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the base geometry base color and on top

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.950 
the base geometry base color and on top
of<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> enable<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> which<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> shader

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
of that enable that which is the shader

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.350 
of that enable that which is the shader
information<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.619> spec<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> gloss<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
information like the spec and gloss and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.209 
information like the spec and gloss and
then<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.960> two<00:02:01.110> layers<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:02.040> is

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
then you have two layers here one is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.889 
then you have two layers here one is
locked<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.149> actually<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.780> are

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
locked that actually all of them are

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.770 
locked that actually all of them are
locked<00:02:04.140> except<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.149> open

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
from PSD and I choose my fault but a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.510 
from PSD and I choose my fault but a
matter<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.740> fact<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.190> want<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.370> show<00:02:24.460> you

matter of fact I just want to show you

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.740 
matter of fact I just want to show you
something<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.910> actually<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.330> way<00:02:25.450> cooler

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
something is actually it's way cooler

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.500 
something is actually it's way cooler
than<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.740> even<00:02:26.950> rotate<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.640> camera<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.150> now

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
than if I even rotate the camera and now

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.690 
than if I even rotate the camera and now
I'm<00:02:28.690> totally<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.470> different<00:02:29.500> position<00:02:29.950> it's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
I'm totally in a different position it's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.430 
I'm totally in a different position it's
not<00:02:30.880> like<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.180> reproject<00:02:31.540> thing<00:02:32.050> again

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
not like it's reproject thing again

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.240 
not like it's reproject thing again
matter<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.130> fact<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:34.840> I'm<00:02:35.020> do<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.470> it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
matter of fact if I'm do this it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.920 
matter of fact if I'm do this it
automatically<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.300> first<00:02:37.480> thing<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.750> did

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
automatically the first thing it did

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.750 
automatically the first thing it did
it's<00:02:38.380> aligned<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.950> camera<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.400> original

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
it's aligned the camera to the original

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.670 
it's aligned the camera to the original
position<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.209> now<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:40.810> bringing<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.260> PSD

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
position and now it's bringing the PSD

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.210 
position and now it's bringing the PSD
and<00:02:41.890> here<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.310> is

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
and here it is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.560 
and here it is
so<00:02:45.220> as<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.460> can<00:02:45.610> see<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:45.940> can<00:02:46.150> be<00:02:46.300> very

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
so as you can see this can be very

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.470 
so as you can see this can be very
powerful<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.130> go<00:02:48.310> back<00:02:48.520> let's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
powerful because you can go back let's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.030 
powerful because you can go back let's
say<00:02:49.600> go<00:02:49.780> back<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.140> photoshop<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:52.530> use<00:02:53.530> any<00:02:53.890> of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
say go back and photoshop and use any of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.770 
say go back and photoshop and use any of
the<00:02:54.250> photoshop<00:02:54.700> manipulation<00:02:55.300> tools<00:02:55.540> like

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the photoshop manipulation tools like

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.990 
the photoshop manipulation tools like
blur<00:02:56.080> for<00:02:56.320> example<00:02:56.800> leave<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.550> option<00:02:57.760> is

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
blur for example leave this option is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.550 
blur for example leave this option is
not<00:02:58.030> available<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.690> Mudbox<00:02:59.080> which<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.410> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
not available in Mudbox which is the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.140 
not available in Mudbox which is the
blur<00:02:59.740> tool<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.430> I'm<00:03:00.520> just<00:03:00.730> blurring<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
blur tool here so I'm just blurring the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.050 
blur tool here so I'm just blurring the
pixels<00:03:01.600> or<00:03:01.750> even<00:03:02.500> doing<00:03:02.830> more<00:03:03.610> here<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.850> can

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
pixels or even doing more here I can

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.910 
pixels or even doing more here I can
just<00:03:04.240> select<00:03:04.360> an<00:03:04.660> area<00:03:04.870> here<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> all<00:03:08.770> these

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
just select an area here so all these

fingertips<00:03:25.910> with<00:03:26.570> one<00:03:26.720> box<00:03:26.960> so<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:27.770> is<00:03:27.800> very

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
fingertips with one box so this is very

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.350 
fingertips with one box so this is very
interesting<00:03:28.340> now<00:03:28.640> let's<00:03:28.850> go<00:03:28.940> back<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
interesting now let's go back to the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.520 
interesting now let's go back to the
screen<00:03:29.600> size<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.960> we<00:03:30.080> talked<00:03:30.290> about<00:03:30.380> earlier

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
screen size that we talked about earlier

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.410 
screen size that we talked about earlier
we<00:03:31.070> have<00:03:31.220> this<00:03:31.370> image<00:03:31.790> which<00:03:32.270> is<00:03:33.880> 1035<00:03:34.880> so

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
we have this image which is 1035 so

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.520 
we have this image which is 1035 so
let's<00:03:35.690> multiply<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:36.230> by<00:03:36.290> 2<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:39.170> i'm<00:03:39.350> just

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
let's multiply that by 2 and i'm just

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.430 
let's multiply that by 2 and i'm just
going<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.770> do<00:03:40.090> actual<00:03:41.090> size<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.110> see

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
going to do actual size and you can see

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.070 
going to do actual size and you can see
here<00:03:42.710> there's<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.390> pixelated<00:03:44.390> area<00:03:44.660> because<00:03:44.930> we

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
here there's a pixelated area because we

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.020 
here there's a pixelated area because we
doubled<00:03:45.650> size<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.130> image<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:46.700> let's<00:03:46.880> go<00:03:47.000> back

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
doubled size the image but let's go back

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.780 
doubled size the image but let's go back
to<00:03:47.210> my<00:03:47.330> box<00:03:48.070> actually<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.220> best<00:03:49.310> thing<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.670> do

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
to my box actually the best thing to do

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.920 
to my box actually the best thing to do
and<00:03:49.910> make<00:03:50.030> sure<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.360> we<00:03:50.480> get<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:50.750> at<00:03:50.900> the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
and make sure that we get it at the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.270 
and make sure that we get it at the
right<00:03:51.020> angle<00:03:51.200> i'm<00:03:51.650> going<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:51.860> reinforce<00:03:52.190> the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
right angle i'm going to reinforce the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.730 
right angle i'm going to reinforce the
PSD<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.880> align<00:03:53.510> my<00:03:53.690> object<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.170> here<00:03:54.320> this<00:03:54.470> end

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
PSD to align my object in here this end

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.660 
PSD to align my object in here this end
up<00:03:55.580> going<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.880> do<00:03:59.710> here's<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.860> file<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.430> as

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
up going to do here's the file and as

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.220 
up going to do here's the file and as
you<00:04:01.790> can<00:04:01.970> see<00:04:02.000> now<00:04:02.420> if<00:04:02.600> we<00:04:02.720> can<00:04:02.870> go<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.110> the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
you can see now if we can go to the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.500 
you can see now if we can go to the
image<00:04:03.500> size<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:04.370> already<00:04:04.610> been<00:04:04.760> doubled<00:04:05.090> but

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
image size it's already been doubled but

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.040 
image size it's already been doubled but
i'm<00:04:05.630> just<00:04:05.840> going<00:04:05.960> to<00:04:05.990> do<00:04:06.140> actual<00:04:07.330> pixel<00:04:08.330> and

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
i'm just going to do actual pixel and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.280 
i'm just going to do actual pixel and
let<00:04:09.260> me<00:04:09.410> try<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.680> get<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.010> same<00:04:10.160> angle<00:04:10.580> here<00:04:10.820> as

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
let me try to get the same angle here as

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.680 
let me try to get the same angle here as
you<00:04:12.290> can<00:04:12.320> see<00:04:12.820> totally<00:04:13.820> different<00:04:14.270> quality

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
you can see totally different quality

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.380 
you can see totally different quality
you<00:04:15.260> can<00:04:15.440> see<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.580> pixelated<00:04:17.060> and

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
you can see this is so pixelated and

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.110 
you can see this is so pixelated and
this<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.720> dot<00:04:17.959> again<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.190> what<00:04:19.340> modbox<00:04:19.700> does<00:04:19.940> it

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
this is dot again so what modbox does it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.850 
this is dot again so what modbox does it
actually<00:04:20.330> creates<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.049> camera<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.560> zooms

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
actually creates the camera and zooms

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.160 
actually creates the camera and zooms
and<00:04:22.040> render<00:04:22.460> it<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.760> bring<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.570> bring<00:04:24.020> you

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
and render it and bring so bring you

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.230 
and render it and bring so bring you
these<00:04:24.290> tiles<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.920> then<00:04:25.040> on<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.520> flying<00:04:25.820> bring

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
these tiles and then on the flying bring

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.880 
these tiles and then on the flying bring
align<00:04:26.720> them<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:26.990> photoshop<00:04:27.170> and<00:04:27.590> bring<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.860> to

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
align them in photoshop and bring it to

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.560 
align them in photoshop and bring it to
you<00:04:27.980> as<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.130> texture<00:04:28.460> file<00:04:28.640> powerful<00:04:29.360> feature

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
you as a texture file powerful feature

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.900 
you as a texture file powerful feature
in<00:04:29.870> my<00:04:30.020> opinion<00:04:30.320> at<00:04:30.530> least<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.610> opens

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
in my opinion at least that it opens

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.110 
in my opinion at least that it opens
lots<00:04:32.150> of<00:04:32.270> opportunity<00:04:32.810> for<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:34.550> if<00:04:34.760> we<00:04:34.910> say

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
lots of opportunity for you so if we say

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.700 
lots of opportunity for you so if we say
let's<00:04:35.390> go<00:04:35.540> look<00:04:35.690> at<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.870> texture<00:04:36.470> paint

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
let's go look at the texture paint

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.860 
let's go look at the texture paint
itself<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.160> do<00:04:37.250> export<00:04:37.670> selection<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.750> we

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
itself and do export selection and we

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.110 
itself and do export selection and we
export<00:04:39.170> that<00:04:39.200> file<00:04:39.560> as<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.800> PSD<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.850> then<00:04:41.000> call

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
export that file as a PSD and then call

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.830 
export that file as a PSD and then call
a<00:04:41.150> color<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:43.730> now<00:04:43.820> i<00:04:43.850> can<00:04:44.150> jump<00:04:44.330> back<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.630> my

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
a color and now i can jump back to my

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.750 
a color and now i can jump back to my
photoshop<00:04:45.350> just<00:04:45.800> underneath<00:04:46.100> these<00:04:46.340> animals

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
photoshop just underneath these animals

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.570 
photoshop just underneath these animals
i'm<00:04:46.940> just<00:04:47.090> going<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.240> close<00:04:47.420> them<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:48.580> i'm

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
i'm just going to close them and i'm

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.940 
i'm just going to close them and i'm
gonna<00:04:49.760> do<00:04:50.000> here<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.110> here's<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.740> interesting

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
gonna do here and here's the interesting

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.820 
gonna do here and here's the interesting
part<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.760> will<00:04:52.880> get<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.270> texture<00:04:53.540> file<00:04:53.840> and

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
part you will get the texture file and

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.810 
part you will get the texture file and
on<00:04:55.010> top<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:56.330> will<00:04:56.510> get<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.350> UV<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:58.460> if

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
on top of that you will get the UV so if

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.210 
on top of that you will get the UV so if
you<00:04:58.940> have<00:04:59.150> any<00:04:59.900> file<00:05:00.350> that<00:05:00.590> comes<00:05:00.830> in<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.160> you

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
you have any file that comes in and you

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.400 
you have any file that comes in and you
want<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.460> figure<00:05:01.700> it<00:05:01.910> out<00:05:01.970> where<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.390> that<00:05:02.570> part

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
want to figure it out where is that part

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.440 
want to figure it out where is that part
on<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.830> mesh<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.430> can<00:05:04.640> have<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.000> here<00:05:05.270> as<00:05:05.420> a

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
on the mesh you can have that here as a

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.480 
on the mesh you can have that here as a
as<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:06.020> quick<00:05:06.350> identifier<00:05:06.980> for<00:05:07.250> you<00:05:07.370> it's

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
as a quick identifier for you it's

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.190 
as a quick identifier for you it's
really<00:05:07.760> really<00:05:08.000> interesting<00:05:08.180> so<00:05:08.810> i<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:09.020> just

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
really really interesting so i can just

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.060 
really really interesting so i can just
come<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.440> here<00:05:09.470> maybe<00:05:10.460> retouch<00:05:10.910> on<00:05:11.090> my<00:05:11.240> paint

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
come in here maybe retouch on my paint
