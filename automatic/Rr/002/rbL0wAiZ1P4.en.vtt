00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
have noticed that the faith is is

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.960 
have noticed that the faith is is
attenuated<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.560> diminishing<00:02:32.070> mass

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
attenuated it's diminishing mass

to Christianity in Europe a lot of
different<00:02:55.770> theories<00:02:56.300> one<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.450> especially<00:02:57.690> in

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
different theories one is especially in

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.380 
different theories one is especially in
France<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.620> long<00:02:59.280> association<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.240> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
France that long association of the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.510 
France that long association of the
church<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.200> they<00:03:01.860> call<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> ancien

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
church with the they call the ancien

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.020 
church with the they call the ancien
régime<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.959> power<00:03:04.830> structure<00:03:05.430> economic

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
régime with the power structure economic

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.120 
régime with the power structure economic
and<00:03:06.180> political<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> there<00:03:07.800> was<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.920> reaction

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
and political so there was a reaction

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.190 
and political so there was a reaction
against<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.270> church<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.690> seen<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.990> on<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
against it the church was seen is on the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.830 
against it the church was seen is on the
side<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.709> rich<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.010> powerful

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
side of the rich and powerful

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.699 
side of the rich and powerful
indifferent<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.990> struggles<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.500> poor

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
indifferent to the struggles of the poor

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.380 
indifferent to the struggles of the poor
and<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.070> there's<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.400> animosity<00:03:14.790> which<00:03:15.240> is

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
and so there's this animosity which is

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.150 
and so there's this animosity which is
still<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.990> think<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.890> French

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
still I think in the French

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.490 
still I think in the French
consciousness<00:03:18.030> other<00:03:18.900> people<00:03:19.170> point<00:03:19.410> out

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
consciousness other people point out

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
consciousness other people point out
that<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.160> great<00:03:20.370> atheist<00:03:20.850> go<00:03:21.030> back<00:03:21.209> to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
that the great atheist go back to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.290 
that the great atheist go back to

through the educational system and now
it<00:03:34.320> might<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.830> sort<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.100> general<00:03:35.580> consensus

the faith claims one that I would add is

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.890 
the faith claims one that I would add is
in<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.830> orgy<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.430> violence<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.330> Europe<00:03:51.690> went

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
in the orgy of violence that Europe went

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.150 
in the orgy of violence that Europe went
through<00:03:52.110> in<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.320> 20th<00:03:52.680> century

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
through in the 20th century

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.190 
through in the 20th century
here's<00:03:53.700> largely<00:03:54.180> Christian<00:03:54.690> Europe<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.140> it

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
here's largely Christian Europe and it

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.370 
here's largely Christian Europe and it
goes<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.470> two<00:03:55.860> world<00:03:56.100> wars<00:03:56.209> -<00:03:57.380> mostly

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
goes to two world wars - mostly

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.979 
goes to two world wars - mostly
successful<00:03:58.920> attempts<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.430> genocide<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.239> I

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
successful attempts of genocide and I

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.690 
successful attempts of genocide and I
think<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.260> broke<00:04:01.560> something<00:04:02.070> in<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.280> European

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
think it broke something in the European

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.520 
think it broke something in the European
spirit<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.209> think<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.570> can't<00:04:03.870> endure<00:04:04.260> that

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
spirit I think you can't endure that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.039 
spirit I think you can't endure that
kind<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:05.010> violence<00:04:05.519> without<00:04:06.180> something<00:04:06.570> going

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
kind of violence without something going

wrong<00:04:07.100> with<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.280> spirit<00:04:09.000> but<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:09.930> whatever

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
wrong with the spirit but for whatever

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.780 
wrong with the spirit but for whatever
reason<00:04:10.230> maybe<00:04:10.620> all<00:04:10.860> those<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.340> many<00:04:11.459> others

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790

and<00:06:03.810> now<00:06:03.990> as<00:06:04.229> I've<00:06:04.380> suggested<00:06:04.560> at<00:06:04.919> least<00:06:05.070> in

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
and now as I've suggested at least in

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.040 
and now as I've suggested at least in
Europe<00:06:05.340> it's<00:06:05.909> different<00:06:06.270> around<00:06:06.419> other<00:06:06.870> parts

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
Europe it's different around other parts

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.020 
Europe it's different around other parts
of<00:06:07.199> the<00:06:07.289> world<00:06:07.409> but<00:06:07.680> in<00:06:07.830> Europe<00:06:08.220> it's<00:06:08.699> met<00:06:09.000> with

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
of the world but in Europe it's met with

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.300 
of the world but in Europe it's met with
this<00:06:09.240> kind<00:06:09.509> of<00:06:09.599> yawn<00:06:10.259> of<00:06:10.590> bored<00:06:11.130> and

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
this kind of yawn of bored and

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.439 
this kind of yawn of bored and
difference<00:06:11.750> okay<00:06:12.750> so<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.710> goes<00:06:14.300> when<00:06:15.300> the

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
difference okay so it goes when the

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.360 
difference okay so it goes when the
church<00:06:15.720> can<00:06:16.199> influence<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.830> culture<00:06:17.190> it

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
church can influence the culture it

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.210 
church can influence the culture it
should<00:06:17.810> when<00:06:18.810> it<00:06:18.900> can<00:06:19.229> shape<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:19.710> culture<00:06:19.919> it

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
should when it can shape the culture it

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.430 
should when it can shape the culture it
should<00:06:20.460> try<00:06:20.669> it<00:06:20.729> should<00:06:21.030> do<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:21.330> when<00:06:22.199> it<00:06:22.289> has

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
should try it should do it when it has
