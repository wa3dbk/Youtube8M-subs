00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.540
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.340
 go nickel 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.360
 new information video so no 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.900
 on gta may 5th about my channel 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.760
 Youtube 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.860
 so I could see in my posts on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.449
 my facebook page that some people 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.289
 often asked me when will be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 the next video 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.380
 so I answer them tonight or 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.000
 soon and why 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.199
 and they do not answer me because that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.980
 for a moment that you do not have 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 released videos 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.250
 so I thought it's a bit 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.559
 weird usually I'm trying to get out 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.899
 at least one video a day 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.559
 that this is an information a mode where 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.210
 a race 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.040
 so I thought it was a little weird and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.420
 in fact it's youtube bug and when 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 I'm going out a video everyone does not 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.170
 not necessarily receive a notification and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 that's what must have happened with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 These persons 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.340
 So I invite you to do a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.079
 little manipulation on youtube for those who 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.059
 want and that will allow you to 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.610
 to receive a notification to each of 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 my activities on youtube 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.700
 so it's very simple look there we get 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.619
 makes on my channel youtube bikes again 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.450
 official here next to the subscribers box 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.979
 we have a small wheel you click 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.330
 above and there you tick the box 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.850
 send me all the notifications 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.160
 relating to this string so you 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.660
 you check and record as 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.459
 that normally you will not have to have 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.350
 this problem and you will not miss it anymore 

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.580
 no video 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.990
 and so I hope I could have 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.910
 respond to people who had asked 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.530
 the same kind of question and that this 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.300
 little option we will say will help you by 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.590
 the following 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.819
 and so that's me I wanted it's on 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.050

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.789
 little information video 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.649
