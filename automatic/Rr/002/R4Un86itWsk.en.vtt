in this video we're going to very
quickly<00:00:01.530> look<00:00:01.890> at<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> couple<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.399> tips<00:00:02.580> to

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
quickly look at a couple of tips to

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.730 
quickly look at a couple of tips to
clear<00:00:03.120> space<00:00:03.330> off<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.990> your<00:00:04.080> hard<00:00:04.350> drive<00:00:04.589> if

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
clear space off of your hard drive if

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.710 
clear space off of your hard drive if
you're<00:00:04.859> running<00:00:05.069> out<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> space<00:00:05.879> so<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.210> am<00:00:06.540> in

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
you're running out of space so I am in

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.660 
you're running out of space so I am in
finder<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.470> I've<00:00:07.649> chosen<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.160> Macintosh

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
finder and I've chosen the Macintosh

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.129 
finder and I've chosen the Macintosh
hard<00:00:09.059> drive<00:00:09.330> right<00:00:09.540> here<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.870> you'll<00:00:09.960> see

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
hard drive right here and you'll see

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.530 
hard drive right here and you'll see
that<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.349> have<00:00:10.380> five<00:00:10.650> primary<00:00:11.010> folders<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.759> my

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
that I have five primary folders on my

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.999 
that I have five primary folders on my
hard<00:00:12.809> drive<00:00:12.870> I'll<00:00:13.290> also<00:00:13.469> notice<00:00:13.830> down<00:00:13.950> here

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
hard drive I'll also notice down here

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.560 
hard drive I'll also notice down here
that<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.549> ninety<00:00:15.089> five<00:00:15.240> gig

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that I have about ninety five gig

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.880 
that I have about ninety five gig
available<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.560> don't<00:00:16.619> need<00:00:16.770> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
available so I really don't need to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.380 
available so I really don't need to
clear<00:00:17.100> space<00:00:17.250> off<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:17.820> if<00:00:17.880> you're<00:00:18.000> running

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
clear space off but if you're running

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.450 
clear space off but if you're running
out<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> space<00:00:18.930> here's<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> need<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> do

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
out of space here's what you need to do

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
out of space here's what you need to do
first<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:21.270> you'll<00:00:21.449> notice<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.869> have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
first of all you'll notice that I have

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.509 
first of all you'll notice that I have
the<00:00:22.140> size<00:00:22.350> column<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the size column here this is going to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.099 
the size column here this is going to
help<00:00:23.699> because<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.029> tells<00:00:24.269> me<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.660> folders

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
help because this tells me what folders

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109 
help because this tells me what folders
are<00:00:25.260> taking<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> most<00:00:26.070> space<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.760> then

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
are taking up the most space and then

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.820 
are taking up the most space and then
also<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.599> able<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> sort<00:00:28.439> by<00:00:28.650> that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
also what I'm able to do is sort by that

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.859 
also what I'm able to do is sort by that
folder<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.609> i<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.029> some<00:00:30.269> applications

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
folder so i can see some applications

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
folder so i can see some applications
and<00:00:31.080> library<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.590> system<00:00:31.890> folders<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.279> i

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and library and system folders here i

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.530 
and library and system folders here i
probably<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:32.910> want<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.329> mess

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
probably don't want to really mess

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.150 
probably don't want to really mess
around<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.899> those<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.680> unless<00:00:35.010> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
around on those if I know what unless I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
around on those if I know what unless I
really<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:35.610> doing<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.570> go

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
really know what I'm doing but if I go

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.090 
really know what I'm doing but if I go
into<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> users<00:00:37.290> folder<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
into the users folder here I'm going to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.830 
into the users folder here I'm going to
see<00:00:38.250> my<00:00:38.430> different<00:00:39.059> users<00:00:39.360> including<00:00:39.660> my

now<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.110> sort<00:00:43.559> by<00:00:43.890> size<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.149> within

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
now if I sort by size I can see within

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
now if I sort by size I can see within
this<00:00:46.110> area<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> different<00:00:47.550> folders<00:00:47.940> my

calculating<00:01:24.119> sizes<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.750> will<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:25.020> ahead<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
calculating sizes that will go ahead and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.830 
calculating sizes that will go ahead and
unclog<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.340> calculate<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> rest<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
unclog it and calculate the rest of the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
unclog it and calculate the rest of the
sizes<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.680> you'll<00:01:28.860> also<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> size<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
sizes but you'll also see the size of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.940 
sizes but you'll also see the size of
the<00:01:29.970> folder<00:01:30.329> right<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> know

the folder right here so now I know

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.520 
the folder right here so now I know
where<00:01:32.610> most<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.180> space<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> being<00:01:34.079> taken<00:01:34.320> up

where most of my space is being taken up

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
where most of my space is being taken up
it's<00:01:34.740> being<00:01:34.950> taken<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.340> again<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.759> music

events again sorted by size and now I

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
events again sorted by size and now I
see<00:02:01.530> those<00:02:01.680> events<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.250> taking<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
see those events that are taking up the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.730 
see those events that are taking up the
majority<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.299> space<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.170> these<00:02:04.409> two

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
majority of the space so these two

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
majority of the space so these two
events<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.790> example<00:02:05.850> both<00:02:06.360> those<00:02:06.899> are

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
events I know for example both those are

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.479 
events I know for example both those are
my<00:02:07.140> two<00:02:07.200> daughters<00:02:07.469> Lauren<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.009> Brooke<00:02:08.190> I'm

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
my two daughters Lauren and Brooke I'm

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.309 
my two daughters Lauren and Brooke I'm
really<00:02:08.849> done<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.360> those<00:02:09.569> two<00:02:09.810> folders<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
really done with those two folders and

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
really done with those two folders and
those<00:02:10.440> events<00:02:10.739> I've<00:02:10.920> made<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> movies<00:02:11.700> I

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
those events I've made the movies I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.910 
those events I've made the movies I
wanted<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> make<00:02:12.300> off<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.599> their<00:02:12.900> baby<00:02:13.140> movies

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
wanted to make off of their baby movies

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.860 
wanted to make off of their baby movies
and<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.520> could<00:02:14.700> take<00:02:14.910> these<00:02:15.120> events<00:02:15.480> now<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.840> I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and I could take these events now and I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
and I could take these events now and I
can<00:02:15.990> move<00:02:16.200> them<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> an<00:02:16.680> external<00:02:16.950> hard<00:02:17.160> drive

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
can move them to an external hard drive

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.250 
can move them to an external hard drive
and<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.849> right<00:02:18.569> there<00:02:18.599> would<00:02:18.959> very<00:02:19.200> quickly

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and that right there would very quickly

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.740 
and that right there would very quickly
free<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.130> 11<00:02:20.640> gigabytes<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.209> space<00:02:21.390> for

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
free up about 11 gigabytes of space for

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.300 
free up about 11 gigabytes of space for
me<00:02:21.900> again<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.440> don't<00:02:22.500> really<00:02:22.709> need<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.980> do<00:02:23.130> that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
me again I don't really need to do that

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.790 
me again I don't really need to do that
now<00:02:23.459> but<00:02:23.910> that's<00:02:24.090> how<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.450> go<00:02:24.870> into<00:02:25.200> finder

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
now but that's how you go into finder

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.650 
now but that's how you go into finder
and<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.340> locate<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.180> you're<00:02:27.300> running<00:02:27.420> out

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and kind of locate if you're running out

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.420 
and kind of locate if you're running out
of<00:02:27.720> space<00:02:27.989> where<00:02:28.230> your<00:02:28.410> big<00:02:28.590> chunks<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.160> files

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
of space where your big chunks of files

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.010 
of space where your big chunks of files
are<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.330> course<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.660> delete

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
are and then of course you delete

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.780 
are and then of course you delete
something<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.800> click<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.550> hit

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
something you just click on it and hit

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.150 
something you just click on it and hit
command<00:02:33.390> delete<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.319> will<00:02:34.590> send<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.980> down<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
command delete that will send it down to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.890 
command delete that will send it down to
the<00:02:35.430> trash<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.180> need<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.510> go<00:02:36.630> into

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the trash and then you need to go into

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.840 
the trash and then you need to go into
the<00:02:37.230> trash<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.709> won't<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.130> anything<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.670> here

the trash I won't have anything in here

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.360 
the trash I won't have anything in here
but<00:02:39.330> then<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.019> empty<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.650> trash<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.220> get

but then go and empty the trash to get

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.339 
but then go and empty the trash to get
it<00:02:41.459> completely<00:02:41.550> off<00:02:42.030> your<00:02:42.060> Mac<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.540> free<00:02:43.230> up
