00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
and when you rotate this that's Phi 1

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.750 
and when you rotate this that's Phi 1
maybe<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.930> miss<00:00:59.930> Houska<00:01:00.230> where<00:01:00.760> there's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.230 

these<00:01:17.210> rotate<00:01:18.160> so<00:01:19.160> obviously<00:01:19.490> when<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.760> lands

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
these rotate so obviously when it lands

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.460 
these rotate so obviously when it lands
and<00:01:20.420> takes<00:01:20.930> off<00:01:25.360> cockpit<00:01:26.360> opens<00:01:26.720> up<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.380> you

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
and takes off cockpit opens up so you

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.560 
and takes off cockpit opens up so you
can<00:01:27.680> stick<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.220> think<00:01:28.550> it<00:01:28.610> was<00:01:28.730> free<00:01:29.120> people<00:01:29.540> in
