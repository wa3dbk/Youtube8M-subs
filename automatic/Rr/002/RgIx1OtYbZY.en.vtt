00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
pattern is not affected and that's it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.910 
pattern is not affected and that's it
okay<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> injectors<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> flow

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
okay here the injectors are on the flow

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.490 
okay here the injectors are on the flow
bench<00:00:35.160> I'm<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> run<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.500> six

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
bench I'm going to run these at six

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.979 
bench I'm going to run these at six
millisecond<00:00:39.140> pulse<00:00:40.140> width<00:00:41.540> for<00:00:42.540> probably<00:00:42.780> 10

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
millisecond pulse width for probably 10

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.229 
millisecond pulse width for probably 10
seconds<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.890> give<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:44.190> idea<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
seconds just to give you an idea of the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:59.890 
seconds just to give you an idea of the
spray<00:00:45.480> pattern

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.270 

okay<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:01.110> gives<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.380> an<00:01:01.470> idea<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:02.010> what

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
okay that gives you an idea that what

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.370 
okay that gives you an idea that what
I'm<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.490> to<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.610> now<00:01:02.790> is<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.350> on

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
I'm going to do now is put them down on

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.080 
I'm going to do now is put them down on
the<00:01:04.620> tube<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.130> we<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.370> measure<00:01:05.580> them<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.030> we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the tube so we can measure them what we

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
the tube so we can measure them what we
can<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:06.690> five<00:01:07.020> second<00:01:07.500> run<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:08.040> static

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
can do is do a five second run at static

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
can do is do a five second run at static
and<00:01:09.210> give<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> measurement<00:01:10.620> and<00:01:10.950> then

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and give you a measurement and then

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.240 
and give you a measurement and then
we'll<00:01:11.460> modify<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.320> put<00:01:13.500> four<00:01:13.740> side<00:01:14.070> by

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
we'll modify for and put four side by

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.570 
we'll modify for and put four side by
side<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.420> show<00:01:15.660> you<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.900> difference<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
side and show you the difference and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.760 
side and show you the difference and
show<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> what<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> results<00:01:18.300> are<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.870> 32s

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
show you what the results are of the 32s

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.300 
show you what the results are of the 32s
that<00:01:19.950> become<00:01:20.250> 50<00:01:20.550> tues<00:01:20.760> ok<00:01:22.010> ok<00:01:23.010> here<00:01:23.160> we<00:01:23.220> go

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that become 50 tues ok ok here we go

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.610 
that become 50 tues ok ok here we go
we're<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.120> at<00:01:24.330> four<00:01:24.570> bar<00:01:24.840> we're

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
we're going to do this at four bar we're

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.290 
we're going to do this at four bar we're
going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> five<00:01:26.220> second<00:01:26.730> run<00:01:26.910> at<00:01:27.090> full

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
going to do a five second run at full

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.960 
going to do a five second run at full
static<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.050> then<00:01:28.530> we'll<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.550> math<00:01:29.730> real

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
static and then we'll do the math real

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.770 
static and then we'll do the math real
quick

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.430 

okay<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.160> they<00:01:41.160> float<00:01:41.460> 30<00:01:41.790> CC's<00:01:42.330> 45<00:01:42.870> seconds

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
okay they they float 30 CC's 45 seconds

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.920 
okay they they float 30 CC's 45 seconds
so<00:01:43.620> they<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> minute<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.180> take<00:01:45.300> 30<00:01:45.570> x

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so they get a minute we would take 30 x

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.060 
so they get a minute we would take 30 x
12<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> 360<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.090> means<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.600> flowed<00:01:49.070> 360

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
12 which is 360 it means they flowed 360

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.120 
12 which is 360 it means they flowed 360
cc's<00:01:50.940> per<00:01:50.970> minute<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.350> formula<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.950> get

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
cc's per minute and the formula to get

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.590 
cc's per minute and the formula to get
pounds<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.180> use<00:01:54.380> 10.4<00:01:55.380> divided<00:01:56.010> into<00:01:56.280> that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
pounds we use 10.4 divided into that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
pounds we use 10.4 divided into that
number<00:01:57.600> which<00:01:57.990> 360<00:01:58.950> /<00:01:59.370> 10.4<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.510> 30<00:02:00.870> 4.6<00:02:01.830> pounds

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
number which 360 / 10.4 is 30 4.6 pounds

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.900 
number which 360 / 10.4 is 30 4.6 pounds
so<00:02:02.970> that's<00:02:03.150> what<00:02:03.330> these<00:02:03.480> flowed<00:02:04.670> right<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.880> of

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
so that's what these flowed right out of

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.330 
so that's what these flowed right out of
the<00:02:06.090> car<00:02:06.330> what<00:02:07.080> I'm<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.440> now<00:02:07.620> is<00:02:07.920> go

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the car what I'm going to do now is go

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.160 
the car what I'm going to do now is go
through<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:08.640> thing<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> I'll<00:02:09.630> put<00:02:09.869> four<00:02:10.140> on

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
through my thing and I'll put four on

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.560 
through my thing and I'll put four on
next<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.890> these<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.760> you'll<00:02:12.270> see<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
next to these and you'll see the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.290 
next to these and you'll see the
difference<00:02:13.280> okay<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.430> got<00:02:14.580> them<00:02:14.700> back<00:02:14.850> on<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
difference okay we got them back on the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.260 
difference okay we got them back on the
flow<00:02:15.840> rack<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.830> four<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> left<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
flow rack the four on the left are the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.360 
flow rack the four on the left are the
stock<00:02:18.660> ones<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.080> haven't<00:02:19.290> touched<00:02:19.410> for<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.250> the

the way up there is no difference in the
part<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.510> how<00:03:40.660> they<00:03:40.840> disperse<00:03:41.350> the
