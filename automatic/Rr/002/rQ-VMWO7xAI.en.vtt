00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello and welcome to hardware rat in 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.179
 this video that merz update the 800th 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.840
 euro computers as cpu an integral 55 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.849
 and 30 70 came with company 3 4 ghz like that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.310
 pretty much a meanwhile cdu 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.800
 gambling is just behind the 37 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.260
 70 k that is only on the 100th 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.670
 megahertz 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.760
 because most do not play more than 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.039
 four cores support both tv has one 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.350
 base clock of the 3.4 gigahertz one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:40.260
 turbo tact from i believe 383 8 ghz one 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.450
 tdp of 77 watts which is extremely little 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.750
 So low power consumption and good 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.700
 unfortunately, the processor has to overclock 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.410
 So that's a metal plate on the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.180
 actual processor drip and the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.969
 was not soldered at ivy bridge 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.050
 but only moored with silicone 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.969
 silicone and and around the connection 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.100
 it was just cheap to make 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.270
 Thermal compound used and can be the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.170
 exchange but by her 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.720
 Manager then warranty from the processor 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.729
 as tu cola , keep an appointment at 0 2 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.080
 macho with him you can then also the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.710
 processor really nice strong 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.970
 then overclock as mainboard a ass 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.759
 sz 77 per 3 and mainboard actually has 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 everything you need 7.1 sound card 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:33.390
 usb3 pci express 3.0 sata 3 four ddr3 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.030
 Ram ben benches so all the time 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.189
 newest and of course you can with the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.180
 still overclocking because of the tether 77 chip 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.950
 set then eight gigabyte ram of crucial 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.140
 ballistix ports ddr3 1600 the processor 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.840
 Supports until 1600 you can be quiet 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.930
 Take 1600 and the new one is a good one 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.390
 latency then a terabyte hard disk 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.740
 barracuda from Seagate, the hard drive is 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.710
 nice fast but unfortunately a bit 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 lot and then as a graphics card a 3 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.459
 gigabyte gb hd 79 50 wind briefly with the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.379
 triple cooler 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.379
 many have now requested again 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.799
 many have wished for an ati 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.120
 I'll do one again but 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.549
 really little difference I have now 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.129
 here's a few benchmark the 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:31.310
 screenshot red is ati and blue is the one 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.890
 gtx 660 to rest the 79 50 blue the 660 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.790
 which and then you pull it always comes 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.430
 play on it 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.329
 so i would say the 660 ti and the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.920
 79 50 senders on the same 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.129
 performance level keep the game where 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.129
 nvidia is usually better is the 660 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:52.579
 ti better in the games where more the ati 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.109
 cards are better the 79 50 is better 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.329
 So it really is always at stake 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.389
 on it and I think overall 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:04.879
 so that 's the 79 50 and 6 60 ti 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:08.139
 really equal to the card had three 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.040
 gigabyte video memory is not needed 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.400
 at least not at the moment 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.470
 has a 4k monitors similar so who 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.449
 in normal full-hd-resolution , the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.819
 three gigabytes never occupied two 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:25.629
 So it needs two 6 pin connectors 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:32.449
 and a maximum power consumption of 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:35.810
 250 watts then a dvd burner of 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:38.299
 Samsung 450 is expected to be quiet 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.129
 straight power e9 with the gold 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.459
 Certification ie a maximum of ten 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:47.900
 percent losses heat so that is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:51.079
 if you auslastet theoretically 400 degrees 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.290
 then so if or when 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.069
 hardware 400 watts sees then allowed 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.650
 power supply then a maximum of 440 watts on 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.989
 Power supply thus pull the power supply 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.709
 just wasting a bit of electricity and 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.959
 with the gold certification will stop 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.379
 a brand or a sign with it time 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.319
 not wasted so much and then as 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.030
 housing a dental ANZAG 9 plus I find 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.970
 pretty chic housing we just 49 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.530
 he has somehow such a euro 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.979
 fan control or similar belief 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.440
 I have that one side still such a 120 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.300
 mm 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.100
 They knock four pieces in total 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.680
 I would be different and expand 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.260
 because of only unnecessary for additional 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.150
 volume then really makes right 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.880
 So little brings three runs for the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.530
 really more than enough then i thank you 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.400
 to watch me i hope you have 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.930
 the video has fallen 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.910
 if the video is older than two months 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.370
 look later in the video description 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.160
 Click on the link to the respective one 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.020
 gaming pc k 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.270
 and then you always come to the 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.270
 latest then until the next video
