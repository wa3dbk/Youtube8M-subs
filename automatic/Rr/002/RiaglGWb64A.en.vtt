because<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.500> video<00:01:49.680> that's<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> thing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
because of that video that's not a thing

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.819 
because of that video that's not a thing
of<00:01:51.509> course<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> couldn't<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of course it's not you couldn't do that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
of course it's not you couldn't do that
you<00:01:53.310> there's<00:01:54.000> no<00:01:54.149> way<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> figure<00:01:54.659> out<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you there's no way to figure out the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.569 
you there's no way to figure out the
probability<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.430> many

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
probability of that there's so many

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.590 
probability of that there's so many
variables<00:01:56.700> there's<00:01:57.600> no<00:01:57.780> way<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:59.450> that's<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
variables there's no way so that's a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.060 
variables there's no way so that's a
weird<00:02:00.810> thing<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> other<00:02:01.649> weird

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
weird thing and then the other weird

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.120 
weird thing and then the other weird
thing<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.490> their<00:02:03.060> strategy<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.979> don't<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.100> don't

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
thing is their strategy I don't I don't

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
thing is their strategy I don't I don't
know<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.700> gear<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.659> he's<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.140> for

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
know about the gear like he's going for

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
know about the gear like he's going for
devout<00:02:07.799> shoulders<00:02:08.340> or<00:02:08.489> something<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.819> think

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
devout shoulders or something I think

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
devout shoulders or something I think
they're<00:02:09.119> cloth<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.690> he's<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> paladin<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.560> don't

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
they're cloth and he's a paladin I don't

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:10.910 
they're cloth and he's a paladin I don't
know

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
know

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.440 
know
was<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.130> thing<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.400> vanilla<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> don't

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
was a thing in vanilla or not I don't

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.360 
was a thing in vanilla or not I don't
know<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:13.310> um<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.360> their<00:02:16.080> strategy<00:02:16.370> seems

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
know but um the their strategy seems

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
know but um the their strategy seems
completely<00:02:17.730> stupid<00:02:18.390> right<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.230> you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
completely stupid right like you

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.199 
completely stupid right like you
wouldn't<00:02:19.680> want<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.920> fear<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.610> things<00:02:20.849> around

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
wouldn't want to fear the things around

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.089 
wouldn't want to fear the things around
because<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.319> would<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.470> open<00:02:22.709> up<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
because that would just open up all the

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.040 
because that would just open up all the
eggs<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:23.880> which<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.270> what<00:02:24.420> happens<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
eggs right which is what happens and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.850 
eggs right which is what happens and
which<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.440> why<00:02:25.620> they<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:25.980> die<00:02:26.280> right<00:02:26.819> so

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
which is why they all die right so

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.650 
which is why they all die right so
that's<00:02:28.860> really<00:02:29.160> strange<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.360> funny<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
that's really strange it's just funny to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080 
that's really strange it's just funny to
like<00:02:31.260> once<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.800> went<00:02:32.100> through<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.610> actual

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
like once I went through that actual

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.190 
like once I went through that actual
place<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.819> it's<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.270> like<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.480> five-man<00:02:36.989> now

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
place and it's just like a five-man now

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.870 
place and it's just like a five-man now
or<00:02:37.380> something<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.920> obviously<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.519> can<00:02:38.640> solo

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
or something and obviously you can solo

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.610 
or something and obviously you can solo
it<00:02:39.120> now<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.569> was<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.380> wouldn't

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
it now but I was just like you wouldn't

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.949 
it now but I was just like you wouldn't
want<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.099> fear<00:02:41.730> these<00:02:41.970> guys<00:02:42.180> around<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.840> they

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
want to fear these guys around like they

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.620 
want to fear these guys around like they
set<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.680> whole<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.040> your<00:02:44.160> rotation<00:02:44.700> but

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
set up this whole for your rotation but

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.320 
set up this whole for your rotation but
the<00:02:46.260> funny<00:02:46.410> thing<00:02:46.560> about<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.950> video<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.850> that

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
the funny thing about that video is that

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.570 
the funny thing about that video is that
it's<00:02:48.510> actually<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.470> not<00:02:50.069> if<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.340> didn't

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
it's actually it's not if you didn't

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.190 
it's actually it's not if you didn't
know<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.120> real<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.049> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
know it's not real like it's a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.400 
know it's not real like it's a
reenactment<00:02:53.040> right<00:02:54.049> they<00:02:55.049> say<00:02:55.260> that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
reenactment right they say that

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.259 
reenactment right they say that
something<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.799> actually<00:02:55.890> happened<00:02:56.269> it

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
something that actually happened it

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.420 
something that actually happened it
would<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.080> point<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.799> then<00:02:59.160> they

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
would have one point and then they

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.150 
would have one point and then they
decided<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.510> re-enact<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.530> make<00:03:02.010> this

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
decided to re-enact it and make this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.150 
decided to re-enact it and make this
video<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.590> don't<00:03:04.590> know<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:05.010> just

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
video of it but I don't know it's just

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.449 
video of it but I don't know it's just
kind<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.430> funny<00:03:05.670> how<00:03:06.090> your<00:03:06.830> your<00:03:07.830> outlook<00:03:08.220> or

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
kind of funny how your your outlook or

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.330 
kind of funny how your your outlook or
your<00:03:08.970> your<00:03:09.930> opinion<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.680> video<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.010> guess

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
your your opinion of that video I guess

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.220 
your your opinion of that video I guess
just<00:03:11.610> changes<00:03:12.180> completely<00:03:12.510> depending<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.110> how

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
just changes completely depending on how

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.110 
just changes completely depending on how
much<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.530> know<00:03:13.739> but<00:03:14.340> either<00:03:14.519> way<00:03:14.819> it's<00:03:15.030> just
