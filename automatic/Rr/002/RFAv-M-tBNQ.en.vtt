 almonds that we eat as well as 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.199
 to botanize is now a rich 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.109
 butter that is very healthy very 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.970
 healthy so do not move and look

 how a butter is made easy 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.550
 almonds 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.030
 ingredients for the preparation of a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 rich almond butter 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.300
 we need an oven 200 grams of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 almonds or if you want they can 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.290
 be 100 or less a blender where 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.090
 let's prepare our butter one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.940
 teaspoon olive oil if you want it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.130
 much more liquid a tupper for 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.170
 save it and aluminum foil for the oven 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.830
 we put in a chat that previously 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.530
 I made 200 grams of aluminum foil 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.730
 almonds and we're going to put it in the oven 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.700
 for 8 or 10 minutes to make a 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.190
 little when we introduce the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.110
 almonds baked with a spoon 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.240
 stick we can move them so that they 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.800
 cook very well on both sides if not 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.690
 you have an oven you can also do it in 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.810
 a pan for a period of about 10 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 minutes 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.929
 It is important that the day you want 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.759
 prepare your butter almonds and 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.409
 you can also prepare the peanut for 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.090
 learn if it's a large oven that 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.369
 is to learn because it is not to take advantage of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.520
 space and make two recipes at the same 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.899
 time they will use almost the same 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.729
 let's introduce our peanuts 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.219
 when it has cooled in the blender 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.780
 and we're going to start beating 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.020
 short periods to make us win 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.310
 our blender does not go to work 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.130
 we stop we arrange the almonds and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.879
 we followed him and when that is a recipe for 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.739
 a lot of patience because it takes time to liquefy 

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:56.379
 the so that they are like butter 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.509
 it takes but you have to have patience 

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:01.250
 we are stopping them moving for no 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.189
 burn the blender that you have to have it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.319
 very much very careful and already there 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.700
 I'm showing you how it's doing 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.470
 have patience if you want 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.209
 that is with a much more consistency 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.609
 soft you can add a spoonful of 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.609
 coconut oil olive oil 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.150
 to this butter I added a 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.430
 teaspoon of olive oil so that 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.500
 be more creamy to be much more 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.020
 easy to liquefy the does not take salt does not carry 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.940
 sugar is 100% healthy 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.970
 the day that he will give us to do this 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.440
 butter with patience with much love 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.910
 it's worth it because it 's a 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.860
 butter of a quality that does not 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.930
 you get nowhere 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.730
 They thrill you a lot when you see that you already 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.560
 It's coming out and it used to be a mug 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.600
 from mani and now it is becoming 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.880
 in a habit we are going to liquefy it until 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.710
 note that it is very very we believe and it is 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.860
 that there are no pieces of almonds left 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.270
 no side and this would be the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.370
 consistency of a peanut butter 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.100
 that nothing was added to it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.800
 takes us to oil takes us to sukarno 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.050
 takes salt if you want to start 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.490
 add something before the pay is 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.490
 important that you add salt or 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.350
 sugar then you look for a cap on a container 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.000
 plastic and go emptying mine has 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.410
 a very creamy consistency for the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.180
 teaspoon of oil that I added 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 Just one 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.950
 then let it cool and refrigerate 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.260
 the duration more or less can be two 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.820
 weeks because he does not have preserving the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.430
