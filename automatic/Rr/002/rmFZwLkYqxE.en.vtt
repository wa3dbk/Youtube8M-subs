when I take ash in the swimming every
week<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.360> feel<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.960> something<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.440> she

time<00:00:20.210> there's<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> real<00:00:21.450> consistent<00:00:21.990> routine

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
time there's a real consistent routine

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
time there's a real consistent routine
so<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> feel<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.520> she's<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.180> know

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210

approaching being a toddler that routine

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.070 
approaching being a toddler that routine
is<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:27.090> important<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.600> she<00:00:27.779> knows

it's fun for them and I think that's

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.150 
it's fun for them and I think that's
important<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.350> main

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
important and it's really the the main

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010 
important and it's really the the main
objective<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.820> having<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.210> start<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.960> early

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
objective and having them start so early

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.490 
objective and having them start so early
is<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.579> know<00:00:47.700> swimming<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.510> this

with<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:39.329> interaction<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> kids

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
with with interaction for the kids

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
with with interaction for the kids
something<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.310> only<00:01:41.520> gives<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.970> the
