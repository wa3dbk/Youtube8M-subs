00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.500
 Some people can not be warm enough first in Switzerland 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.280
 right out of all pores cattle 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.099
 they are in their element 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.320
 For this they then get into the car and take some long journeys in purchase numbers 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.409
 Admission and then finally all are going to drop in the sauna 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.720
 they could have that easier and at home 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
 the private and wellness oasis our way into today 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.269
 Kottmeier 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.339
 Craftsmen are in the circle with family Zanzinger 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.050
 Waldemar Büchele and Peter Kretschmer bring the new sauna into the house 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.020
 down here in the basement of the family home is the new 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.500
 Familiar spa area arise 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.159
 this was under the booth stands in the center 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.159
 Now, however, the mechanics will not be sweating 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.449
 the sauna comes from the finished browser from the factory 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.749
 From around twenty finished parts, a modern sauna cabin is to be built on site 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.779
 a combination of classic Finnish sauna and infrared cabin 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.589
 the basis for this are five milled wooden slats 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.739
 a wooden floor 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.130
 Civil engineering work on the fallow land and then built in the eye 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.930
 as so often advertising 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 Odenwald title race 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 because a stone floor can be cleaned better 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.430
 m and that means less germs so more given 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.840
 on the frame now come the side walls 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.880
 with half Lamann provide the necessary stop and there is Hog pulled 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.190
 After a few minutes, the new sauna takes shape before milled 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.620
 Plug-in connections allow quick installation as well as with groove and 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.370
 Spring boards 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.720
 Christoph Roquette's double crime scene was or even presentable construction 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.490
 Borkheide percent of value lost 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.670
 and here come the prefabricated parts 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.690
 from Germany's largest sauna world in Schwäbisch Hall 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.900
 nearly 6000 summer infrared cabins and steam baths arise here in the year 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.870
 Handwork 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.170
 domestic not scolded 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.160
 Ken Block from Canadian forests 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.470
 that Africa will not come from Baschi wood for use 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.820
 two common 4 million meter boards a year most of it is spruce wood 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.850
 All construction parts are made of it computer-sawn sawed 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.189
 Resta and grinded 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 Newtons and cones that facilitate assembly later 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.940
 now it goes to the frame press 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.360
 here in the chord wood frames arise the basic construction related elements 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:31.059
 just put the slats white land on the rest done the machine in 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 three minutes 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:39.229
 The next step in the evolution of aluminum foil is glued on 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.539
 we use the aluminum foil Ralf Grabsch Berrer in the sauna 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.000
 Flag bearer suspected of a tree 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.039
 Outperformer enter the room 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.069
 and there was understanding leads 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.490
 The thermal insulation of the wall is a layer of rockwool 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.650
 This ensures that the temperature in the cabin is maintained longer and 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.869
 does not have to be reheated so often 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:08.129
 once again a warehouse slide then comes the interior fitting tongue and groove 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.669
 Boards from Hamm Hardwood a North American Thannen type the wood 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.009
 is bright and odorless the solar and par excellence 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.789
 depending on the equipment, a sauna room consists of nearly 3000 individual parts 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.889
 In assembling installers lay equal electric wires the 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.869
 Roof and when elements 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.579
 and here the door is mounted 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.459
 again a frame of spruce wood comes in the middle a glass plate adorns it 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.899
 hinges with her stall 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:37.989
 "We use such as a leash 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.920
 Registered safety glass Ork that is clear «If we use the mechanical 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.299
 Bump on it comes for it does not fall into great pieces but worthy little ones 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.799
 Pieces that are not sharp-edged for that are very important in the place 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.909
 the wood for the sauna think comes from Africa 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.489
 From the Abbach like tree it is easy to store hardly any heat and settle 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.129
 good workmanship whether two people cabin or luxury custom-made 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.439
 Saunagänger sweat mostly on Apache wood 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.619
 Depending on how elaborately planned and built a sauna goes into the right way 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:12.719
 Money from just under 3000 to over 150000 euros in Schwäbisch Gmünd will be almost 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.149
 meets all customer requirements 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.069
 first winner of course Art 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.799
 Aigner called for the commercial sector on cruise ships 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.630
 for the used frigate Life small purse though 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.629
 the error occurs on wn-demand Reilly one 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.169
 as neither is the entry-level place and also for the smaller one 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.180
 Purse grab 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.700
 ordered six weeks ago 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.140
 SID the sauna room of the Zanzinger family towards completion 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.569
 It takes less than three hours for the on-site assembly of the colleagues in the factory 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.469
 have everything prepared optimally 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.280
 Finally comes the deliktischen heater 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.340
 filled with heat store the Finnish policy board 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.409
 Trial sitting in the house of the Zanzinger family 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:53.449
 there is a new attraction
