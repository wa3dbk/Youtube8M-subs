00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
here you could pretty much put up

here you could pretty much put up
anything<00:02:27.739> in<00:02:27.830> here<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.160> let<00:02:28.550> me<00:02:28.640> just<00:02:28.670> get<00:02:29.060> a

anything in here like let me just get a
pen<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.480> put<00:02:29.629> it<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.080> guys<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.379> see

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
pen and put it in so you guys can see

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.360 
pen and put it in so you guys can see
you<00:02:30.709> example<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.860> maybe<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.190> want<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
you example so if you maybe you want to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.770 
you example so if you maybe you want to
bring<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.670> school<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.150> bring<00:02:35.269> like<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> pen

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
bring it to school and bring like a pen

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.570 
bring it to school and bring like a pen
or<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.930> pencil<00:02:36.080> or<00:02:36.380> maybe<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.950> stylus<00:02:37.370> for

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
or a pencil or maybe just a stylus for

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.050 
or a pencil or maybe just a stylus for
the<00:02:37.640> iPad<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.150> could<00:02:38.300> do<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.880> like

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
the iPad you could do that so it's like

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.789 
the iPad you could do that so it's like
a<00:02:41.090> rubbery<00:02:41.480> thing<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.380> could<00:02:42.500> stretch<00:02:42.769> it

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
a rubbery thing so you could stretch it

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.900 
a rubbery thing so you could stretch it
and<00:02:43.069> put<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.549> pen<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.790> here<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.480> example<00:02:45.910> so

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
and put a pen in here for example so

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.750 
and put a pen in here for example so
that<00:02:47.090> works<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.220> for<00:02:49.549> when<00:02:49.700> you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
that works then this is for when you

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.960 
that works then this is for when you
want<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.260> put<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.500> prop<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.430> iPad<00:02:52.730> off<00:02:52.849> so

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
want to put the prop the iPad off so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.150 
want to put the prop the iPad off so
I'll<00:02:53.060> show<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.299> guys<00:02:53.510> how<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.079> works<00:02:54.319> you

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
I'll show you guys how that works you

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.000 
I'll show you guys how that works you
can<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.849> in<00:02:56.440> landscape<00:02:57.440> mode<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:57.890> has

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
can have it in landscape mode and it has

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.390 
can have it in landscape mode and it has
to<00:02:58.160> lock<00:02:58.720> lock<00:02:59.720> things<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.290> when<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.160> close<00:03:01.370> it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
to lock lock things so when you close it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.479 
to lock lock things so when you close it
the<00:03:01.640> magnetic<00:03:02.060> lock<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.799> guys<00:03:03.950> can<00:03:04.160> hear<00:03:04.310> that

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
the magnetic lock you guys can hear that

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.990 
the magnetic lock you guys can hear that
I<00:03:04.519> think<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:06.980> locks<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.370> screen<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.849> works

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
I think so it locks the screen it works

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.330 
I think so it locks the screen it works
well<00:03:08.269> with<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.540> iPad<00:03:08.870> 2<00:03:09.079> &amp;<00:03:09.349> 3

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
well with the iPad 2 &amp; 3

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.229 
well with the iPad 2 &amp; 3
at<00:03:11.000> first<00:03:11.390> they<00:03:11.840> were<00:03:11.870> having<00:03:12.260> problems<00:03:12.500> when

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
at first they were having problems when

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.270 
at first they were having problems when
with<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.420> lock<00:03:14.599> function<00:03:14.840> because<00:03:15.440> Apple

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
with the lock function because Apple

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.100 
with the lock function because Apple
changed<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.760> magnets<00:03:17.120> in<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.360> iPad<00:03:17.690> 3<00:03:17.930> but

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
changed the magnets in the iPad 3 but

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.080 
changed the magnets in the iPad 3 but
now<00:03:18.290> they<00:03:18.560> change<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.130> they're<00:03:19.459> magnets<00:03:19.849> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
now they change that they're magnets and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.559 
now they change that they're magnets and
it<00:03:20.540> works<00:03:20.720> with<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.989> iPad<00:03:21.290> 3<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.500> tested<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.569> so

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
it works with the iPad 3 I tested it so

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.270 
it works with the iPad 3 I tested it so
to<00:03:23.750> prop<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.170> up<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.440> pretty<00:03:24.680> much<00:03:24.859> just<00:03:25.040> do

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
to prop it up you pretty much just do

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.800 
to prop it up you pretty much just do
that<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:26.000> put<00:03:27.549> put<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.579> cover<00:03:29.030> underneath

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810

that you put put the cover underneath
this<00:03:30.170> right<00:03:30.410> here<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:32.120> very<00:03:32.420> sturdy<00:03:32.780> it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
this right here and it's very sturdy it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.960 
this right here and it's very sturdy it
will<00:03:33.200> never<00:03:33.500> fall<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:33.829> can<00:03:34.160> guarantee<00:03:34.579> it<00:03:34.730> you

will never fall I can guarantee it you
can<00:03:35.720> just<00:03:35.900> type<00:03:36.079> on<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.319> do<00:03:36.590> whatever<00:03:36.769> you

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
whatever you want you can also have it

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.069 
whatever you want you can also have it
well<00:03:43.819> you<00:03:43.910> can<00:03:44.030> also<00:03:44.180> adjust<00:03:44.389> it<00:03:44.750> like<00:03:44.870> this

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
well you can also adjust it like this

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.479 
well you can also adjust it like this
like<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.190> viewing<00:03:46.489> angle<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:46.970> guess<00:03:47.209> kind<00:03:47.810> of

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
like the viewing angle I guess kind of

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.410 
like the viewing angle I guess kind of
so<00:03:49.489> like<00:03:49.670> pull<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.359> in<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.440> out<00:03:51.639> so<00:03:52.639> it<00:03:52.790> you

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
so like pull this in and out so it you

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.140 
so like pull this in and out so it you
can<00:03:53.569> adjust<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:53.989> how<00:03:54.139> that<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:56.000> can

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
can adjust it how that is and you can

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.699 
can adjust it how that is and you can
still<00:03:56.359> type<00:03:56.600> on<00:03:56.840> here<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.780> that's<00:03:59.959> very<00:04:00.290> nice

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.059 

and<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:04.310> also<00:04:04.459> folds<00:04:05.079> so<00:04:06.079> pretty<00:04:06.680> much<00:04:06.799> flat

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
and it also folds so pretty much flat

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.199 
and it also folds so pretty much flat
when<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.280> have<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.639> you<00:04:07.670> just<00:04:07.880> want<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.090> have

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
when you have it you just want to have
