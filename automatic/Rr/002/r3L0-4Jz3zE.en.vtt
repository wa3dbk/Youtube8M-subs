00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
computer management section there is a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
computer management section there is a
system<00:01:57.210> tool<00:01:57.479> section<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> number<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
system tool section with a number of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
system tool section with a number of
utilities<00:01:59.310> inside<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.969> there's<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
utilities inside of that there's a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
utilities inside of that there's a
storage<00:02:00.930> option<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> there's<00:02:01.950> also<00:02:02.250> a

selection for services and applications

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.249 
selection for services and applications
and<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> expand<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.420> everything

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and I'm going to expand out everything

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.350 
and I'm going to expand out everything
so<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.130> you'll<00:02:08.610> notice<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.119> all

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so we can see it you'll notice that all

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540 
so we can see it you'll notice that all
of<00:02:09.390> these<00:02:09.720> things<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.410> tasks<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.370> an

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
of these things are tasks that as an

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.610 
of these things are tasks that as an
administrator<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.780> may<00:02:12.930> need<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.260> get<00:02:13.410> to

administrator you may need to get to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.990 
administrator you may need to get to
very<00:02:13.920> quickly<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.730> can

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
very quickly so you can

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.760 
very quickly so you can
simply<00:02:15.180> come<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:15.720> screen<00:02:16.140> select<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
utility that you need and then perhaps

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.510 
utility that you need and then perhaps
choose<00:02:18.960> another<00:02:19.410> utility<00:02:19.770> from<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.310> same

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
choose another utility from the same

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.280 
choose another utility from the same

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
be a great place to do it and you can

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.289 
be a great place to do it and you can
also<00:03:40.590> look<00:03:40.890> at<00:03:41.040> all<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.519> built-in<00:03:41.760> groups

or create some new groups that you can

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.850 
or create some new groups that you can

ability<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.200> look<00:03:49.860> at<00:03:50.010> how<00:03:50.250> your<00:03:50.549> computer<00:03:51.030> is

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
ability to look at how your computer is

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.360 
ability to look at how your computer is
performing<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.900> look<00:03:52.320> at<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.560> over<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> very

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
performing and look at it over a very

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.009 
performing and look at it over a very
long<00:03:53.670> period<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:54.150> time<00:03:54.239> well<00:03:54.810> I'd<00:03:54.870> be

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
long period of time well I'd be

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.870 
long period of time well I'd be
completely<00:03:55.590> separate<00:03:56.070> video<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.700> this

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
completely separate video on this

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.000 
completely separate video on this
because<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.570> can<00:03:57.720> really<00:03:57.930> go<00:03:58.170> into<00:03:58.500> detail

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
because you can really go into detail

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.759 
because you can really go into detail
about<00:03:59.040> how<00:03:59.400> your<00:04:00.030> computer<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.870> performing

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
about how your computer is performing

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.680 
about how your computer is performing
and<00:04:02.040> perhaps<00:04:02.370> find<00:04:02.670> ways<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.910> make<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.360> work

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
and perhaps find ways to make it work

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.750 
and perhaps find ways to make it work
a<00:04:03.810> little<00:04:04.140> more<00:04:04.320> efficiently<00:04:04.829> your<00:04:05.489> device

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
a little more efficiently your device

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.880 
a little more efficiently your device

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
manager is in here as well this is a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.470 
manager is in here as well this is a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
great place to go to see how your

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.180 
great place to go to see how your

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
computer may be performing is it working

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.920 
computer may be performing is it working
properly<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.730> not<00:04:14.910> do<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.209> need<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.600> install

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
properly is it not do I need to install

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.479 
properly is it not do I need to install
a<00:04:15.989> new<00:04:16.079> driver<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.799> would<00:04:16.950> be<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.250> place<00:04:17.459> to

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
a new driver this would be the place to

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.880 
a new driver this would be the place to
go<00:04:17.700> those<00:04:18.510> are<00:04:18.540> all<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.140> system<00:04:19.650> tools

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
go those are all of the system tools

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.219 
go those are all of the system tools
let's<00:04:20.190> look<00:04:20.459> at<00:04:20.640> storage<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.690> storage<00:04:21.930> has

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
let's look at storage and storage has

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.440 
let's look at storage and storage has
one<00:04:22.500> central<00:04:22.740> place<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.099> go<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> disk

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
one central place to go that is the disk

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.600 
one central place to go that is the disk
management<00:04:25.080> screen<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.039> can<00:04:26.099> see<00:04:26.340> all<00:04:26.580> of
