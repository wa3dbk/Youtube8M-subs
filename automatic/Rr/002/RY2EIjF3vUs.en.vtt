00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
could see them all over the rocks some

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.449 
could see them all over the rocks some
in<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.299> base<00:03:21.479> some<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.139> sand<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:23.989> and

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
in the base some in the sand and and

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.580 
in the base some in the sand and and
