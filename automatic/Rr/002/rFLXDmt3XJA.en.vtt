 hi girls today is the video is fake people 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.210
 nicole's birthday and this one is 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 good fake chicken birthday 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.539
 last year's guinea pig and I 'm going 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.109
 take off and then girls it's me already 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 I dismantled the painted chicken cake 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.009
 and things are there and Nicole is 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.430
 taking everything to play and I thought the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.200
 and damage the Styrofoam 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.969
 but it was not easy to get the shipped 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 special body I think because 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.579
 I used hot glue so I do not think so. 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.950
 It meant so much Styrofoam and he is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.489
 practically new nor does it look like I used it 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.570
 and now I'm going to reuse it to do 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.570
 snow white 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.710
 so girls 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:07.140
 This is my fake white 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:11.580
 snow is ready between shavings, no missing 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.540
 put the cake top and a tie I want 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.560
 make a tie here and maybe i'll tie 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.689
 It is common to see the best 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.080
 right here in the middle and this part of the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.780
 I mean, I made a punch with those 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.479
 white polka dot beads 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.329
 I got paper drills and went 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.990
 several times the ipva and I got the balls 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.670
 and placed here with hot glue okay I 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.970
 I glued it with hot glue 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.149
 Yeah, I also put the tape on. 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.880
 below it is the same principle as the part 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.200
 blue is the same thing has not changed anything 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 The way I did it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.430
 okay and I also did the same thing with 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.579
 yellow part is 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.740
 I put it nestles the tape and put 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.290
 the buttons like en 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.460
 I cut the part that passes the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.729
 line ne 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.060
 and put it on and brake and stayed like this 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.430
