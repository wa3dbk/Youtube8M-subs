today I'm going to talk about how the
Sun<00:00:05.190> makes<00:00:05.640> vitamin<00:00:06.150> D<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:07.259> skin<00:00:07.950> exposure

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
Sun makes vitamin D with skin exposure

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.720 
Sun makes vitamin D with skin exposure
to<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> Sun<00:00:09.410> so<00:00:10.410> here's<00:00:10.769> what<00:00:11.099> happens

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
to the Sun so here's what happens

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.860 
to the Sun so here's what happens
sounds<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.240> detective<00:00:12.840> story<00:00:13.009> kind<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.099> is

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
sounds like a detective story kind of is

sounds like a detective story kind of is
the<00:00:15.870> UVB<00:00:16.289> ray<00:00:16.710> which<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> particular<00:00:17.850> ray

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the UVB ray which is a particular ray

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.320 
the UVB ray which is a particular ray
that<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.260> emitted<00:00:19.650> by<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> Sun<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.150> in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
that is emitted by the Sun and it is in

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
that is emitted by the Sun and it is in
the<00:00:21.600> non-visible<00:00:22.230> light<00:00:22.949> spectrum

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the non-visible light spectrum

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.380 
the non-visible light spectrum
strikes<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> skin<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:26.580> when<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.849> strikes<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
strikes the skin and when it strikes the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
strikes the skin and when it strikes the
skin<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.230> interacts<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:28.890> cholesterol<00:00:29.490> just

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
skin it interacts with cholesterol just

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.740 
skin it interacts with cholesterol just
under<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> skin<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.820> after<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.329> becomes

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
under the skin and after that it becomes

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.920 
under the skin and after that it becomes
a<00:00:34.079> pre<00:00:34.500> vitamin<00:00:34.710> D<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.880> then<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.780> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
a pre vitamin D and then from there it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.369 
a pre vitamin D and then from there it
ends<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.290> being<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.910> vitamin<00:00:38.910> D<00:00:39.090> vitamin<00:00:39.450> d3<00:00:39.989> in

cholecalciferol<00:00:46.010> from<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
cholecalciferol from there it is it is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
cholecalciferol from there it is it is
goes<00:00:48.809> into<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> blood<00:00:49.410> then<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> cleared

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
goes into the blood then it is cleared

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.270 
goes into the blood then it is cleared
from<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> blood<00:00:51.449> by<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> liver<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> pops

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
from the blood by the liver then it pops

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
from the blood by the liver then it pops
out<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:54.710> 25<00:00:55.710> hydroxy<00:00:56.550> vitamin<00:00:57.030> D<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.500> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
out as 25 hydroxy vitamin D and at that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560 
out as 25 hydroxy vitamin D and at that
point<00:00:59.010> by<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> way<00:00:59.370> that's<00:00:59.730> where<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.300> you're

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
point by the way that's where if you're

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.020 
point by the way that's where if you're
testing<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.079> vitamin<00:01:01.530> D<00:01:01.620> levels<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
testing for vitamin D levels that's the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.450 
testing for vitamin D levels that's the
point<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.449> which<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.470> tested<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.220> for

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
point at which you get tested is for

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.380 
point at which you get tested is for
that<00:01:05.610> 25<00:01:05.970> hydroxy<00:01:06.330> vitamin<00:01:06.720> D<00:01:08.030> then<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> goes

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that 25 hydroxy vitamin D then it goes

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.960 
that 25 hydroxy vitamin D then it goes
from<00:01:09.780> back<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> blood<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.610> cleared

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
from back into the blood and is cleared

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
from back into the blood and is cleared
by<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> kidneys<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> kidneys<00:01:15.110> pop<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
by the kidneys and the kidneys pop it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.940 
by the kidneys and the kidneys pop it
out<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.159> hormone<00:01:17.790> 125<00:01:18.780> dihydroxy<00:01:19.590> vitamin

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
out as the hormone 125 dihydroxy vitamin

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.030 
out as the hormone 125 dihydroxy vitamin
D<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.880> hormone<00:01:21.330> has<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.810> amazing<00:01:22.409> job<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
D this hormone has an amazing job in the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
D this hormone has an amazing job in the
body<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.490> does<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.000> many<00:01:24.150> things<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.750> two<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
body it does so many things but two of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.060 
body it does so many things but two of
the<00:01:25.170> main<00:01:25.820> jobs<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> 125<00:01:28.200> dihydroxy

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the main jobs that the 125 dihydroxy

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.940 
the main jobs that the 125 dihydroxy
vitamin<00:01:29.579> D<00:01:29.729> hormone<00:01:30.180> does<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
vitamin D hormone does is that it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
vitamin D hormone does is that it
increases<00:01:32.460> calcium<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.479> phosphorus

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
increases calcium and phosphorus

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.600 
increases calcium and phosphorus
phosphorus<00:01:34.650> absorption<00:01:35.579> by<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.850> much<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.150> 50%

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
phosphorus absorption by as much as 50%

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.730 
phosphorus absorption by as much as 50%
so<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:39.360> how<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.780> make<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.650> vitamin<00:01:41.250> D<00:01:41.570> but

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
so that's how we make that vitamin D but

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
so that's how we make that vitamin D but
we're<00:01:43.740> also<00:01:43.920> told<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.540> enough

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
we're also told you will have enough

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
we're also told you will have enough

why<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.959> UVB<00:02:10.770> ray<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.360> attenuated<00:02:12.360> very

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
why the UVB ray is attenuated very

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.400 
why the UVB ray is attenuated very
easily

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
easily

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
easily
meaning<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.790> won't<00:02:14.940> come<00:02:15.030> through

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
meaning that it won't come through

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.510 
meaning that it won't come through

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
not going to make vitamin D so if you

winter we don't make vitamin D from

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.690 
winter we don't make vitamin D from
November<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.120> end<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.570> March<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:41.220> even<00:02:41.610> in

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
we are very high out to do latitude so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.260 
we are very high out to do latitude so
these<00:02:49.530> are<00:02:49.710> little<00:02:49.950> important<00:02:50.550> pieces<00:02:51.060> to

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
these are little important pieces to

these are little important pieces to
understand<00:02:52.110> about<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.710> Sun<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:54.320> fog<00:02:55.320> also

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
understand about the Sun and fog also

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.170 
understand about the Sun and fog also
which<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.340> something<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.820> get<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
which is something that we get in the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.980 
which is something that we get in the
Bay<00:02:57.300> Area<00:02:57.620> UVB<00:02:58.620> rays<00:02:58.770> will<00:02:58.980> come<00:02:59.160> through<00:02:59.280> that

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
Bay Area UVB rays will come through that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.440 
Bay Area UVB rays will come through that
now<00:03:00.990> what<00:03:01.140> if<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.380> dark<00:03:01.890> skin<00:03:02.450> really
