you'll find that the surfaces are not
hard<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.840> manage<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.830> longer<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> leave<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
hard to manage the longer you leave it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
hard to manage the longer you leave it
with<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> contaminants<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:13.620> outside

with the contaminants from outside
getting<00:01:14.219> at<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.790> greases<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.600> on

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
getting at it or greases and so on

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.600 
getting at it or greases and so on
building<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.380> becomes<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.520> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
building up it becomes a little more of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
building up it becomes a little more of
a<00:01:17.700> challenging<00:01:18.210> process<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.740> you're

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a challenging process but if you're

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.469 
a challenging process but if you're
