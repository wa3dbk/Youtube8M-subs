stronger talk at lower revs and in the
mid<00:04:19.229> range<00:04:19.410> makes<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.100> r15<00:04:20.669> easier<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.660> ride

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
so on the engine and performance front

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.590 
so on the engine and performance front
the<00:04:25.199> r15<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.800> more<00:04:26.130> enjoyable<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:26.850> easier<00:04:27.479> to

the r15 is more enjoyable and easier to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.050 
the r15 is more enjoyable and easier to
use<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.860> not<00:04:29.160> all<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.430> more

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
use but it's not all that more

exhilarating than before however the
ar-15s<00:04:34.080> magic<00:04:34.470> has<00:04:34.680> also<00:04:34.979> been<00:04:35.280> down<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.790> its

ar-15s magic has also been down to its

ar-15s magic has also been down to its

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.740 

now<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.729> tweaks<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.240> engine<00:04:42.510> aren't

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
now the tweaks to the engine aren't

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.029 
now the tweaks to the engine aren't
enough<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.050> blow<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.380> away<00:04:43.530> but<00:04:43.889> I<00:04:43.919> am

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
enough to blow you away but I am

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.890 
enough to blow you away but I am
expecting<00:04:44.460> great<00:04:44.940> things<00:04:44.970> from<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.690> chassis

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
expecting great things from the chassis

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.409 
expecting great things from the chassis
because<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.710> sweet<00:04:47.039> handling<00:04:47.370> r15<00:04:47.789> has<00:04:48.060> had

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
because the sweet handling r15 has had

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.000 
because the sweet handling r15 has had
some<00:04:48.630> changes<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.199> swinging<00:04:49.770> arm<00:04:49.889> has<00:04:49.979> been

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
some changes to it swinging arm has been

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.620 
some changes to it swinging arm has been
made<00:04:50.280> longer<00:04:50.639> so<00:04:50.789> wheelbase<00:04:51.120> is<00:04:51.300> longer

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
made longer so wheelbase is longer

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.300 
made longer so wheelbase is longer
weight<00:04:52.110> distribution<00:04:52.410> has<00:04:52.800> changed<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.220> of
