00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.740
There are times when you’re working with
canvasses and paint and paper and brushes,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.660
and everything’s fine on a single plane,
and then all of a sudden, anybody, whether

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.240
they’re able-bodied or not, needs something
more than that. And what we’ve found more

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.140
recently with our artists, because of the
way that they want to explore their own passions,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.019
we’ve been stretching ourselves and them
to reach bigger canvasses and altogether,

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.149
make more of what they can do.
And by having an easel, which is so versatile,

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.210
and incredibly useful, because it can go in
any shape, take any size canvas, can lift

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.969
up high, fall down low at the drop of a hat,
and is so incredibly user-friendly, it’s

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.454
entirely transformed our painting class.

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:53.499
Obviously, you have a great passion for painting.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:01.370
It’s shown in your work—that is just incredible.
You can clearly see that’s The Last Supper.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:11.040
So do you have certain topics which you find
really inspiring?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.100
L-A-N-D.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.900
Landscapes, yeah?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.100
V-A-N

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.900
Van Gogh,
by any chance? Aha! Brilliant.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.360
I think everybody’s become very excited
about what they’re doing, because it’s

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.549
so much easier. I remember, it was one pivotal
moment, when we were painting Elaine’s rainbow

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.400
painting, which just is up on the wall there,
which was actually where Elaine was saying,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.170
“Are your arms getting tired, and do you
want to stop now?” Because I’d been holding

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.210
her canvas for about 20 minutes, in various
different places. And you know, she was becoming

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.840
discouraged, because she was worrying about
me.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.390
And by having a canvas which is being supported
so beautifully by this wonderful easel, she’s

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.700
entirely free to paint for as long as she
wants, and in whatever way works for her.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.940
And so, immediately then, the relationship
we have within the class isn’t so much supporter

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.230
and supported, it’s actually entirely about
being independent, and actually completely

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.510
in your own zone, which is really something
you would always want for anybody, really.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.180
I do two art classes-
What do you do in the art classes?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.840
Art

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.920
You’ve just seen Tina using the first easel,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.580
and this is an example of the second easel,
which we’re making for Mark. We’ve learned

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.260
a lot from the first one, and we are constantly
seeking to improve all our designs, and this

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.660
is a good example of it. There are certain
features of it that don’t feature on the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.910
original, and they are improvements of course.
Our apprentice George is busy making these

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.930
parts.
I think when we started we didn’t think

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.510
that we’d ever get anything quite so good.
And I don’t mean to be rude, but actually

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.200
it’s hard, when you make a great demand—excuse
the expression—on somebody to come up with

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.490
something so clever. And Paul and Lynnette
and DEMAND have managed to do just that, to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:30.470
break it and bring it back to being very grounded.
It’s not going anywhere fast, but it’s

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.640
extremely easy to get close to the chairs,
and it works extremely well in lots of different

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.720
classes, so we’ve had all our ambitions
realized, which is fantastic.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.460
It makes a huge difference.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.260
I just enjoy painting.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.960
