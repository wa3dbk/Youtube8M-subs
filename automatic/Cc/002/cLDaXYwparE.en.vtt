00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.880
 nowadays the theme 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.219
 of sound insulation always takes 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.080
 greater importance that lives in the city a 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 along busy roads or in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 proximity to an airport needs 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.510
 windows with high sound insulation 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.189
 to sleep soundly 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.470
 excessive noise pollution 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.720
 in fact it not only generates disturbances of the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 sleep but can also cause difficulties 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 concentration and in extreme cases 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.130
 cause serious hearing damage 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.239
 the sound waves penetrate the windows into 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.070
 two ways 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.410
 first they propagate through the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.910
 glass plates this phenomenon defined 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.739
 resonance 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 secondly they penetrate into the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 joints not perfectly insulated la 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 hermetic sealing of windows and doors 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 fundamental importance also for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 protect indoor environments from 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.260
 drafts and water inlet 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 rain in case of heavy rain 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.010
 for this purpose the finstral windows 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.289
 made in the modern system 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 median gasket are equipped with a 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.189
 large collection chamber that allows 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.400
 to let the water flow outwards 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.200
 in complete safety to counteract the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 sound propagation through i 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 glass is useful to use glass plates 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.310
 of different thickness that prevent it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 the parallel vibration particularly 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 indicated are the coupled glasses in which 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.850
 two plates glued by means of a 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.950
 special film but not forming a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.619
 heavy glass but at the same time a lot 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.790
 elastic able to absorb 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.119
 effectively the transmission of waves 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.670
 sound to prevent sound waves 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.409
 spread themselves through the escapes but us 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.540
 fold high gaskets 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.220
 applied compression elasticity 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.590
 uniform over the entire length of the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.930
 profile the standard design of the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 windows and doors provides two seals which 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.860
 also exclude the entry of air and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.049
 water to increase properties 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.909
 the system is soundproofing the window 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.250
 median seal can also be 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.140
 accompanied by a third gasket in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.810
 window installation phase 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.430
 specific silicone sealing tapes 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.080
 sheaths guarantee its correctness 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.729
 Armenian outfit 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.640
 it is sufficient that a 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.470
 standard glass of the finstral range for 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.209
 offer adequate insulation from 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.170
 noise near a road a 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.569
 medium traffic but when you live long 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.209
 very busy and arterial roads 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.069
 appropriate to choose special glasses 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.430
 soundproofing than with a felling 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.110
 acoustic equal to 42 lcd allow to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.760
 get a double value flying 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.760
 compared to a standard glass 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.040
 if instead the dwelling located in the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.170
 near an airport of 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.560
 a finstral motorway offers the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.750
 window with door coupled thanks to 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 a soundproofing power that reaches up to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.810
 47 de chile and safe the maximum

 of the night between the components of 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 primary importance of the window 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.660
 fundamental is the hardware that has the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.489
 task of ensuring that also in 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.350
 presence of strong wind loads 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.360
 the door is not moved by 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.040
 this phenomenon that seals 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.100
 would prevent good sound insulation 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.560
 and original be annoying drafts 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.510
 finstral air only uses 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.730
 first-rate hardware components 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.070
 to make windows with one 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.209
 air permeability in class 4 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.760
 according to uni en 12207 that is the best 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.709
 class also achievable in terms of 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.989
 watertight in finn windows 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.980
 stars fall into the best class 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.350
 that is the class 9a according to uni en 12 20 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.570

 median seal and humidity and dust 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.850
 they cannot damage the

 finstral products is subjected to 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.010
 constant checks carried out by 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.720
 independent test institutes e 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.360
