see which iPod dog would fit because I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.420 
see which iPod dog would fit because I

have a first-generation
iTouch<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.830> tried<00:00:22.830> out<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.400> which<00:00:24.090> is

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
iTouch I tried out the one which is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.089 
iTouch I tried out the one which is
which<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.080> set<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.769> second

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099

which was set out for the second
generation<00:00:26.130> high-touch<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> thought<00:00:27.449> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
generation high-touch so I thought that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.259 
generation high-touch so I thought that
would<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.519> use<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.150> actually

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
would be the one to use it's actually

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.260 
would be the one to use it's actually

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.790 
now again about the design as I was
saying<00:02:43.970> before<00:02:44.300> it's<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:45.230> slick<00:02:45.530> it's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
saying before it's so slick it's

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.580 
saying before it's so slick it's
designed<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.400> fit<00:02:46.690> into<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.840> corner<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.350> room

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
designed to fit into a corner of room

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.260 
designed to fit into a corner of room
and<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.130> whole<00:02:49.250> idea<00:02:49.550> behind<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.240> to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
and the whole idea behind that is to

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.940 
and the whole idea behind that is to
give<00:02:50.780> maximum<00:02:51.140> sound<00:02:53.170> experience<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.800> it's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
give maximum sound experience and it's

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.750 
give maximum sound experience and it's
just<00:02:55.370> it's<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.390> unbelievable<00:02:57.160> now<00:02:58.160> what<00:02:58.730> I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
just it's it's unbelievable now what I

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.990 
just it's it's unbelievable now what I
do<00:02:58.850> quickly<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.720> if<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.050> show<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.320> guys<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
do quickly is if I show you guys the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.790 
do quickly is if I show you guys the
controller<00:03:02.420> again<00:03:02.750> I'm<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.140> going<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.410> do<00:03:03.560> a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
controller again I'm just going to do a

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.080 
controller again I'm just going to do a
general<00:03:04.660> review<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.650> controller

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
general review of this the controller

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.190 
general review of this the controller
for<00:03:08.090> me<00:03:08.239> personally<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.920> quite<00:03:10.340> simplistic

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
for me personally it is quite simplistic

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.580 
for me personally it is quite simplistic
again<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:13.130> good<00:03:13.720> really<00:03:14.720> thin<00:03:14.989> just<00:03:15.410> a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
again it's it's good really thin just a

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.130 
again it's it's good really thin just a
sleek<00:03:15.830> looking<00:03:16.160> little<00:03:16.550> controller<00:03:17.140> you've

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
sleek looking little controller you've

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.830 
sleek looking little controller you've
got<00:03:18.350> obviously<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.220> obvious<00:03:19.430> pause<00:03:19.940> skip

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
got obviously the obvious pause skip

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.410 
got obviously the obvious pause skip
track<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.410> fast<00:03:21.650> forwards<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.489> then<00:03:23.270> the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
track the fast forwards and then the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.050 
track the fast forwards and then the
switch<00:03:23.660> off<00:03:23.840> button<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.410> think<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.519> only<00:03:25.640> the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
switch off button I think the only the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.449 
switch off button I think the only the
only<00:03:26.209> thing<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.660> have<00:03:26.780> against<00:03:27.170> this<00:03:27.320> is<00:03:27.620> it

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
only thing I have against this is it

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.860 
only thing I have against this is it
would<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.670> nice<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.120> maybe<00:03:29.269> have<00:03:29.480> like<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.660> kind

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
would be nice to maybe have like a kind

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.699 
would be nice to maybe have like a kind
of<00:03:29.959> scroll<00:03:30.380> option<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.459> control<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.709> iPod

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
of scroll option to control the iPod

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.110 
of scroll option to control the iPod
iTouch<00:03:33.860> or<00:03:34.190> whatever<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.580> use<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:35.090> that

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
iTouch or whatever you use and that

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.729 
iTouch or whatever you use and that
would<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:36.019> been<00:03:36.110> good<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.260> kind<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.500> scroll

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
would have been good to kind of scroll

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.800 
would have been good to kind of scroll
through<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.040> menu<00:03:37.299> but<00:03:38.299> aside<00:03:38.540> from<00:03:38.600> that

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
through the menu but aside from that

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.680 
through the menu but aside from that
it's<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:40.519> know<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.850> there's<00:03:41.239> nothing<00:03:41.540> wrong

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
for a little bit cheaper Amazon always

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.250 
for a little bit cheaper Amazon always
are<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:09.650> these<00:04:09.769> kind<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.100> range<00:04:10.340> from<00:04:10.610> about

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
are but these kind of range from about

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.650 
are but these kind of range from about
280<00:04:12.260> pounds<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.070> about<00:04:13.180> well<00:04:14.180> they<00:04:14.299> can<00:04:14.450> go<00:04:14.600> up

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
280 pounds to about well they can go up

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.969 
280 pounds to about well they can go up
to<00:04:14.810> about<00:04:15.530> 400<00:04:15.890> pounds<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.320> it's

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
to about 400 pounds so the it's

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.349 
to about 400 pounds so the it's
worthwhile<00:04:19.250> just<00:04:19.609> having<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.880> quick<00:04:20.090> shop
