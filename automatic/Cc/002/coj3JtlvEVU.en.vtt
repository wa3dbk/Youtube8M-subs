00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
put your d-ring in that you don't put it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.359 
put your d-ring in that you don't put it
at<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.610> bottom<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> run<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.070> at

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
at the very bottom you want to run up at

00:01:38.369 --> 00:02:03.730 
at the very bottom you want to run up at
least<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.909> row

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.890 

and<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.030> one<00:02:05.180> of<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.360> reasons<00:02:05.659> why<00:02:05.869> I

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
and this is one of the reasons why I

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.540 
and this is one of the reasons why I
don't<00:02:06.320> use<00:02:06.790> pliers<00:02:07.790> that<00:02:07.940> have<00:02:08.179> teeth<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.720> them

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
don't use pliers that have teeth on them

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.370 
don't use pliers that have teeth on them
because<00:02:10.550> if<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.819> had<00:02:11.030> teeth<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:12.140> it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
because if I had teeth on it then it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.059 
because if I had teeth on it then it
would<00:02:12.500> snag<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.130> cord<00:02:16.420> okay<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.740> we're<00:02:18.980> gonna

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
would snag the cord okay so we're gonna

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.650 
would snag the cord okay so we're gonna
want<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.790> run<00:02:20.270> our<00:02:22.989> our<00:02:23.989> next<00:02:24.350> d-ring<00:02:25.660> right

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
want to run our our next d-ring right

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.000 
want to run our our next d-ring right
here<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.870> we're<00:02:30.020> gonna<00:02:30.110> go<00:02:30.319> ahead<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.500> pull

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
here so we're gonna go ahead and pull

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.910 
here so we're gonna go ahead and pull
this<00:02:31.959> through<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:35.470> then<00:02:36.470> we're<00:02:36.590> going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.739> put

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
this through and then we're going to put

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:59.690 
this through and then we're going to put
our<00:02:37.010> d-ring<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:41.769> then<00:02:42.769> we'll<00:02:42.950> continue<00:02:43.220> on

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.339 

okay<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.300> again<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.660> need<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> watch<00:03:02.110> our

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
okay and again we need to watch our

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:24.020 
okay and again we need to watch our
twist

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.160 

there<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.870> go

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.380 

okay<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:29.230> we<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.680> our<00:03:29.830> first<00:03:30.070> one<00:03:30.400> situated

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
okay so we have our first one situated

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.750 
okay so we have our first one situated
so<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.230> looks<00:03:32.500> like<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:35.430> what<00:03:36.430> we'll<00:03:36.580> do

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
so it looks like this and what we'll do

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.300 
so it looks like this and what we'll do
is<00:03:37.000> come<00:03:37.570> back<00:03:37.780> down<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.410> we'll<00:03:39.100> go<00:03:39.280> through

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
is come back down and we'll go through

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.690 
is come back down and we'll go through
that<00:03:39.580> again<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:41.290> we<00:03:41.380> have<00:03:41.530> two<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:42.190> our

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
that again so that we have two of our

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:56.589 
that again so that we have two of our
cords<00:03:43.390> running<00:03:43.570> through<00:03:43.990> it

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:04.670 

all<00:03:57.599> right<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.140> think<00:03:58.500> we're<00:03:58.890> ready<00:03:58.920> to<00:04:03.680> pull

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
all right I think we're ready to pull

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.610 
all right I think we're ready to pull
our<00:04:04.860> other<00:04:05.069> piece<00:04:05.879> out<00:04:06.150> here<00:04:06.470> give<00:04:07.470> ourselves

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
our other piece out here give ourselves

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.960 
our other piece out here give ourselves
a<00:04:07.980> little<00:04:08.160> bit<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.489> room<00:04:08.640> work

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.630 

so<00:04:16.570> right<00:04:16.810> here<00:04:17.260> we<00:04:17.440> need<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.590> make<00:04:17.890> sure<00:04:17.950> that

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
so right here we need to make sure that

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.200 
so right here we need to make sure that
we're<00:04:19.540> going<00:04:19.780> through<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.940> d-ring<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.850> want

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
then we're going to go through the

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.700 
then we're going to go through the
d-ring<00:06:02.000> and<00:06:02.180> then<00:06:03.110> we'll<00:06:03.260> go<00:06:03.380> over<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.790> top

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
d-ring and then we'll go over the top

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:17.920 
d-ring and then we'll go over the top
and<00:06:06.850> then<00:06:07.850> under<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:17.180> again<00:06:17.300> watch<00:06:17.690> your

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
and then under and again watch your

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.900 
and then under and again watch your
twist

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:44.040 

and<00:06:26.910> come<00:06:27.630> down

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.170 

so<00:06:44.620> now<00:06:44.740> that<00:06:44.860> we<00:06:44.979> have<00:06:45.160> our<00:06:45.190> D<00:06:45.669> running<00:06:45.970> in

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
so now that we have our D running in

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.010 
so now that we have our D running in
there<00:06:46.680> we're<00:06:47.680> going<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:47.889> do<00:06:48.039> one<00:06:48.430> more<00:06:48.840> row<00:06:49.840> on

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
there we're going to do one more row on

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.649 
there we're going to do one more row on
this<00:06:50.229> side<00:06:50.500> and<00:06:50.800> then<00:06:51.400> we'll<00:06:51.580> start<00:06:51.940> to

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659 
this side and then we'll start to

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.860 
this side and then we'll start to
scrunch<00:06:53.020> everything<00:06:53.229> up<00:06:53.650> together
