00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.310 
water now let the water come to a boil
before<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.700> lid<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.330> cook<00:02:56.390> under

before we put the lid on and cook under

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.080 
before we put the lid on and cook under
pressure

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
pressure

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.020 
pressure
now<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> water<00:02:59.810> has<00:03:00.050> started<00:03:00.170> boiling

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
now that the water has started boiling

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.120 
now that the water has started boiling
we'll<00:03:02.030> close<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.540> cooker<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.200> cook<00:03:03.230> under

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
we'll close the cooker and cook under

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.880 
we'll close the cooker and cook under
pressure<00:03:04.250> for<00:03:04.820> about<00:03:05.120> 2<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.600> 3<00:03:05.930> whistles<00:03:06.380> now

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
pressure for about 2 to 3 whistles now

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.560 
pressure for about 2 to 3 whistles now
that<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.250> 3<00:03:07.460> missiles<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:08.030> been<00:03:08.180> given<00:03:08.450> out

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
that the 3 missiles have been given out

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.310 
that the 3 missiles have been given out
we'll<00:03:09.230> switch<00:03:09.440> off<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.830> fire<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:11.050> wait<00:03:12.050> till

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
we'll switch off the fire and wait till

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.410 
we'll switch off the fire and wait till
the<00:03:12.470> pressure<00:03:12.800> reduces<00:03:13.459> before<00:03:13.790> opening<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
the pressure reduces before opening the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.590 
the pressure reduces before opening the
lid<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.380> cooker<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.890> once<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:17.360> pressure

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
lid of the cooker and once the pressure

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.710 
lid of the cooker and once the pressure
reduces<00:03:18.200> we'll<00:03:18.410> open<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.830> lid<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.720> so

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
reduces we'll open the lid and so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.350 
reduces we'll open the lid and so
straight<00:03:21.320> away<00:03:21.350> from<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.980> cooker<00:03:22.520> itself<00:03:22.880> now

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
straight away from the cooker itself now

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.030 
straight away from the cooker itself now
let<00:03:23.600> us<00:03:23.630> see<00:03:23.930> if<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.140> pressure<00:03:24.350> has<00:03:24.590> reduced

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
let us see if the pressure has reduced

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:34.570 
let us see if the pressure has reduced
yes<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.640> has<00:03:26.020> slowly<00:03:27.020> open<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.740> lid

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.840 

perfect

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.270 

this<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.140> right<00:03:43.320> consistency<00:03:44.250> I

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
this is just the right consistency I

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.260 
this is just the right consistency I
wanted<00:03:46.640> drizzle<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.670> little<00:03:47.760> ghee<00:03:48.740> and<00:03:50.090> here<00:03:51.090> is

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
wanted drizzle a little ghee and here is

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.560 
wanted drizzle a little ghee and here is
it<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.720> eat<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.770> hot<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:54.330> will<00:03:54.450> get

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
it really eat it hot and you will get

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.320 
it really eat it hot and you will get
the<00:03:54.690> real<00:03:54.840> taste<00:03:55.140> of<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:56.580> can<00:03:56.790> also<00:03:57.000> have

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
the real taste of it you can also have

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.990 
the real taste of it you can also have
it<00:03:57.450> when<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:57.720> cold<00:03:58.080> but<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.220> definitely<00:03:59.460> is

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
it when it's cold but it definitely is

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:11.059 
it when it's cold but it definitely is
much<00:04:00.540> better<00:04:00.840> when<00:04:01.080> it<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.350> really<00:04:01.530> hot

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.129
