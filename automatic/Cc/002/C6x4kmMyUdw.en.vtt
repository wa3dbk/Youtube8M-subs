00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.730
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 more informations videos current 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.300
 opponent 2 patch of today sometime 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.489
 So going live will be live 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 I will ask me what time 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.879
 next to the course new story 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.480
 There are also new weapons in the section 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.320
 game 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.909
 and we have the airship here 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.949
 weapons year in series the airship 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.800
 made by takkt very stylish that 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.970
 No one was tall that was in the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.790
 Internat that is not seen me 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.019
 what you think so we see it exists 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.840
 new weapons in the game 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.910
 they are very reminiscent of the technical 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.979
 peculiarities of our airships from the pact 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.410
 to have 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.289
 dragonflies wing-like elements very much 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.539
 high-resolution textures the mechanical 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.100
 Parts once remind of astra technique 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.360
 and we just also so I 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.619
 say it is an insect tank style 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.759
 the most weapons get here 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.679
 as you can see at the share 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.390
 one horns I find the weapons so in 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.340
 your high-resolution part very nice 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.840
 I am very happy that it is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.520
 more and more high resolution weapons in the game 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.989
 here you will find the whole thing again 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.069
 the whole thing is clearer 

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:33.840
 of course available again in the 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.310
 Black lions do for black lions 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.160
 tickets you get with black 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.380
 solve lion sound key to the crusher 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.270
 here you get in the game shop or per 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.149
 randomly dropped or inside yours 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.360
 personal character story and the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.369
 You can also farm on this story 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 he has to go for level 20 as we do 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.330
 but that's a bit 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.470
 more complicated one must therefore very much 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.360
 you're lucky that you 're either ten 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.099
 gets snippets or just a whole 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.500
 Ticket that accumulates over time 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.679
 but mostly the weapons are hers 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.660
 Worth not quite so high in the 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.039
 times where you only need one ticket 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.619
 means if you are one month long 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.450
 nice and diligently found new dungeon 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.120
 gold saves and then plays normally 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.770
 you loose one month of Mahler 100 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.720
 100 times left over as 100 gold and 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.629
 can you without problems times such a 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.300
 afford weapons skin 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.190
 Of course it makes sense 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.170
 to wait until the weapons are really up 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.310
 your lowest point is if they are 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.290
 nobody wants to buy right now 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 I can not recommend slamming 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.520
 in most cases the price of weapons decreases 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.170
 still extremely that was with the last 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.000
 weapons or are they partially under 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.950
 60 gold dropped you have to stop 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.660
 have a little patience 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.320
 I personally like just this connection 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.180
 from engineering insect and some rough rami 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.510
 panic so you can see that here 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.980
 iron the metal at the weapons something 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.420
 coarser is I think the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.860
 shimmer effect very very nice 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.240
 we also have the effects here again 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.950
 that the weapons should be animated 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.700
 They have power lines which 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.560
 The wings are animated moving it 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.920
 there are rotating and twirling of the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.600
 Elements especially suitable of course 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.610
 now to my current sylvari 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.140
 here you can see the scepter here 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.760
 example has these rotating elements in 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.050
 the wings turn around 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.340
 and of course that you still have that 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.050
 Light effects also a bit 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.320
 are shocking as it living wing 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.730
 are 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.500
 I personally do not know it either 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.000
 how the weapons in different 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.160
 Light situations behave thereby now 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.520
 not so careful but that 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.780
 already has a lot of style 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.790
 when then the ambient light on 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.459
 this weapon adjusts the bar here 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.930
 I personally died personally 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.239
 little bit too big here 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.950
 you can see me who has a pretty 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.080
 big bar head but fits quite well 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.400
 is a sylvari the focus has 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.030
 now rather snail more similar 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.590
 held 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.760
 Of course you also have the weapons 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.890
 not so many design options 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.080
 to always make that extravagant 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.980
 where I just stop me 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.610
 torch and horn from time to time 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.420
 would 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.340
 you would the different ones 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.550
 possibilities to use these weapons 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.600
 make use of and then exploit 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.860
 flares sk the lights have here 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.900
 accordingly have blue if the 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.920
 form seen very often and that too 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.330
 horn is now different 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.709
 do not decide so blatantly now 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.600
 from all other gentlemen to whom we here 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.799
 in the game have the insect tank 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.940
 is it very interesting? 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.350
 I might have somehow now 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.790
 desired that there are two wings 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.690
 on the side because it is quite to the 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.370
 side would fit 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.470
 the shield is of course something 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.230
 special so there we are too 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.330
 already at the end 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.840
 there is still a new costume in the game 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.860
 in the jungle explorer that is 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.810
 also very interesting is one 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.490
 wardrobe clothes but otherwise means 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.650
 research it yourself again now 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.450
 play and then until next time 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.550
 at the next something 2 video either 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.710
 my living world the let's play 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.340
 or stop at the next update video until 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.340
 there at
