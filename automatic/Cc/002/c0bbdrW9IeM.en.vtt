taking a regular sheet of plywood cut

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.240 
taking a regular sheet of plywood cut
two<00:00:35.760> feet<00:00:35.970> off<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.360> we're<00:00:36.750> set<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:36.990> go<00:00:40.250> okay

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
now you can either do these murals just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.510 
now you can either do these murals just
gluing<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> straight<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.220> can<00:00:44.370> use<00:00:44.400> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
gluing it straight on or you can use a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330 
gluing it straight on or you can use a
grid<00:00:44.900> now<00:00:45.900> our<00:00:46.020> grid<00:00:46.290> is<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.830> be<00:00:46.890> done<00:00:47.070> by

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
grid now our grid is going to be done by

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
grid now our grid is going to be done by
making<00:00:47.550> four<00:00:48.030> inch<00:00:48.180> squares<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.050> we're<00:00:49.290> going

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
making four inch squares so we're going

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
making four inch squares so we're going
to<00:00:49.470> start<00:00:49.620> off<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> marking<00:00:50.340> touring<00:00:50.790> four

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to start off with a marking touring four

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:02.870 
to start off with a marking touring four
inches<00:00:51.420> across<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.950> 48

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.180 

okay<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.200> we<00:01:04.440> have<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> vertical<00:01:05.160> line

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
okay now that we have the vertical line

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.440 
okay now that we have the vertical line
we're<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.940> get<00:01:06.030> set<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
we're going to get set for the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
we're going to get set for the
horizontal<00:01:07.110> lines<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.950> 48<00:01:11.090> all<00:01:12.090> right<00:01:12.300> now

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
horizontal lines so 48 all right now

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
horizontal lines so 48 all right now
that<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:12.870> got<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.200> grid<00:01:13.440> we're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that we've got the grid we're going to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.650 
that we've got the grid we're going to
number<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> squares<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.510> where

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
number all the squares so we know where

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:29.300 
number all the squares so we know where
they're<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.110> okay<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:28.310> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
they're going to go okay here we go the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.420 
they're going to go okay here we go the
grip<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.210> effective<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.990> making<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> very

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
grip is very effective for making a very

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
grip is very effective for making a very
successful<00:01:32.760> class<00:01:33.390> project<00:01:34.080> this<00:01:34.830> allows<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
successful class project this allows the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.400 
successful class project this allows the
students<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> simply<00:01:36.570> follow<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> numbers<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
students to simply follow the numbers in

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.380 
students to simply follow the numbers in
the<00:01:37.440> book<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.860> randomly<00:01:38.790> put<00:01:39.060> those<00:01:39.180> words

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the book and randomly put those words

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.280 
the book and randomly put those words
down<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:40.140> create<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> art<00:01:42.140> cutting<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
down to create the art cutting out the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.930 
down to create the art cutting out the
images<00:01:43.410> is<00:01:43.710> easy<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.580> we're<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> do

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
images is easy so what we're going to do

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.130 
images is easy so what we're going to do
because<00:01:45.240> I'm<00:01:45.390> right-handed<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.080> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because I'm right-handed I'm going to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.910 
because I'm right-handed I'm going to
flip<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.440> book<00:01:46.560> around<00:01:47.300> grab<00:01:48.300> my<00:01:48.450> ruler

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
flip the book around grab my ruler

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.660 
flip the book around grab my ruler
you're<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.250> cut<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.550> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
you're going to want to cut on that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.660 
you're going to want to cut on that
black<00:01:51.000> line<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.600> yes<00:01:52.410> cut<00:01:52.860> directly<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.490> the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
cuts and that way you'll be to get all

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:15.559 
cuts and that way you'll be to get all
the<00:02:06.090> images<00:02:06.270> out<00:02:06.509> quite<00:02:07.020> easily<00:02:14.240> see<00:02:15.240> it's

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
the images out quite easily see it's

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.580 
the images out quite easily see it's
easy

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590

now so this book pretty much toast now
okay<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.769> fun<00:02:27.950> things<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.400> do

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
okay one of the fun things we like to do

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.630 
okay one of the fun things we like to do
is<00:02:28.730> maybe<00:02:28.760> shuffle<00:02:29.690> them<00:02:29.810> up<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:31.310> then<00:02:31.459> we<00:02:31.519> can

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
is maybe shuffle them up and then we can

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.550 
is maybe shuffle them up and then we can
put<00:02:31.760> them<00:02:31.879> on<00:02:31.970> randomly<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:33.140> it'll<00:02:33.260> be<00:02:33.290> more<00:02:33.470> of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
put them on randomly so it'll be more of

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.250 
put them on randomly so it'll be more of
an<00:02:33.650> interesting<00:02:33.950> class<00:02:34.099> for<00:02:34.430> kids<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.840> by

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
following the number guideline we can

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.910 
following the number guideline we can
randomly<00:02:38.569> place<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.900> squares<00:02:39.200> into<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.680> grid

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
randomly place the squares into the grid

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.390 
randomly place the squares into the grid
without<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.150> kids<00:02:41.360> knowing<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.069> final
