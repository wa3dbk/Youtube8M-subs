as<00:00:01.890> you<00:00:02.070> can<00:00:02.220> see<00:00:02.429> this<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.850> my<00:00:03.030> sweat<00:00:03.480> shop

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
as you can see this is my sweat shop

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.909 
as you can see this is my sweat shop
I've<00:00:04.259> got<00:00:04.640> so<00:00:05.640> many<00:00:06.109> card<00:00:07.109> sleeves<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.770> I've

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
I've got so many card sleeves that I've

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.850 
I've got so many card sleeves that I've
collected<00:00:08.099> over<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.870> course<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.380> channel

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
collected over the course of my channel

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
collected over the course of my channel
and<00:00:12.170> actually<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.469> probably<00:00:13.860> less<00:00:14.820> than

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and actually this is probably less than

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.700 
and actually this is probably less than
half<00:00:15.299> because<00:00:15.839> i'm<00:00:16.080> pretty<00:00:16.289> sure<00:00:16.410> i<00:00:16.440> throw

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
half because i'm pretty sure i throw

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.279 
half because i'm pretty sure i throw
away<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> whole<00:00:17.100> bunch<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.490> them<00:00:17.900> like<00:00:18.900> I'm<00:00:19.140> put

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
away a whole bunch of them like I'm put

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.570 
away a whole bunch of them like I'm put
a<00:00:19.320> shearing<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:20.010> supposed<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
a shearing and I'm supposed to have a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.400 
a shearing and I'm supposed to have a
lot<00:00:20.850> more<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.150> these<00:00:21.240> emerging<00:00:21.660> powers<00:00:22.080> but

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
lot more of these emerging powers but

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.189 
lot more of these emerging powers but
anyway<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> good<00:00:23.490> little<00:00:23.609> heap

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
anyway this is a good little heap

anyway this is a good little heap
especially<00:00:25.199> over<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.740> kind<00:00:25.949> of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
especially over here to kind of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.330 
especially over here to kind of
compacted<00:00:27.080> is<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> ones<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.830> used<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.310> on

so anyway I came up with this to a
little<00:00:40.140> emerging<00:00:40.680> powers<00:00:41.040> wallet<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.110> by

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
little emerging powers wallet and by

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
little emerging powers wallet and by
came<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> mean<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> made<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.030> not

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
came up with I mean that I made it not

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.139 
came up with I mean that I made it not
that<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> came<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.620> idea<00:00:46.850> since<00:00:47.850> these

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that I came up with the idea since these

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.660 
that I came up with the idea since these
have<00:00:48.210> been<00:00:48.360> floating<00:00:48.840> around<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.260> ages<00:00:49.670> as

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
have been floating around for ages as

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
have been floating around for ages as
you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:51.570> using<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.930> Doritos<00:00:52.739> bags

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.549 

testing<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> out<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:01.859> technique<00:01:03.409> trying<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
testing this out my technique trying to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.990 
testing this out my technique trying to
make<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.070> cool<00:01:05.400> looking<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
make it all cool looking and then I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.250 
make it all cool looking and then I
improved<00:01:09.000> upon<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.720> bit<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
improved upon it a little bit it's a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.750 
improved upon it a little bit it's a
little<00:01:10.290> smaller<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.280> next<00:01:12.000> destinies

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
little smaller this is next destinies

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
little smaller this is next destinies
still<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:15.869> wrinkly<00:01:16.259> than<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
still a little bit more wrinkly than I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160 
still a little bit more wrinkly than I
like<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.580> would<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.880> liked<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:19.049> at

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
like then I would have liked but at

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
like then I would have liked but at
least<00:01:19.290> doesn't<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.159> potato<00:01:20.729> chips<00:01:21.000> on

least doesn't have any potato chips on
the<00:01:21.299> inside<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.869> time<00:01:24.439> yep<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.770> I'll

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the inside this time yep and I'll

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
let's see which ones I can make okay I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.160 
let's see which ones I can make okay I
made<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.990> my

made one more you can see my
improvements<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.409> smoothest

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
improvements this one is the smoothest

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.730 
improvements this one is the smoothest
