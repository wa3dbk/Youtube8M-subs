00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.330
 therefore get off 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.580
 so that is 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.090
 I'm standing Fischer is just climbing again 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.710

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.310
 distant land 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.950
 and he found that leads more 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.180

 Well and whoever refuses to relax I am perfect for the divisions 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.610
 I draw the first stroke wonderfully and of course I have to insist 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.440
