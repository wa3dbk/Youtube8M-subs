her off I think if she has not hinted to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.470 
her off I think if she has not hinted to
it<00:03:21.349> like<00:03:21.470> whatsoever<00:03:21.860> not<00:03:22.760> she<00:03:23.000> she<00:03:23.360> hasn't

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
it like whatsoever not she she hasn't

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.410 
it like whatsoever not she she hasn't
shown<00:03:23.720> any<00:03:23.870> signs<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.650> wanting<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.700> go<00:03:25.940> there<00:03:26.150> i
