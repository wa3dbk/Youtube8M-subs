more<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> gluten<00:00:40.200> hamstring<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> can

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
more the gluten hamstring but you can

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
more the gluten hamstring but you can
also<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.640> bench<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.300> very<00:00:42.480> easy<00:00:42.600> way

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
also use a bench this is a very easy way

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
also use a bench this is a very easy way
for<00:00:43.800> them<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> understand<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.730> Q

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
for them to understand that Q

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.150 
for them to understand that Q
kinesthetically<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> foots<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
kinesthetically so the foots going to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.700 
kinesthetically so the foots going to
start<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.670> underneath<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> bench

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
start a little bit underneath the bench

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.680 
start a little bit underneath the bench
and<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.739> shin<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.390> against

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and the shin will actually up against

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
and the shin will actually up against
the<00:00:51.809> bench<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.559> start<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> half

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the bench I like to start in a half

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.610 
the bench I like to start in a half
kneeling<00:00:53.399> position<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.440> can

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
kneeling position from here they can

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.310 
kneeling position from here they can
kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.940> generate<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.449> stability<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
kind of generate the stability out of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
kind of generate the stability out of
the<00:00:58.410> bottom<00:00:58.770> rather<00:00:59.070> than<00:00:59.280> working<00:00:59.489> top<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the bottom rather than working top to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.569 
the bottom rather than working top to
bottom<00:01:00.800> again<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.949> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> find

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
bottom again we want to kind of find

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
bottom again we want to kind of find
that<00:01:02.820> tripod<00:01:03.270> foot<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.870> big<00:01:04.080> toe<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.890> toe

that tripod foot so big toe little toe
and<00:01:05.339> heel<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.570> about<00:01:06.659> pushing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and heel it's not just about pushing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
and heel it's not just about pushing
through<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.320> heel<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.430> forefoot<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
again from there once the athlete kind

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.389 
again from there once the athlete kind
of<00:01:44.880> grasps<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.869> vertical<00:01:46.409> Shin<00:01:46.619> concept<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
of grasps this vertical Shin concept and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.399 
of grasps this vertical Shin concept and
split<00:01:48.000> squats<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.390> fairly<00:01:48.570> easy<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.049> loaded

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
split squats are fairly easy you loaded

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.249 
split squats are fairly easy you loaded
that<00:01:49.439> him<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:50.149> now<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:51.930> progress

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that him up now we would then progress

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.929 
that him up now we would then progress
them<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> reverse<00:01:53.640> lunge

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
them to something like a reverse lunge

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.359 
them to something like a reverse lunge
with<00:01:54.600> dumbbells<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:56.040> kettlebells

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
holding its chest and goblins so that's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.859 
holding its chest and goblins so that's
two<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.729> go<00:01:59.850> split<00:02:00.149> squat<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> reverse

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
two we go split squat we get a reverse

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.389 
two we go split squat we get a reverse
lunge<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:02.780> then<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.990> might<00:02:04.170> work<00:02:04.439> more

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
lunge from there then we might work more

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.059 
lunge from there then we might work more
of<00:02:05.939> an<00:02:06.240> increase<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.780> range<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.079> motion<00:02:07.229> we

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
of an increase in the range of motion we

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.320 
of an increase in the range of motion we
might<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.399> rear<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:08.729> elevated<00:02:09.119> split

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
might go to rear for elevated split

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.100 
might go to rear for elevated split
squats<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:09.950> bulgarians<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> bar<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:12.209> we

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
squats or bulgarians with a bar or we

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.260 
squats or bulgarians with a bar or we
may<00:02:13.260> progressed<00:02:13.620> straight<00:02:13.890> into<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.430> forward

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
may progressed straight into a forward

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.800 
may progressed straight into a forward
lunch<00:02:16.250> walking<00:02:17.250> lunch<00:02:17.640> there<00:02:18.060> again<00:02:18.690> that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
lunch walking lunch there again that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.559 
lunch walking lunch there again that
would<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.989> more<00:02:19.110> quad<00:02:19.379> dominant<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.849> then

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
would be more quad dominant and then

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.070 
would be more quad dominant and then
finally<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.230> would<00:02:22.470> forward<00:02:23.129> lunge<00:02:23.959> back<00:02:24.959> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
finally you would forward lunge back to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.360 
finally you would forward lunge back to
the<00:02:25.140> initial<00:02:25.319> position<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:25.980> again<00:02:26.190> there's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the initial position so again there's

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.820 
the initial position so again there's
more<00:02:26.580> eccentric<00:02:27.540> loading<00:02:27.870> there<00:02:28.170> again<00:02:28.709> they

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
more eccentric loading there again they

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
more eccentric loading there again they
have<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.099> reverse<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> momentum<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.090> that's

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
have to reverse the momentum and that's

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.070 
have to reverse the momentum and that's
kind<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:30.959> your<00:02:31.080> final<00:02:31.379> progression<00:02:31.530> or<00:02:33.080> again

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
kind of your final progression or again

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.509 
kind of your final progression or again
you<00:02:34.110> move<00:02:34.410> into<00:02:34.530> riffat<00:02:34.920> other<00:02:35.040> way<00:02:35.160> split

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
you move into riffat other way split

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.630 
you move into riffat other way split

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.089 
extended position hip flexors are pretty
tight<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.659> we<00:02:57.720> got<00:02:57.870> an<00:02:57.930> anterior<00:02:58.409> tilt<00:02:58.650> so

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
tight so we got an anterior tilt so

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.479 
tight so we got an anterior tilt so
here's<00:02:59.879> a<00:03:00.000> drill<00:03:00.269> or<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:01.349> modification<00:03:02.099> that

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
here's a drill or a modification that

here's a drill or a modification that
I've<00:03:02.640> been<00:03:02.730> using<00:03:02.790> with<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.300> my

I've been using with a lot of my

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.600 
I've been using with a lot of my
athletes<00:03:03.690> again<00:03:04.230> I'll<00:03:05.040> start<00:03:05.340> them<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.519> the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
athletes again I'll start them with the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.210 
athletes again I'll start them with the
bench<00:03:05.790> started<00:03:06.180> from<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.330> bottom<00:03:06.390> up<00:03:06.810> now

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220

bench started from the bottom up now
we're<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.370> incorporate<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.819> little

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
we're going to incorporate a little

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.089 
we're going to incorporate a little
anterior<00:03:09.569> load<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.290> get<00:03:10.440> more<00:03:10.680> core

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
anterior load here so we get more core

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.479 
anterior load here so we get more core
engagement<00:03:11.720> coming<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> hole

engagement coming out of the hole

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.000 
engagement coming out of the hole
straight<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.849> down<00:03:15.500> again<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.739> nothing

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
straight up and down again it's nothing

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.350 
straight up and down again it's nothing
new<00:03:17.159> it's<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.670> different<00:03:17.849> way<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> load

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
new it's just a different way to load

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.750 
new it's just a different way to load
the<00:03:18.540> exercises<00:03:19.200> where<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.129> place<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.580> load

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
the exercises where you place the load

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.259 
the exercises where you place the load
determines<00:03:21.269> what<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.569> activated<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:23.269> you

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
determines what is activated so you

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.789 
determines what is activated so you
could<00:03:24.390> start<00:03:24.659> here<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:24.930> plate<00:03:25.349> you<00:03:25.560> can<00:03:25.680> use

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
could start here with plate you can use

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.020 
could start here with plate you can use
a<00:03:25.830> dumbbell<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.549> use<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.670> kettlebell
