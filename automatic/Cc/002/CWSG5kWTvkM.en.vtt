00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.080
 what's up kids like you are 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.190
 welcome to a video of with your king and 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.170
 as you can see we are here in the 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.240
 consortium and as you see in the title what 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.000
 more like soul more like the 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.430
 hb r3 insanity that there is right now in the 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.830
 advanced warfighter that is already from 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.910
 yes that is a model is a model and it is the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.250
 that you are seeing right now in the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.169
 screen that is the hdr to three ryder that 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.480
 since we will discuss it below 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.800
 the characteristics and so on but first 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.330
 kids in the background I'll be watching some 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.890
 more striped clips 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.440
 for example on this map we are in the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.960
 map of rivers how good it took me 715 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.879
 I think it was and good to say that I was the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.379
 last night playing and saying I have 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.510
 to get me a run for those of 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.699
 tomorrow but nothing came out nothing came out 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.710
 in plan powerful nothing in plan a fierce 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.510
 ferocious has not fallen any but yes that 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.339
 you dared the powerful I think in 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.470
 this map I some streak of 15 and in the 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.420
 next you're going to see a streak of 20 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.610
 which is pretty good and say 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.770
 you're going to see only clipped parts 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.690
 so you really see the potential of 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.940
 that weapon you are not going to see parts where I 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.610
 I start to run in plan to run to throw 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.770
 the ub do whatever it is just going to see 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.180
 where where he killed is worth so that 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.860
 really see what you can 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.150
 Christian and the potential of this weapon 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.370
 but good guys let's start 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.070
 directly with the video as I said 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.870
 previously this model is the ryder 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.580
 it's worth to this one 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.200
 in quite pretty similar models 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.570
 in saint seiya you will see below 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.060
 why but I say that it bursts a lot 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.980
 or it bursts that is not normal and is 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.210
 quite comparable with in saint and so 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.010
 Well then we go with the cards 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.320
 As you can see here I have the card 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.230
 and how can you see what goes up is the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.060
 first one takes away one of precision 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.370
 but then it's up 1 of 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.530
 cadence is worth one of lack and it rises 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.080
 one of mobility this dot one of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.580
 cadences very but that very in favor for 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.320
 this weapon and as you can see right now 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.090
 on the insight card and so that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.250
 compare here as you can see the in 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.860
 sainz and you come up already we started powerful one 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.440
 damage adds two cadence and 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.140
 subtract one from mobility and I tell you that 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.570
 they are not exactly the same, but it is 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.280
 the closest thing that there is right now in 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.050
 the advanced war and as I said that's why 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.510
 not in the title that's why I'm not going to put 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.000
 how to convert this language and sainz arrived 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.920
 turn another into another and zanetti but 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.450
 that I am going to put you is the closest thing to 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.550
 in saint and say that this one also 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.140
 bust quite quite enough the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.510
 little point of this decadence what we 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.310
 allows to do is to shorten distances 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.260
 let's dig pretty pretty well but 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.750
 in we have much better than with a 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.340
 with the normal chÃ©vere obviously the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.769
 tool incident even more but I os 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.439
 I say that this is the closest thing to the 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.750
 saint and from what I 've read out there the 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.549
 cadence of this weapon the cadence of the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.390
 ryder and the insanity are exactly 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.310
 same 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.860
 the first tiritos it because 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.569
 you know that the first shots are 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.790
 quickest are the bullets come out with 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.500
 more more quickly more bullets by 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.299
 minutes or per second as what it is 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.920
 call so well is because Caustic 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.480
 a pretty good enough weapon bursts 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.340
 quite right now we are on the map 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.140
 of solar as you can see I really 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.379
 when he touched me or not very felipe or anything 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.720
 in plan vigo others others more for me os 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.430
 not anal but then I put it on worth 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.650
 I tried on the shooting range I saw that 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.450
 they burst enough, then I put it on 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.730
 in a middle class has a departure 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.739
 public to howard and my mother what 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.569
 bust clear be flippin meme 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.940
 I'm in love with this weapon because it really is 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.340
 very, very similar to the moment and 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.750
 it is very much more affordable by the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.760
 players since there are many more 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.010
 chances of him touching on insight and 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.480
 because this is a professional model and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.669
 you know that the different one is a model 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.920
 elite with which this weapon is much more 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.900
 easy to touch you in supply 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.900
 that is to say that as we have seen normal as well 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.880
 that I did not spend money on this weapon 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.090
 we could say and well then I tell you 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.230
 there are many possibilities that you touch 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.880
 also also that more than more 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.890
 which is better, well let's proceed 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.930
 with how I have this class that I 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.220
 He forgot to comment on how he's behaved. 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.650
 important that you take it as I take it 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.720
 me because if not say that these 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.880
 These are the best accessories for 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.720
 this weapon according to my point of view like this 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.000
 that's good, as you can see 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.890
 hilt very but very important 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.319
 because without a handle that little bit of 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.300
 handling or not those of precision forgiveness that 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.700
 removes it on the handle 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.609
 it resets and on top one more of 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.350
 of precision and it really helps a lot 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.880
 because without the hilt the weapon is going 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.130
 for basin then also has 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.320
 unsheathed that is essential for 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.120
 I already optical to taste the colors and 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.010
 basically because I like to have 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.110
 a lot of agility with the weapon with which 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.300
 he unsheathed what he does is that 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.070
 let's aim a lot faster and for 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.450
 last loaders extended because I was 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.910
 forgot to comment that this model 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.590
 removes one of chargers with which with 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.560
 Extended chargers and alarms stays 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.479
 in 39 in rods with which is perfect 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.820
 valuable extended chargers we have to 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.320
 to be able to read yes or yes, so nothing 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.180
 kids up here the video today 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.620
 I hope you liked it and I tell you it is 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.990
 a pretty pretty similar weapon 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.030
 our insanity is worth it because I've seen 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.610
 videos out there that say how to convert 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.610
 in more picky yes how to turn it into another 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.200
 goliat not gone not just this 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.240
 weapon is the closest thing there is now 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.640
 same advance wars line sainz and ya os 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.350
 I say that it bursts a lot but a lot 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.900
 that is really the PSNI and put yourself if 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.789
 If you have it, we put it in and you go 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.020
 to see what bursts a lot is that a 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.340
 some guys to see if we can get to 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.350
 about 100 likes for this video what 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.490
 they would appreciate quite so national 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.229
 is here podium and I hope that I have 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.229
 liked a greeting guys and see you
