00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
important I think having trees in the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.289 
important I think having trees in the
environment<00:03:22.530> which<00:03:23.459> urban<00:03:23.819> planners<00:03:24.150> have

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
always done since Greek times really I

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.490 
always done since Greek times really I
mean<00:03:26.790> if<00:03:26.909> you<00:03:27.000> look<00:03:27.120> at<00:03:27.239> even<00:03:27.900> bases<00:03:28.319> like

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
mean if you look at even bases like

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.580 
mean if you look at even bases like
Pompeii<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.519> can<00:03:29.849> see<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.870> Roman<00:03:31.230> building

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
Pompeii you can see in in Roman building

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.530

where<00:03:32.280> they've<00:03:32.430> used<00:03:32.579> plants<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.209> over<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
where they've used plants in over the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.640 
where they've used plants in over the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
streets and I think there's a very good

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.800 
streets and I think there's a very good
reason<00:03:37.980> about<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:38.700> does<00:03:38.940> improve

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
reason about that it does improve

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.580 
reason about that it does improve

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
well-being we know that trees provide so

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.770 
well-being we know that trees provide so
much<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:44.069> our<00:03:44.220> city<00:03:44.459> whether<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.329> shelter
