saw just trying to get this thing out of
its<00:00:15.809> locked<00:00:16.109> position<00:00:18.350> now<00:00:19.350> compound<00:00:20.160> meaning

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
its locked position now compound meaning

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
its locked position now compound meaning
that<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.359> does<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> special<00:00:21.930> kind<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.710> does<00:00:22.859> a

special kind of cut here let me show you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.049 
special kind of cut here let me show you
loosen<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> little<00:00:30.800> right<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.910> would

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
loosen a little right here you would

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.120 
loosen a little right here you would
primarily<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.290> probably<00:00:34.739> use<00:00:34.950> like

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
primarily you you probably use like

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.010 
primarily you you probably use like
compound<00:00:35.760> cuts<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.540> doing<00:00:36.809> any<00:00:36.930> kind

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
compound cuts when you're doing any kind

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.290 
compound cuts when you're doing any kind
of<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> construction<00:00:38.460> work<00:00:38.850> doing

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
of like a construction work doing

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.690 
of like a construction work doing
rafters<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> stuff<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.579> can

see<00:00:42.620> pretty<00:00:43.620> much<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.920> compound<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
see pretty much all compound is is that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.880 
see pretty much all compound is is that
you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:47.420> pretty<00:00:48.420> much<00:00:48.539> tilt<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> actual<00:00:49.559> saw

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you can pretty much tilt the actual saw

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.490 
you can pretty much tilt the actual saw
itself<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:51.440> an<00:00:52.440> angle<00:00:52.800> which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> nice

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
itself in an angle which is kind of nice

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.250 
itself in an angle which is kind of nice
especially<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.960> we're<00:00:57.960> doing

aluminum fence now this is kind of like

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
aluminum fence now this is kind of like
your<00:01:23.369> basic<00:01:23.640> type<00:01:24.090> model<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.780> mean<00:01:24.960> there's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
your basic type model I mean there's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.429 
your basic type model I mean there's
tons<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.619> models<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.900> where<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.290> can

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
tons of models out there where you can

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
tons of models out there where you can
go<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:28.909> 12-inch<00:01:31.939> which<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> larger<00:01:33.479> size

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
go from 12-inch which is larger size

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.910 
go from 12-inch which is larger size
blade<00:01:34.310> or<00:01:35.780> or<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:36.990> go<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.320> dual

blade or or you can go with a dual
compound<00:01:38.700> which<00:01:39.270> means<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.900> compound

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
compound which means you can do compound

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.460 
compound which means you can do compound
on<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.640> side<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.659> side<00:01:42.990> or

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
on this side and also on that side or

on this side and also on that side or
you<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> sliding<00:01:45.149> compound<00:01:45.840> miter<00:01:46.200> saw

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you can get a sliding compound miter saw

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.420 
you can get a sliding compound miter saw
which<00:01:46.950> has<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> rail<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.780> sticks<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.740> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
which has a rail that sticks out here so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.359 
which has a rail that sticks out here so
you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.119> start<00:01:52.049> plunge<00:01:52.619> down<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.189> it

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you can actually start plunge down on it

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.380 
you can actually start plunge down on it
and<00:01:53.670> actually<00:01:54.060> pull<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.560> saw<00:01:55.560> towards<00:01:56.159> you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
and actually pull the saw towards you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.230 
and actually pull the saw towards you
which<00:01:57.390> creates<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> nicer<00:01:58.200> cut<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.240> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
which creates a nicer cut for it you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
which creates a nicer cut for it you
know<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.990> depends<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.560> your

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
know it just really depends on your

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.120 
know it just really depends on your
application<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.719> me<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.320> I'm

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
application I think for me I just do I'm

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.510 
application I think for me I just do I'm
doing<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.759> basic<00:02:06.299> trim<00:02:06.600> work<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:08.399> know

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
doing like basic trim work and you know

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520 
doing like basic trim work and you know
I<00:02:08.550> use<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.119> when<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.720> fencing<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
I use this when I do my fencing and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.280 
I use this when I do my fencing and
stuff<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
stuff like that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.800 
stuff like that
it's<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.440> nice<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.550> nice<00:02:14.700> miter<00:02:15.060> saw<00:02:15.360> for

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
it's a nice it's a nice miter saw for

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's a nice it's a nice miter saw for
what<00:02:16.080> I'm<00:02:16.200> using<00:02:16.440> before<00:02:16.820> it's<00:02:17.820> got<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.840> does

have a laser as you can see right here

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.830 
have a laser as you can see right here
this<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.680> laser<00:02:22.890> itself<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:27.690> this

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
this is the laser itself with this
