this<00:00:00.089> is<00:00:00.210> a<00:00:00.240> quick<00:00:00.539> video<00:00:00.930> another<00:00:01.500> one<00:00:01.709> just

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
this is a quick video another one just

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.400 
this is a quick video another one just
to<00:00:01.979> show<00:00:02.070> wide<00:00:02.909> view<00:00:03.300> working<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.959> best<00:00:04.170> I've

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
to show wide view working the best I've

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.019 
to show wide view working the best I've
ever<00:00:04.440> seen<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.549> I've<00:00:05.640> got<00:00:05.819> everything

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
ever seen it so I've got everything

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.240 
ever seen it so I've got everything
display<00:00:06.690> wise<00:00:06.960> completely<00:00:07.560> turned<00:00:07.830> down<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.189> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
display wise completely turned down to a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.250 
display wise completely turned down to a
minimum<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.210> all<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.690> sliders<00:00:10.139> are

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
minimum so all the sliders are

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.530 
minimum so all the sliders are
completely<00:00:10.679> down<00:00:11.030> I'll<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.090> quickly<00:00:12.420> go

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
completely down I'll just quickly go

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.880 
completely down I'll just quickly go
into<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.960> display<00:00:13.380> settings<00:00:14.210> options

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
into the display settings options

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.689 
into the display settings options
display<00:00:17.029> just<00:00:18.029> showing<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.900> I've<00:00:19.170> got

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
display just showing in here so I've got

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.640 
display just showing in here so I've got
filtering<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.789> set<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.150> none<00:00:21.680> 102<00:00:22.680> 4<00:00:23.189> by<00:00:23.369> 7<00:00:23.430> 6<00:00:23.880> 8

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
filtering is set to none 102 4 by 7 6 8

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.450 
filtering is set to none 102 4 by 7 6 8
go<00:00:25.650> through<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> sliders<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.939> down<00:00:27.180> down

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
go through the sliders all down down

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.709 
go through the sliders all down down
down<00:00:29.480> down<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.859> basically<00:00:32.719> putting

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
down down so this is basically putting

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.049 
down down so this is basically putting
the<00:00:33.930> minimal<00:00:34.410> amount<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.829> graphics<00:00:35.309> tax<00:00:35.640> on

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the minimal amount of graphics tax on

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.600 
the minimal amount of graphics tax on
the<00:00:36.239> computer<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.680> order<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the computer in order to kind of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.450 
the computer in order to kind of
simulate<00:00:39.030> having<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.660> very<00:00:39.870> high<00:00:40.050> spec<00:00:40.410> PC<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
simulate having a very high spec PC to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.020 
simulate having a very high spec PC to
handle<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> graphics<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.850> what<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> want

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
handle the graphics and so what I want

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.670 
handle the graphics and so what I want
to<00:00:45.120> prove<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.809> wide<00:00:45.989> view<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.440> work

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to prove is just that wide view can work

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.639 
to prove is just that wide view can work
smoothly<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.899> possible<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> get

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
smoothly and that it is possible to get

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.910 
smoothly and that it is possible to get
a<00:00:49.890> good<00:00:50.610> reaction<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> client<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.649> I've

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
a good reaction from the client so I've

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
a good reaction from the client so I've
got<00:00:53.039> everything<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:54.570> else<00:00:54.690> we've<00:00:54.870> got

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
got everything down what else we've got

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.080 
got everything down what else we've got
so<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.690> server<00:00:57.690> settings

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
so if I go into the server settings

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.840 
so if I go into the server settings
configuration<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> I've<00:01:02.730> got

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
configuration you can see that I've got

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.299 
configuration you can see that I've got
it<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.030> Macs<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.379> default<00:01:04.739> settings<00:01:05.220> here

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it on Macs and the default settings here

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.230 
it on Macs and the default settings here
and<00:01:05.810> all<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.650> CPUs<00:01:08.280> are<00:01:08.430> selected<00:01:08.939> for

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and all of the CPUs are selected for

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.960 
and all of the CPUs are selected for
wide<00:01:09.659> view<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.220> nothing<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
wide view so there's nothing out the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
wide view so there's nothing out the
ordinary<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> server<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.799> go

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
ordinary there for the server they go

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
ordinary there for the server they go
across<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> client<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> left

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
across to the client which is the left

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.830 
across to the client which is the left
monitor<00:01:16.400> again<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.850> sliders<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
monitor again all the sliders and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
monitor again all the sliders and
display<00:01:19.380> settings<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:20.070> set<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> an<00:01:20.520> absolute

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
display settings are set to an absolute

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
display settings are set to an absolute
minimum<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.689> fsx

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
minimum in fsx

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
minimum in fsx
I've<00:01:22.950> even<00:01:23.490> got<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.729> 16-bit<00:01:24.390> color<00:01:24.830> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I've even got it on 16-bit color the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.170 
I've even got it on 16-bit color the
difference<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.790> into<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
difference here if I go into the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.219 
difference here if I go into the
configuration<00:01:27.630> settings<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.680> wide<00:01:29.340> view<00:01:30.229> I'm

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
configuration settings for wide view I'm

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
configuration settings for wide view I'm
using<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.100> Intel<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> smooth<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.150> until

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
using the Intel a smooth and up until

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.910 
using the Intel a smooth and up until
now<00:01:33.630> we've<00:01:33.810> never<00:01:33.960> been<00:01:34.170> able<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> use<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
now we've never been able to use this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
now we've never been able to use this
because<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> lag<00:01:35.579> has<00:01:36.000> been<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> three<00:01:36.479> or

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
because of the lag has been a three or

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
because of the lag has been a three or
four<00:01:36.720> second<00:01:37.140> lag<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.470> I've<00:01:37.590> managed<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> find

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
four second lag but I've managed to find

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.280 
four second lag but I've managed to find
settings<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:38.820> allows<00:01:39.540> us<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> use<00:01:39.960> until

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
settings which allows us to use until

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.830 
settings which allows us to use until
you<00:01:40.409> smooth<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.759> reacting<00:01:42.000> very<00:01:42.479> good

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you smooth and it is reacting very good

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.109 
you smooth and it is reacting very good
so<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> moment<00:01:43.829> I've<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.159> selected<00:01:44.310> set

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
so the moment I've got it selected set

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
so the moment I've got it selected set
to<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> hundred<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> deselect<00:01:46.259> o'clock<00:01:46.829> to

to a hundred of deselect o'clock to
frame<00:01:47.310> sync<00:01:47.700> I've<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.350> highest

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.770

I'm at Heathrow so remember these

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.750 
I'm at Heathrow so remember these
servers<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.890> right<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.250> client<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.640> on

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
servers on the right the client is on

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000 
servers on the right the client is on
the<00:02:25.849> left<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.480> I'm<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.260> gonna<00:02:27.380> spool<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.890> up

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the left and I'm just gonna spool it up

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.070 
the left and I'm just gonna spool it up
and<00:02:28.280> try<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.120> keep<00:02:29.239> an<00:02:29.450> eye<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.750> runway

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and try and keep an eye on the runway

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.240 
and try and keep an eye on the runway
because<00:02:30.200> that's<00:02:30.440> normally<00:02:30.560> where<00:02:30.860> we<00:02:31.010> get<00:02:31.160> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
because that's normally where we get the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.120 
because that's normally where we get the
stutters<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.030> also<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.170> these<00:02:33.410> four<00:02:33.709> runway

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
stutters and also on these four runway

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.100 
stutters and also on these four runway
lights<00:02:34.370> because<00:02:34.670> they<00:02:34.819> indicate<00:02:35.239> quite<00:02:35.930> well

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
lights because they indicate quite well

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.259 
lights because they indicate quite well
on<00:02:36.140> their<00:02:36.440> stutters<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.519> I'm<00:02:37.580> gonna<00:02:37.670> fire<00:02:38.000> up

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
on their stutters so I'm gonna fire up

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.110 
on their stutters so I'm gonna fire up
to<00:02:38.300> maximum<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.280> can<00:02:40.459> see<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.700> server<00:02:40.970> is

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
to maximum so you can see the server is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.550 
to maximum so you can see the server is
nice<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.510> smooth<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.019> by<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.170> way<00:02:42.380> I've<00:02:42.530> got

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
nice and smooth and by the way I've got

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.039 
nice and smooth and by the way I've got
the<00:02:43.010> frames<00:02:43.459> per<00:02:43.700> second<00:02:44.060> set<00:02:44.239> on<00:02:44.360> both<00:02:44.540> pcs

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
the frames per second set on both pcs

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.320 
the frames per second set on both pcs
2:30<00:02:45.560> at<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:45.860> moment<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.880> let's<00:02:47.000> look<00:02:47.120> at<00:02:47.269> the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
2:30 at the moment so let's look at the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.910 
2:30 at the moment so let's look at the
runway<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.049> client

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.830 

so<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.850> running<00:02:53.180> gneisses<00:02:53.600> look<00:02:53.750> at

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
so that is running gneisses look at

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.630 
so that is running gneisses look at
those<00:02:53.930> lights<00:02:54.260> nice<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:55.010> smooth<00:02:55.310> not<00:02:55.610> a

single judder nice smooth tarmac if we
look<00:02:59.900> at<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.080> tarmac<00:03:00.470> moving<00:03:00.890> on<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> server

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
look at the tarmac moving on the server

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.940 
look at the tarmac moving on the server
and<00:03:02.450> then<00:03:02.600> on<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> client<00:03:03.319> we<00:03:03.440> can<00:03:03.590> see<00:03:03.800> it's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
and then on the client we can see it's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.550 
and then on the client we can see it's
nice<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.370> smooth<00:03:05.410> okay<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.810> I'm<00:03:08.900> gonna<00:03:09.050> fly<00:03:09.380> up

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.210 

okay<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:37.930> knows<00:03:38.110> planted<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.770> into<00:03:39.069> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
okay just knows planted it into the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.250 
okay just knows planted it into the
tarmac

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.350 

as<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.040> can<00:03:44.159> see<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.519> colors<00:03:44.819> are<00:03:44.879> very<00:03:45.120> basic

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
as you can see the colors are very basic

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.539 
as you can see the colors are very basic
but<00:03:45.959> again<00:03:46.260> that's<00:03:46.439> just<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> simulate<00:03:47.040> some

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
but again that's just to simulate some

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.119 
but again that's just to simulate some
some<00:03:48.450> i7<00:03:49.049> power<00:03:49.319> I've<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:49.650> turned<00:03:49.860> all<00:03:50.040> the

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
some i7 power I've just turned all the

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.910 
some i7 power I've just turned all the
sliders<00:03:50.610> down<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.390> server<00:03:51.659> is<00:03:52.019> an<00:03:52.200> i-5<00:03:52.620> my

before<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.099> had<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.280> delay<00:04:05.549> let<00:04:05.790> me<00:04:05.879> show<00:04:06.060> you

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
before we had to delay let me show you

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.580 
before we had to delay let me show you
what<00:04:06.269> happens<00:04:06.540> when<00:04:06.629> I<00:04:06.720> pause<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:06.989> how<00:04:07.319> quick

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
what happens when I pause it how quick

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.250 
what happens when I pause it how quick
the<00:04:07.680> client<00:04:07.980> stops<00:04:11.329> it's<00:04:12.329> virtually<00:04:12.870> instant

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
the client stops it's virtually instant

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.809 
the client stops it's virtually instant
and<00:04:13.500> actually<00:04:13.859> I<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.129> tune<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.670> be<00:04:14.790> a

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
and actually I can tune that to be a

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.330 
and actually I can tune that to be a
little<00:04:15.060> bit<00:04:15.180> quicker<00:04:15.390> but<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.799> honest<00:04:17.100> it's

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
little bit quicker but to be honest it's

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.060 
little bit quicker but to be honest it's
it's<00:04:17.669> unnoticeable<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.289> reaction<00:04:19.829> time

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
it's unnoticeable the reaction time

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.860 
it's unnoticeable the reaction time
between<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.760> server<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> client

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.740 

so<00:04:27.470> there<00:04:27.620> we<00:04:27.710> go
