now where do those you know certain
monsters<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.230> creatures<00:03:43.590> come<00:03:43.799> from<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.220> mean

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
monsters the creatures come from I mean

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.490 
monsters the creatures come from I mean
it's<00:03:44.910> yet<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.299> explained<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.019> wonder

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
it's yet to be explained so I wonder

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.039 
it's yet to be explained so I wonder
where<00:03:47.069> they<00:03:47.250> count<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.639> came<00:03:47.849> from<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.389> you

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
where they count it came from and you

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.990 
where they count it came from and you
know<00:03:49.290> what<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:49.799> are<00:03:50.069> that's<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.849> big

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
know what they are that's the big

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.069 
know what they are that's the big
question<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.329> have<00:03:51.450> right<00:03:51.630> now

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
question I have right now

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.559 
question I have right now
now<00:03:52.500> we<00:03:53.010> also<00:03:53.190> get<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.519> see<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.760> first<00:03:54.060> glance<00:03:54.329> at

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
now we also get to see a first glance at

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.900 
now we also get to see a first glance at
a<00:03:54.900> vampire<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.859> instance<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.190> vampire<00:03:56.549> in<00:03:56.760> this

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
a vampire for instance a vampire in this

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.659 
a vampire for instance a vampire in this
episode<00:03:57.299> escapes<00:03:57.690> like<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> biological

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
episode escapes like a biological

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.250 
episode escapes like a biological
testing<00:03:59.669> facility<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.480> our<00:04:00.870> main<00:04:01.049> male

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
testing facility and our main male

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.259 
testing facility and our main male
character<00:04:01.590> has<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.769> go<00:04:02.069> up<00:04:02.310> against<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
character has to go up against this

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.720 
character has to go up against this
vampire<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.290> test<00:04:04.650> his<00:04:04.799> skills<00:04:05.040> against<00:04:05.579> her

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
vampire and test his skills against her

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.460 
vampire and test his skills against her
but<00:04:06.269> from<00:04:06.389> what<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:06.690> could<00:04:06.840> see<00:04:07.019> he's<00:04:07.290> not

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
but from what you could see he's not

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.559 
but from what you could see he's not
that<00:04:07.709> strong<00:04:08.069> enough<00:04:08.370> yet<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.970> really<00:04:09.329> take

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
that strong enough yet to really take

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.930 
that strong enough yet to really take
down<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.810> vampire<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:11.040> he<00:04:11.129> was<00:04:11.340> holding<00:04:11.819> his

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
down a vampire but he was holding his

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.879 
down a vampire but he was holding his
own<00:04:12.030> he<00:04:12.299> did<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.660> lot<00:04:12.900> better<00:04:13.109> job<00:04:13.169> holding<00:04:13.739> his

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
own he did a lot better job holding his

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.199 
own he did a lot better job holding his
own<00:04:13.949> compared<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.370> how<00:04:14.489> he<00:04:14.549> was<00:04:14.760> when<00:04:14.940> he<00:04:15.030> was<00:04:15.150> a

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
own compared to how he was when he was a

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.460 
own compared to how he was when he was a
kid<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:15.419> mean<00:04:15.599> if<00:04:15.720> we<00:04:15.810> compare<00:04:16.139> in<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.289> last

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
kid I mean if we compare in the last

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.589 
kid I mean if we compare in the last
episode<00:04:16.949> when<00:04:17.370> he<00:04:17.459> was<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.639> kid<00:04:17.880> he<00:04:18.329> couldn't

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
episode when he was a kid he couldn't

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.449 
episode when he was a kid he couldn't
even<00:04:18.660> stand<00:04:18.989> up<00:04:19.199> to<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.410> vampire<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.099> this

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
even stand up to a vampire but in this

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.370 
even stand up to a vampire but in this
episode<00:04:20.910> at<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.090> very<00:04:21.329> least<00:04:21.539> he<00:04:21.989> was<00:04:22.109> kind<00:04:22.289> of

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
episode at the very least he was kind of

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.740 
episode at the very least he was kind of
holding<00:04:22.650> his<00:04:22.770> own<00:04:22.860> but<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.849> can<00:04:23.880> consider

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
holding his own but you can consider

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.940 
holding his own but you can consider
this<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.349> vampire<00:04:25.800> was<00:04:26.190> incredibly

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
this so the vampire was incredibly

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.550 
this so the vampire was incredibly
because<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:28.120> vampire<00:04:28.510> was<00:04:28.690> in<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.900> biological

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
because this vampire was in a biological

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.290 
because this vampire was in a biological
testing<00:04:29.890> facility<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:30.640> you<00:04:30.700> can<00:04:30.880> assume<00:04:31.270> that

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
testing facility so you can assume that

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.360 
testing facility so you can assume that
the<00:04:31.690> vampire<00:04:32.020> was<00:04:32.170> starved<00:04:32.590> for<00:04:32.710> blood<00:04:32.950> the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
the vampire was starved for blood the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.190 
the vampire was starved for blood the
vampire<00:04:33.400> barely<00:04:34.030> had<00:04:34.150> any<00:04:34.390> blood<00:04:34.690> at<00:04:34.720> all<00:04:34.930> and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
vampire barely had any blood at all and

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.440 
vampire barely had any blood at all and
so<00:04:35.860> this<00:04:36.070> vampire<00:04:36.460> was<00:04:36.700> weakened<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.210> not<00:04:37.300> at

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
so this vampire was weakened and not at

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.740 
so this vampire was weakened and not at
maximum<00:04:37.900> strength<00:04:38.290> so<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:40.150> main<00:04:40.300> mode<00:04:40.480> kicker

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
maximum strength so the main mode kicker

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.180 
maximum strength so the main mode kicker
has<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> lot<00:04:41.080> of<00:04:41.200> improvement<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.740> do<00:04:41.890> because

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
has a lot of improvement to do because

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.490 
has a lot of improvement to do because
he<00:04:42.310> really<00:04:42.850> couldn't<00:04:43.090> even<00:04:43.390> beat<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:43.930> vampire

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
he really couldn't even beat a vampire

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.680 
he really couldn't even beat a vampire
that<00:04:44.680> wasn't<00:04:45.070> even<00:04:45.220> at<00:04:45.310> full<00:04:45.490> strength<00:04:45.880> so

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
that wasn't even at full strength so

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.960 
that wasn't even at full strength so
