the moon will mix Matt Stafford a solid
quarterback<00:01:05.950> it's<00:01:06.340> his<00:01:06.520> tremendous<00:01:06.960> superior

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
quarterback it's his tremendous superior

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.410 
quarterback it's his tremendous superior
arm<00:01:08.290> strength<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.009> he<00:01:09.220> can<00:01:09.399> beat<00:01:09.640> press<00:01:09.970> he

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
arm strength and he can beat press he

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.090 
arm strength and he can beat press he
could<00:01:10.540> be<00:01:10.690> coverages<00:01:11.200> he<00:01:11.380> could<00:01:11.530> be<00:01:11.619> blitzes

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
could be coverages he could be blitzes

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.100 
could be coverages he could be blitzes
with<00:01:12.369> his<00:01:12.550> arm<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.360> think<00:01:13.600> he<00:01:13.720> can<00:01:13.840> throw

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110

sprint out past all here and we're going

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.219 
sprint out past all here and we're going
to<00:01:18.100> show<00:01:18.220> how<00:01:18.400> he<00:01:18.460> can<00:01:18.700> beat<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.060> press<00:01:19.570> with

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
to show how he can beat the press with

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.200 
to show how he can beat the press with
the<00:01:20.530> sprint<00:01:20.890> out<00:01:21.070> let's<00:01:21.670> just<00:01:21.909> have<00:01:22.060> this

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
ability to take off and run so now you

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.400 
ability to take off and run so now you
give<00:04:49.310> yourself<00:04:49.430> three<00:04:50.030> options<00:04:50.570> in<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:51.230> red

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
give yourself three options in the red

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.470 
give yourself three options in the red
zone<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.860> could<00:04:52.010> pay<00:04:52.190> off<00:04:52.400> with<00:04:52.970> seven

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
zone that could pay off with seven

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.410 
zone that could pay off with seven
instead<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.170> three<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:57.880> think<00:04:58.880> bill<00:04:59.060> Bentley

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
instead of three I think bill Bentley

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.000 
instead of three I think bill Bentley
has<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.720> be<00:04:59.840> an<00:04:59.930> x-factor<00:05:00.260> he's<00:05:00.620> gonna<00:05:00.770> get<00:05:00.890> the

has to be an x-factor he's gonna get the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.620 
has to be an x-factor he's gonna get the
bulk<00:05:01.190> of<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.340> passes<00:05:01.700> coming<00:05:02.090> his<00:05:02.240> way<00:05:02.420> as

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
bulk of the passes coming his way as

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.690 
bulk of the passes coming his way as
they<00:05:03.200> go<00:05:03.350> away<00:05:03.470> from<00:05:03.800> Chris<00:05:04.010> Houston<00:05:04.310> so<00:05:04.580> he

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
they go away from Chris Houston so he

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.790

defense<00:05:18.410> for<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.590> Bears<00:05:23.110> now<00:05:24.110> let's<00:05:24.320> look<00:05:24.440> at

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
defense for the Bears now let's look at

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.170 
defense for the Bears now let's look at
the<00:05:24.680> personnel<00:05:25.160> breakdown<00:05:25.610> in<00:05:25.820> this<00:05:25.940> ballgame

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
the personnel breakdown in this ballgame

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.700 
the personnel breakdown in this ballgame
you<00:05:26.510> look<00:05:26.660> at<00:05:26.780> where<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.080> Lions<00:05:27.260> have<00:05:27.560> the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
you look at where the Lions have the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.230 
you look at where the Lions have the
advantage<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.250> offensive<00:05:28.640> line<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:29.090> in<00:05:29.150> a

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
advantage the offensive line and in a

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.970 
advantage the offensive line and in a
tight<00:05:29.450> end<00:05:29.630> position<00:05:29.690> I<00:05:30.140> think<00:05:30.380> utilizing<00:05:30.919> the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
tight end position I think utilizing the

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.500 
tight end position I think utilizing the
tight<00:05:31.190> ends<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.580> week<00:05:31.820> versus<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.300> Bears

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
tight ends this week versus the Bears

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.510 
tight ends this week versus the Bears
gives<00:05:33.080> them<00:05:33.290> an<00:05:33.410> advantage<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.890> control<00:05:34.370> the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
gives them an advantage to control the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.590 
gives them an advantage to control the
middle<00:05:34.760> of<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:34.880> field<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.210> that's<00:05:35.270> what<00:05:35.450> you

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
middle of the field and that's what you

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.180 
middle of the field and that's what you
have<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:35.840> do<00:05:36.080> when<00:05:36.440> you're<00:05:36.560> facing<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:37.010> rod

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
have to do when you're facing the rod

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:44.290 
have to do when you're facing the rod
marinelli<00:05:37.430> defense<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:42.550> like<00:05:43.550> Chicago<00:05:44.060> in<00:05:44.150> this

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
marinelli defense I like Chicago in this

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.970 
marinelli defense I like Chicago in this
ballgame<00:05:44.510> you<00:05:44.810> look<00:05:44.930> at<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.169> ability<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.800> run

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980

the<00:05:46.130> football<00:05:46.280> control<00:05:46.910> o'clock<00:05:47.300> I<00:05:47.450> think

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
the football control o'clock I think

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.720 
the football control o'clock I think
they<00:05:47.900> will<00:05:48.080> neutralize<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.190> pressure<00:05:49.460> from

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
they will neutralize the pressure from

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.310 
they will neutralize the pressure from
the<00:05:49.820> Detroit<00:05:50.180> Lions<00:05:50.360> by<00:05:50.570> taking<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:50.990> football

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
the Detroit Lions by taking the football

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.560 
the Detroit Lions by taking the football
out<00:05:51.530> of<00:05:51.590> Jay<00:05:52.280> Cutler's<00:05:52.640> hands<00:05:52.850> putting<00:05:53.180> it<00:05:53.419> in

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
out of Jay Cutler's hands putting it in

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.480 
out of Jay Cutler's hands putting it in
the<00:05:53.840> belly<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.320> Matt<00:05:54.530> Forte<00:05:54.890> I<00:05:54.919> think<00:05:55.250> that

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
the belly of Matt Forte I think that

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.340 
the belly of Matt Forte I think that
tight<00:05:55.700> a<00:05:55.729> win<00:05:56.000> this<00:05:56.120> ball<00:05:56.390> game<00:05:56.600> versus<00:05:57.320> a
