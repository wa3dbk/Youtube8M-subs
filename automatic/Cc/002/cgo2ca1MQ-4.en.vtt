00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.910
 are all guys that yellow are 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.500
 finally found with a new video 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 this will pass a very very video 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.559
 very, very intense like an old man 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.000
 as in old style because I really 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.070
 many things to say a short time a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.800
 arrangement is a ladder in front of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.689
 old times like them then I leave 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.519
 immediately taking a breath and I thank you 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.260
 for the ten thousand registered because they are 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.390
 really really many when I opened 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 the channel did not imagine I could 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 then reach such a threshold 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.410
 for me i think it's something 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.780
 really really cool 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 I thank everyone I really don't know 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.160
 what to say i didn't expect to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 get there so thank you all of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.690
 heart and introduced you immediately to the gameplay 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 that we face today because I believe 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.219
 at least it's a pretty cool thing 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.059
 I think I hope I do n't know it's a nuclear 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.309
 this you almost understood 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 and it's on grind and to make matters worse 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 resources a new map in Italy of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 nuclear su grindal less raises by name 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.590
 I do n't think I've seen it yet 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 as well with lethal rewards then for 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.770
 all those who told me yellow 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.059
 always with new and contracted or vi 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.150
 puts the swarm on the dogs 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.880
 here they are lucky you 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.000
 I admit I didn't go for a nuclears ho 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.260
 had only luck because slabs 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 that has lasted and therefore are 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.490
 managed to do something cool 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.960
 however I have to apologize for some things 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.250
 first of all it seems that in this video 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 shocked because care shocks because from 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 good asshole which is yellow are me 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 forgot to have resigned in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.939
 registration tied so I didn't have 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.470
 little program open and I have not registered e 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.020
 biso direct as always simply 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.820
 I hoped and I swear I was crying 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.729
 moments because I hoped how he had 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 registered i'm cabbage of the gameplay the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.659
 cinema because really having forgotten 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.740
 Delegated program is the delegate 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.659
 really got caught 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 very badly however fortunately apple 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.200
 registered 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.820
 if you see me as I take the nuclear 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.530
 curses network on him because he really is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.540
 tissima way I still dark 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.399
 I thank fabbri because as always I do 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.590
 helped to make the gameplay and I had 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.570
 a lot of luck and I'm complete the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.190
 connection that was fine factories me 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 screamed where not to go 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.210
 hollow for a dick so I got it 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.420
 luck really a lot anyway there 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.190
 I speak a little bit of the map I think 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.260
 grind is one of my favorites a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.600
 just maybe maybe it's better 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.710
 great I prefer downhill less I think 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.200
 that anyway great if the matter 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.990
 favorite so far the only thing 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.170
 now let's say from racing points to be 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.910
 ready joyous and the spawn factor why 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.680
 in all the maps of the map pack 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.750
 especially in this to the sponsors 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.140
 indeed absurd you see 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.550
 surely up here c towards the end gameplay 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.380
 what kind of thing will happen next year 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.850
 I'm around the people on the flag 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.710
 that I kill them all continues 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.120
 reborn weapons on him and it's something 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.330
 absurd in fact I think you need to have 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.190
 a protest a readiness of reflexes 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.570
 definitely good and fortunately also 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.320
 a good connection in this game 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.510
 so everything was really beautiful 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.040
 then kids practiced then 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.750
 for all those who do not yet have the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.130
 map I can adviser to take 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.630
 the map pack because I really think so 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.980
 the maps are really beautiful 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.510
 now i'm trying to do some 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.860
 gameplay on all other maps though 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.020
 until I get something 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.370
 really cool it wo n't load it anyway 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.600
 let's go ahead before the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.640
 time arrangement with only one 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 minute and thirty I catch my breath again 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.030
 then I wanted to talk about a channel of 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.700
 edith on the fan page 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.950
 I asked the fans to all of you if you had 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.530
 I wish you could please one of mine 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.830
 editing channel or a channel that 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.480
 I do not fuck it will not load us 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.830
 punctually second the commitments that is 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.190
 I'll charge when other then obviously 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.690
 so I don't know 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.060
 mostly I wanted to do this 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.310
 channel is only because I really 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.900
 many and on the computer and I would like a 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.760
 at the moment, dispose of it, some are 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.260
 beautiful maybe I wanted them to show and not 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.390
 I wanted to upload them to this channel 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.160
 here because here I would like to keep 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.019
 sincerely only call of duty or 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.200
 however games in general therefore not 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.360
 I know I would prefer it already when I load edit 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.769
 to hurry or various things to contest that 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.030
 they are construct to load the body that you 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.620
 it doesn't bother me like what I have 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.030
 uploaded a few days ago anyway 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.920
 let me know if you may be interested in a 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.170
 simple to go so that I on charges 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.820
 unpublished just see why many of 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.980
 you asked for something on the field not 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.750
 I say multimedia but photoshop 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.880
 after effect various bullshit 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.350
 obviously I won't do tutorial is maybe 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.130
 one can occasionally escape but 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.320
 mainly 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.720
 download my e in the last 30 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.280
 seconds remaining I have to say between 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.750
 quotes sponsor or otherwise will give 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.890
 one hand two channels the first best of 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.140
 show titta that reopened 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.790
 so I find in description let us a 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.560
 jump while the second channel is the 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.330
 heat yes between a sniper clan they have 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.640
 had some mess with the old channel 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.920
 therefore those who are interested have reopened 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.030
 I'm going to make a jump and peck seen 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.920
 nuclear at the last second not 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.300
 you beat me too much anyway guys I 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.100
 thank you again for everything and us 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.130
