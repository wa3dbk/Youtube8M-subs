00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.140
 friends race track of tarum達 with my friend 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 faithful of their high speed saints 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 medium high quality camera as they are 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.100
 all cancellations of the record 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.900
 we here already demanding of man 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.539
 I gave three recognition laps with 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.760
 the small visit one had directed 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.480
 something two turns when wedge and are 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.190
 Marcos 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.390
 he won two cars very different from 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.920
 behavior 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.930
 the obvious that I am now piloting the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.510
 the pomegranate is a very demanding 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.239
 higher than the street 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.999
 I would not do it at all 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 carlos sainz and used sparingly 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:39.239
 carlos has to be used within the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.089
 rules of the national transit code 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.639
 to its existing limits speed but 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.559
 here to wtorre to express the system 

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:49.139
 The car is really to see the job. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.829
 of the pensions is to see the 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:55.949
 steering wheel with steering wheel and also 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.769
 with the platform and platform of the year 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.190
 has a torsional rigidity 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.869
 exceptional 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 Of course it's difficult for my own camera. 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:06.270
 sitting on the back seat 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.490
 high speed pressure and I'm 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 an average of 189 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.740
 times in the initial lap because I 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 I did a track recognition before and the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.990
 has already given me a lot of confidence in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.910
 previous tests carried out in the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.190
 autodrome of interlagos in s達o paulo 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.810
 It's a car puts the wheels right in the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.120
 platform end 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 this generates an earring generates a 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.570
 greater lateral instability but not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.760
 put wheels in the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.670
 if the set of suspensions 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.010
 than a march in the front and a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.140
 torsion bar at the rear as with 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.690
 stabilizer bar was not a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.900
 very well calibrated suspension of the skin 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.920
 no he does not make excessive concessions of the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.930
 comfort 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.150
 maybe it will displease those hearts 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
 more conservative that confuses 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.340
 with the armchair in the living room but 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.530
 all the same theses and street and highway 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.720
 all I've walked with this car it 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.370
 all the time it gave me a 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.020
 great reliability 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.840
 he is very agile in urban traffic 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.640
 very good and fast freeway and here in the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.769
 total human and is not afraid does not give 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.910
 clues to what it is a car of 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.790
 extremely extremely 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.340
 neutral at the limit of and at the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.830
 grip he has the whole card and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.930
 front wheel drive a trend over 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.849
 interesting to get out of the way is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.980
 just take your foot off the accelerator he gets 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.530
 recolocam that's what this car I 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.989
 I'm testing there is no program 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.430
 stability his stability comes from 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.290
 people's collection 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.569
 note that I have precise domain that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.299
 the year he as I said is a boy who 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.849
 already a reliability is that we 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.440
 We're dealing with friends. 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.709
 car and insurance for the Brazilian family 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.630
 or do not imagine someone coming in 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.989
 single parent was crazy 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.170
 huh 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.180
 to enter the highway in addition to these 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.400
 here I'm doing curve exactly to 61 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.329
 times for which I do not use nor 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.950
 all steps 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.290
 We are now in the state we ret達o 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.810
 go up a little here and see where it is 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.069
 it arrives at curve 1 is always a curve 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.870
 challenging 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.480
 I'm going to spend a fourth that engine three 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.160
 35hp engine cylinders eminently 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.720
 it has its limitations 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.760
 only it is not a competition car and 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.829
 It's not the sports car, but it's a guy. 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.139
 extremely bad for me to enter 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.959
 to 1 I switched to the fourth gear in the 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.730
 There's no way out of twists and he's not 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.190
 lost the trajectory of the curve that I 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.889
 I say I take a lot of faith in Gaza and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.220
 curve with that tranquility in high 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.930
 The speed we hear here is a tv 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.150
 It gave me a lot of confidence that in 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.739
 for a very simple reason 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.200
 the power assisted steering is 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.060
 very firm is very accurate 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.609
 it generates what we need 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.609
 more when you drive carlos in 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.230
 speed that is called rodrigo that 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.340
 to feel where we are going to do 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.560
 exactly the tangency of the curve is this 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.069
 that leaves me here completely 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.680
 quiet to enter the curve here 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.870
 the challenging curves without tarum達 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.049
 no loss of directional stability 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.180
 because I did not talk about the door 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.519
 suitcases did not mention finishing details 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.979
 car is very well finished and he has this 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.169
 intrinsic quality of volkswagen 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.359
 and there is one thing that pleases me a lot and 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.150
 won four five stars psd where 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.820
 either of directional impact deficit 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.180
 side 10 of frontal impact 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.310
 and rear and has won here the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.560
 same four and five stars in the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.080
 tests performed by the athlete in cape 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.910
 which in fact should test much more expensive 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.580
 here in Brazil and try mainly 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.650
 these Chinese cars to see if they 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.910
 are really safe if they deserve the 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.070
 consumer confidence 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.050
 I know the - a Chinese who has passed 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.310
 by nike is we must be just that 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.530
 those are angelic 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.710
 e7 won four and five stars the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.210
 rest has not been tested so 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.160
 know also if the car you are 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.759
 Putting your family in is a car. 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.729
 starring if you have 10 stars and 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.349
 tests carried out outside Brazil 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.539
 sincerely leave it quiet there in the 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.880
 cry do not buy because you are 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.830
 putting your life at risk and the life of the 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.470
 your family at risk what is the note that the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.909
 double exercising one bread broke the 9 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.530
 no less than that 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.530
 Let's now test the Martin
