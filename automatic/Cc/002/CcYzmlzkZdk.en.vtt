00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:04.379
 In human medicine now magnetic resonance imaging has long been considered 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.480
 For sure, the technique has been safe for about three years 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.869
 also used on the horse as that works exactly shows our visit to the 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.399
 Equine Clinic Burg MÃ¼ggenhausen is the pioneer in this field 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.750
 Everyday work in Attaching lying house 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.949
 Veterinarian daughter Thomas Weinberger takes care of the lame 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.480
 Werner Luz the stallion is sent by his owners extra from Spain 

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:38.239
 Pictures may not be treated as its name 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.179
 My Berger and his colleague Thorsten decide on a diagnosis 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.179
 Schulte to a magnetic resonance tomography 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.590
 Before it goes into the treatment room, patient Sulza has to use one 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.030
 Sedative be made tired 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.740
 with it the magnetic resonance imaging 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 30 escapes 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.500
 and then 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.950
 The patient is carefully guided into the treatment room 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.440
 the horse will be placed suitable for the treatment 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.710
 Vet grapes Schultze explains the exact treatment 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.620
 Furthermore, the foreign currency trips must be horseshoe-shaped Indian 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.830
 UTV Ignition we will of course 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.100
 then we will take the money my wings 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.190
 the examining Bizet are positioned magnets 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.630
 now is the computer 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.660
 I take the pictures while I do 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.460
 siemens-title the cuts 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.430
 To be more right should lead a team like his leg 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.630
 have looked 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.940
 the sculptor magnetic resonance tomograph 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.409
 works with the help of a magnet 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.500
 d ten thousand times stronger than the parents Zion's power 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.810
 a coil because of the frequencies in the fourth UNMISS then weeps the signals 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.099
 Come back 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.999
 These are displayed via a cable as images on the computer at this 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:21.129
 The stallion has to keep the procedure up to 200 pictures become profiles 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.679
 the two made 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.699
 the treatment time can vary 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.299
 that would have to depend on the cooperation of the patient we are here 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.049
 in a work we do so naturally and 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.839
 that's because of being very individual 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:36.999
 I would say so 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.799
 that we at least for a yard the team of the credit with up to 2 20 minutes 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:42.809
 need 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.809
 but that can also pull faster up to a three-quarter length 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.639
 no registration very finally leave the treatment room 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:53.410
 together 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.580
 The two physicians spin off the MRI images on the computer 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.389
 seen by the web host Strato for "what makes sense want" One has in question 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.320
 until then it has to be like that 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.069
 financially but when she let 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.290
 the oldest one is 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.829
 it's great 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.059
 the Israeli army and not at all 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.849
 and it is essential for us 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.260
 Celsius guarantee these clowns Fakire the verdict 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.689
 and one is pulling him out of the hospital 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.739
 You did not have to name those taken seriously 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.809
 Wiesent Carsten Heitfeld can turn off a lot of water 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.159
 and because different sculptures with the first attack 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.049
 it looks the covenant out again 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.540
 and if we want to get that chance then we are reporting that 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.259
 some of these 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.540
 at Holmenkollen 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.939
 Euro were previously provided 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.579
 that the upper hand 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.819
 one point of discussion was that is the problem and what is the problem but they 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.409
 are not all 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.319
 may be required and not recognize 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.619
 in Hessen are not all bad inside the assistant 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:12.299
 No family structure No we have a structure we have seven children 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.109
 was looking into the port of Cannes with excitement they want to see 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.360
 and that is very important to us Rheine we can do so the company 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.059
 really only recognize this 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:30.080
 that is very little in proportion to seeing what we need are going on 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.419
 the diagnosis is then confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.520
 Sultan's slave dermatitis can now be treated until now 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.140
 After eating the whole exam we had clear diagnosis 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.759
 according to start therapy 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.080
 Of course, this therapy does not mean that everything goes from one day to the next 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.400
 ok again but i think that we 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.690
 good luck in six weeks the field re-admissions and for that the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.300
 is already over nine months Lahm it is now the very good period 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.300
 what do we like to do to their inflammatory areas of the bone 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.220
 Zion Bone ignites in bad reputation position 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.850
 overloading and that means we do not just have to resort to medication 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.400
 but also have to and played special fitting the setting 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.009
 correct and then additionally give an infusion that are always one 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.229
 special drug which is new on the market what it helps 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.840
 To reduce bone inflammation very quickly and afterwards was with the 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.840
 Taking pain away is important to us, not just the pain 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.879
 Take away what's going on here on the bone 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.340
 after a successful treatment 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.970
 Pulpit than Life left the clinic and returned to his native Spain 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.570
 to travel
