pieces and raucous stealth machine
pieces<00:00:41.200> in<00:00:41.920> case<00:00:42.280> you're<00:00:42.489> wondering<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.930> is

pieces in case you're wondering this is

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.130 
pieces in case you're wondering this is
gonna<00:00:44.230> be<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.499> fairly<00:00:44.859> complex<00:00:45.550> build<00:00:45.969> so<00:00:46.390> you

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
gonna be a fairly complex build so you

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.970 
gonna be a fairly complex build so you
might<00:00:47.289> want<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.620> pay<00:00:47.859> attention<00:00:47.890> or<00:00:48.760> something

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
might want to pay attention or something

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.239 
might want to pay attention or something
okay

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
okay

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.029 
okay
so<00:00:51.519> we<00:00:51.699> got<00:00:51.940> these<00:00:52.690> little<00:00:53.050> waste<00:00:53.260> pieces<00:00:53.769> on

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
so we got these little waste pieces on

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
so we got these little waste pieces on
here<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:54.850> next<00:00:55.570> up<00:00:55.960> working<00:00:56.350> on<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.649> arms

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
here and next up working on the arms

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.889 
here and next up working on the arms
they'll<00:00:58.690> put<00:00:58.929> some<00:00:59.170> armor<00:00:59.739> on<00:01:00.190> there<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.780> then

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
they'll put some armor on there and then

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.160 
they'll put some armor on there and then
we've<00:01:02.109> got<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.729> gun<00:01:03.729> parts<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:05.379> here<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.960> make

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
we've got the gun parts on here and make

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.260 
we've got the gun parts on here and make
sure<00:01:08.380> these<00:01:08.770> little<00:01:09.100> pieces<00:01:09.280> are<00:01:09.580> alternating

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
sure these little pieces are alternating

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.590 
sure these little pieces are alternating
so<00:01:10.479> they<00:01:10.659> can

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
so they can

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.750 
so they can
interlocking<00:01:12.590> into<00:01:12.800> each<00:01:12.890> other<00:01:13.100> yeah<00:01:13.490> that's

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
interlocking into each other yeah that's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.680 
interlocking into each other yeah that's
what<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:15.070> we<00:01:16.070> got<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.340> gun<00:01:16.580> face<00:01:16.880> here<00:01:17.300> put

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
what it is we got the gun face here put

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.940 
what it is we got the gun face here put
some<00:01:17.720> little<00:01:17.990> eyes<00:01:18.290> in<00:01:18.650> there<00:01:19.150> okay<00:01:20.620> so<00:01:21.620> good

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
some little eyes in there okay so good

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.480 
some little eyes in there okay so good
set<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.850> off<00:01:22.970> further<00:01:23.210> side<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:24.310> right<00:01:25.310> now

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
set that off further side and right now

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.190 
set that off further side and right now
working<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.060> waist<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:26.780> this<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.080> the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
working on the waist now this is the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.120 
working on the waist now this is the
most<00:01:27.380> complex<00:01:27.830> part<00:01:28.010> of<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.550> build<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.780> you

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
most complex part of the build so you

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
most complex part of the build so you
probably<00:01:31.130> want<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:31.970> pay<00:01:32.240> attention

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.050 

okay<00:01:37.409> stick<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:41.280> where<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> legs

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
okay stick that there is where the legs

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.040 
okay stick that there is where the legs
will<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.690> later

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.730 

stick<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> back

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
stick that on there and then the back

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
stick that on there and then the back
this<00:01:53.100> part<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.790> keep<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.300> waste<00:01:54.510> from

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this part will keep the waste from

assembly that holds the canisters this

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.399 
assembly that holds the canisters this
is<00:03:25.760> kind<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.150> weird<00:03:26.360> design<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:27.200> might

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
is kind of a weird design you might

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.970 
is kind of a weird design you might
wanna<00:03:27.970> also<00:03:28.970> pay<00:03:29.209> attention

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
