00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 in fact estimated viewers of all 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.029
 sports news we start with what 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.560
 is our previous coverage of what is going 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.510
 to be the return match for the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.599
 semifinals of the concacaf league 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.070
 campeones- gabriel gómez as footballer 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.800
 of the sport club herediano midfielder 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.170
 gabriel then what to expect from this 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 semifinal and you wanted it what 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 they got left on the road to olympics 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 which it was then perhaps the moment 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 difficult in this series before the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 Hondurans I believe that since 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.080
 we started the championship always always 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.600
 it was logically difficult with the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.360
 mentality of transcending we knew that in 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.360
 Honduras was not going to be easy the game and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 much less in heredia as it had 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
 given everything in Honduras 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 We knew how to face a difficult opponent 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.879
 but thank God we could take the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.570
 the desire to be able to classify 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.039
 semifinals and now we find another 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.149
 Mexican rival we had already had a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 group phase that was the champion 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.590
 the national double champion of mexico as it was 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.410
 Leon now we have the last champion of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.910
 Mexico that is America and let's hope 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.110
 we behave at the height of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 commitment and after continuing to transcend 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.939
 in this championship alone the series 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 it seems like it is very motivating truth 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.869
 does not require anything else now there is a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.009
 situation also involving the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.440
 Costa Rican soccer they come from 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.640
 leave thrashed 5 0 to saprissa the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.320
 club sport herediano has that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880
 possibility of giving the bell if 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.580
 we can call in some way and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 let's hope that if you know one that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.009
 no party looks like another too 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.780
 we are aware of the analysis 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.840
 deep that we did in both parties 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.119
 against saprissa I think here saprissa not 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.549
 It was blunt and that was what marked 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.190
 the difference for america me in 10 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.770
 minutes were convincing about 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.590
 very effective players and at the end of what 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.539
 who decides the series for them but 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 we see that they do not see 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.220
 also be very 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.800
 concentrate because they are 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.750
 it is a team of much much danger 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.030
 has very experienced players with 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.370
 transcendental players but not only 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.780
 we have to know how to use our 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.720
 weapons our ability to pull 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.030
 advantage in case it is true that the attitude 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.440
 because it plays its true role in the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.180
 understood that we are talking about the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.830
 return party in the federal district 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.870
 but soccer players like you have already 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.610
 played there with his team and so 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.800
 So much to see is a team with thirst for 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
 race triumph courageously with 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.900
 honor all these situations play 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 yes yes of course we will take the measure 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.910
 necessary to make the trip 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.830
 logically in the height there is no for not 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.900
 feel it in my experience since it would be 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.110
 my god wants and can be for that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.110
 I play my fifth game in the df 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.570
 an Aztec stadium where where the majority 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.600
 of sometimes has gone a day earlier to not 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.370
 feel the choking also in huelva in the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.650
 peace that is much more difficult in Bogota 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 also that it is difficult to be 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.580
 well physically mentally and know of 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.520
 that the drown are the first 15 minutes 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.650
 and then you feel good and the 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.070
 opportunity is to define the party in 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.320
 home bring a positive margin to for 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.709
 turn around and be aware that it is a 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.420
 team that also beyond the strong 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.490
 which is in attack is also vulnerable to 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.290
 the time to defend plays the stadium 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.820
 Aztec that is talking about what 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.470
 means is an emblem a 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.970
 world-renowned infrastructure 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.310
 and a historical field worldwide 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.200
 there are global endings 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.150
 and face America logically in 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.920
 this instance of semifinals will be 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.020
 full to burst but I think for 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.230
 any player being in a stadium 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.030
 full is an immense motivation and more in 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.700
 instances that are facing 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.959
 the america knowing that we 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.599
 we also do not have our ability 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.060
 our weapons the team has made a 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.489
 good championship and hopefully try to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.019
 ratify the nice moment that we should 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.080
 demonstrate in this cup 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.180
 both in heredia and in the Aztec are 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.590
 all to a Costa Rican final can 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.880
 to be is within the possibility of 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.769
 calendar has shown this way the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.769
 semifinals are given so that 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.380
 so be it and because it's not nice to visualize 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.780
 that situation I think costa rica so 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.510
 that he has done in the last World Cup and in 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.340
 this last year and marketing 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.560
 concachampions what he has shown in his 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.900
 teams having three in phases 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.250
 final two now in semifinals I think 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.200
 it would 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.090
 it's an important recognition for 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.000
 this country that the truth raised a lot 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.680
 It has grown and the teams 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 shown in this championship are left 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.770
 side shirts 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.120
 x Celtic came to everyone because we 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.190
 we put on a team shirt 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.860
 Costa Rican pushing and supporting the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.440
 concacaf yes logically when now in 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.420
 this distance to heredia plays the league 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.660
 I think we are representing at the expense 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.210
 rich here does not play anyone's country in 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.470
 my case yes Panamanian that represents 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.650
 a costa rica 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.510
 we must be 100% concentrated and as 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.360
 you mention it the guarani gave it 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.419
 just like something soccer plays the country 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.340
 and hopefully everyone is supporting 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.230
 this team and god want and be cute 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.840
 see it in the final we turn the page 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.200
 you mentioned something so interesting 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.090
 true 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.340
 Hernán Darío Gómez is summoned 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.710
 comes a very important match one of 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.660
 those true Central American classics 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.210
 costa rica panama panama costa rica 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.490
 the rommel fernandez the maximum 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.260
 sports scene of your cute country 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.440
 ecstasy jubilation and long live the 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.510
 football not like that 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.240
 that 's a match that nobody wants 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.760
 lose and less in my case to represent 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.580
 to my country as in the country where where 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.310
 I currently live residue game 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.470
 I try to professionally help 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.680
 equipment well costa rica but logically 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.120
 it's about the selection be thanks to 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.129
 god of a call to power 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.349
 be in that match and without a doubt the 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.509
 espinita left me for the last 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.509
 a coffee where the last minute to 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:53.129
 invest you kill me to the criminal then like 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.259
 I have always done no match 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.599
 but it always gives you the opportunity to 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.759
 football to be able to claim those 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.590
 negative moments that you had in the 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.020
 past and now I want and be this 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.139
 nice opportunity to be able to continue 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.000
 we improving the game the Panamanian 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.590
 and know that we prepare for the 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.719
 important thing that comes that is cup 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.310
 gold and tie you together with the 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:16.020
 defender of the sporting saprissa dolfo 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.509
 machado are we could call the 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.150
 spies of truth of hernán darío gómez and 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.710
 all of that counts of course of ariel and 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.719
 logical but I think that already in football 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.569
 there is not much mystery and everyone 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:30.180
 we all know each other faced first 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.969
 of caused to the coast selection 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.380
 rich we know players we know how 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.780
 they play 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.690
 we must not ignore that logical in its 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.250
 At the moment we will talk about some things that 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.680
 we do not know what they will ask us and without 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.610
 we will certainly try to see if it is an advantage 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.980
 because no no no no no talk the and let's hope 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.110
 is that from getting there first there is a 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.400
 party in Trinidad and get well for 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.890
 the game against costa rica and that the 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.530
 people can enjoy the point of 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.840
 view of gabriel el gavilán gómez as 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.190
 they call him popularly in football 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.080
 this footballer of Panamanian origin 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.610
 we continue with more friends than it is 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.010
 our previous coverage of what is going to 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.150
 be this important party and that therefore 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.400
 again the soccer of costa rica 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.530
 transcends in the semifinals of the 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.280
 concacaf club america before the sport club 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:20.180
 herediano I have sinned that I have sinned but 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.180
 that I have sinned that I have sinned
