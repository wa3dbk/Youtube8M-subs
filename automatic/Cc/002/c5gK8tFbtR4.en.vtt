but why we're shooting crackerjack what
we<00:04:52.950> can<00:04:53.130> do<00:04:53.370> is<00:04:53.550> use<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.760> bonus<00:04:54.210> thing<00:04:54.420> and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
we can do is use the bonus thing and

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.050 
we can do is use the bonus thing and
literally<00:04:55.560> shooting<00:04:55.830> through<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.280> ceiling

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
literally shooting through the ceiling

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.120

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
if we can hit it probably we have an

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.550 
if we can hit it probably we have an
actual<00:04:59.250> got<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.580> go<00:04:59.670> out<00:04:59.790> to<00:04:59.910> him<00:05:00.380> this<00:05:01.380> is<00:05:01.470> why
