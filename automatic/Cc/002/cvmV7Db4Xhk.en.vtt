being<00:01:27.119> rideable<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.080> he<00:01:28.259> does<00:01:28.470> provide

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
being rideable is that he does provide

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.850 
being rideable is that he does provide
shade<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.460> actually<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.509> help<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.650> not

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
melt / not freeze to death so that's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.890 
melt / not freeze to death so that's
pretty<00:01:35.189> cool<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.780> him

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
