00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
you can expect the difficulty level to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.009 
you can expect the difficulty level to
raise<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.340> each<00:00:11.550> lesson<00:00:11.790> alright<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.840> for

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and three E and four E and got one the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
and three E and four E and got one the
next<00:00:56.850> step<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> accent<00:00:57.660> every<00:00:57.930> note<00:00:58.109> that

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
next step is to accent every note that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
next step is to accent every note that
follows<00:00:58.559> another<00:00:58.770> accent<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.030> accenting

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
follows another accent so for accenting

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.330 
follows another accent so for accenting
the<00:01:00.600> downbeat<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.500> e<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.160> will

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the downbeat of one the e of one will

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.460 
the downbeat of one the e of one will
also<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.699> accented<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.840> take<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> first

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
also be accented so if we take the first

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
also be accented so if we take the first
pattern<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.100> example<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.060> like

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
pattern as an example it will be like

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.429 
pattern as an example it will be like
this<00:01:06.770> one<00:01:07.770> E<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.040> two<00:01:08.909> E<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.299> A<00:01:09.930> three<00:01:09.960> E<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
four E and one alright so once you got

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
four E and one alright so once you got
all<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.090> next<00:01:33.360> step<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.750> play<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
all that down the next step is to play a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.140 
all that down the next step is to play a
paradiddle<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> fourth<00:01:35.220> beat<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:36.030> way

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
paradiddle on the fourth beat that way

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.060 
paradiddle on the fourth beat that way
you<00:01:36.210> switch<00:01:36.540> everything<00:01:36.840> Iran<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> play

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you switch everything Iran and you play

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490 
you switch everything Iran and you play
everything<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.640> left-hand<00:01:39.150> lead<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.380> we

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
everything as left-hand lead to so if we

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
everything as left-hand lead to so if we
take<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> first<00:01:41.040> pattern<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:41.549> an<00:01:41.670> example<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
take the first pattern as an example it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.649 
take the first pattern as an example it
will<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.130> one<00:01:44.130> E<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.430> two<00:01:45.180> E<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
will be like this one E and two E and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.330 
will be like this one E and two E and
three<00:01:46.200> E<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.750> paradiddle<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.110> E<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.380> two<00:01:50.220> E

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
three E and paradiddle one E and two E

end up right the dull one alright that's
it<00:02:37.380> for<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.709> introduction<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> patterns

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it for the introduction to the patterns

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.000 
it for the introduction to the patterns
and<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> first<00:02:39.390> exercises<00:02:40.140> make<00:02:40.769> sure<00:02:40.920> you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
and the first exercises make sure you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.220 
and the first exercises make sure you
can<00:02:41.160> play<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.459> patterns<00:02:41.819> repeatedly<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.569> try

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
can play the patterns repeatedly and try

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.900 
can play the patterns repeatedly and try
to<00:02:43.290> focus<00:02:43.709> on<00:02:43.830> popping<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> accents<00:02:44.819> and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
to focus on popping the accents and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.880 
to focus on popping the accents and
keeping<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.360> ghost<00:02:45.569> notes<00:02:45.750> low<00:02:46.019> rather<00:02:46.650> than

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
keeping the ghost notes low rather than

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.979 
keeping the ghost notes low rather than
speeding<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.760> playing<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.180> fast<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
speeding up and playing it fast so the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.210 
speeding up and playing it fast so the
reason<00:02:49.260> why<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.410> might<00:02:49.590> want<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> learn<00:02:50.010> this

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
reason why you might want to learn this

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.890 
reason why you might want to learn this
pattern<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.670> because<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.299> only<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> very

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
pattern is because it's not only a very

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.960 
pattern is because it's not only a very
common<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.620> called<00:02:52.890> dotted<00:02:53.310> quarter<00:02:53.670> dotted

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
common so called dotted quarter dotted

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.089 
common so called dotted quarter dotted
quarter<00:02:54.299> quarter<00:02:54.480> pattern<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.650> also<00:02:55.829> going

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
quarter quarter pattern it's also going

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.740 
quarter quarter pattern it's also going
to<00:02:56.190> help<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.670> future<00:02:56.849> when<00:02:57.239> we<00:02:57.360> add<00:02:57.480> things

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
to help in the future when we add things

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.690 
to help in the future when we add things
such<00:02:57.840> as<00:02:57.959> double<00:02:58.440> pedals<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.160> flam's<00:02:59.459> to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
such as double pedals and flam's to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.339 
such as double pedals and flam's to
everything<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.660> good<00:03:00.870> solid<00:03:01.140> base

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
everything to have a good solid base

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.930 
everything to have a good solid base
it's<00:03:01.860> going<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.130> make<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.340> very<00:03:02.610> much<00:03:02.880> easier

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
it's going to make it very much easier

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.360 
it's going to make it very much easier
