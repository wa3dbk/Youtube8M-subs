00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
ram mount and what what it does you can

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.360 
ram mount and what what it does you can
tighten<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:39.829> once<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> where

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
tighten it down once you get it where

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.420 
tighten it down once you get it where
you<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.780> unlock<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.590> pull<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> key

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you want it you unlock it pull the key

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
you want it you unlock it pull the key
out<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> spins<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.660> therefore<00:00:46.079> they<00:00:46.200> can

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
out and it spins so therefore they can

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.139 
out and it spins so therefore they can
get<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.710> its<00:00:46.829> tamper<00:00:47.219> resistant<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.969> get

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
get in its tamper resistant can I get

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.720 
get in its tamper resistant can I get
into<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> other<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.430> where
