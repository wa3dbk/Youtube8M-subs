response trigger kid Egret kid uh I did
it<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.009> guess<00:01:47.189> these<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.369> some<00:01:47.729> upgrades

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it and I guess these are some upgrades

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.899 
it and I guess these are some upgrades
you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:51.590> my<00:01:52.590> uh<00:01:53.960> let's<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.049> in

okay<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.049> Tiffany<00:01:58.590> five<00:01:59.040> manual<00:01:59.460> looks<00:01:59.939> fairly

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
okay so Tiffany five manual looks fairly

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.640 
okay so Tiffany five manual looks fairly
big

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.160 

he'll<00:02:05.510> bun<00:02:06.510> itself<00:02:08.450> Daniel<00:02:09.450> okay<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.990> heavy

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
he'll bun itself Daniel okay it's heavy

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.660 
he'll bun itself Daniel okay it's heavy
and<00:02:10.500> thought<00:02:10.800> it'd<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.160> heavy<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and thought it'd be that heavy with the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.330 
and thought it'd be that heavy with the
Selectric<00:02:12.060> grip<00:02:12.210> on<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.770> what<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.800> would<00:02:13.920> think

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:26.230 

safety<00:02:23.780> all<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.200> theater<00:02:25.560> mode

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
safety all right so theater mode

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.480 
safety all right so theater mode
basically<00:02:27.240> fire<00:02:27.690> moves<00:02:27.950> nice<00:02:28.950> looking<00:02:29.310> gun
