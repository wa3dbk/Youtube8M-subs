Nintendo<00:01:09.870> GameCube<00:01:10.710> games<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.180> Gamecube

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
Nintendo GameCube games now the Gamecube

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.220 
Nintendo GameCube games now the Gamecube
was<00:01:13.310> nintendos<00:01:14.310> next<00:01:14.430> console<00:01:15.420> after<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
was nintendos next console after the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.150 
was nintendos next console after the
insular<00:01:17.160> 64<00:01:17.910> and<00:01:18.180> before<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.050> Nintendo<00:01:19.590> Wii<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
insular 64 and before the Nintendo Wii I

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.910 
insular 64 and before the Nintendo Wii I
think<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.760> game<00:01:20.940> team<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.780> good<00:01:22.140> games

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
think the game team was very good games

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.880 
think the game team was very good games
for<00:01:23.100> sure<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.660> think<00:01:24.930> Nintendo<00:01:25.260> could<00:01:25.740> have

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
for sure but I think Nintendo could have

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
for sure but I think Nintendo could have
supported<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.900> now<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
supported it a bit more I think now a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590 
supported it a bit more I think now a
bit<00:01:28.320> distracted<00:01:29.010> by<00:01:29.220> working<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> waite

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
bit distracted by working on the waite

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
bit distracted by working on the waite
trying<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.260> that<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.620> time<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.520> there

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
trying to get that out in time but there

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.570 
trying to get that out in time but there
were<00:01:32.730> some<00:01:32.910> really<00:01:33.210> good<00:01:33.540> games<00:01:33.840> made<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
were some really good games made for the

were some really good games made for the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.560

like<00:02:28.140> yesterday<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.550> single<00:02:30.060> game<00:02:30.300> to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
like yesterday just a single game to

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.360 
like yesterday just a single game to
juice<00:02:30.780> up<00:02:30.959> all<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:31.320> slots<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:31.980> memory

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
juice up all your slots on the memory

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.270 
juice up all your slots on the memory
card<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.209> was<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> bit<00:02:33.720> annoying<00:02:34.050> oh<00:02:34.380> also

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
card so that was a bit annoying oh also

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.229 
card so that was a bit annoying oh also
I<00:02:35.459> think<00:02:35.820> first<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.840> Nintendo<00:02:37.500> console<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
I think first for Nintendo console the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.259 
I think first for Nintendo console the
Gamecube<00:02:39.750> actually<00:02:40.440> had<00:02:40.950> an<00:02:41.310> interface<00:02:42.030> when

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
Gamecube actually had an interface when

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.560 
Gamecube actually had an interface when
you<00:02:42.360> turned<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.870> without<00:02:43.200> any<00:02:43.700> disk<00:02:44.700> inside<00:02:45.239> so

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
you turned on without any disk inside so

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.030 
you turned on without any disk inside so
money<00:02:45.900> sure<00:02:46.260> save<00:02:47.040> files<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.040> because

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
money sure save files and so on because

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.880 
money sure save files and so on because
the<00:02:50.280> game<00:02:51.030> previews<00:02:51.600> minidiscs<00:02:52.590> eight

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.850 
I think to try and stop piracy no people
coping<00:03:22.430> with<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.330> people<00:03:24.200> found<00:03:24.680> that

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
coping with this but people found that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.930 
coping with this but people found that
it's<00:03:25.130> all<00:03:25.989> way<00:03:26.989> through<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.709> certain<00:03:28.160> games<00:03:28.400> to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
it's all way through in certain games to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.180 
it's all way through in certain games to
get<00:03:29.300> their<00:03:29.480> own<00:03:29.630> Cove<00:03:29.989> running<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:30.590> stuff<00:03:30.890> so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
get their own Cove running this stuff so

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.009 
get their own Cove running this stuff so
wasn't<00:03:31.819> really<00:03:32.150> worth<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.480> effort<00:03:32.840> and

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
wasn't really worth the effort and

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.020 
wasn't really worth the effort and
because<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.950> game<00:03:34.130> can<00:03:34.160> police<00:03:34.580> with<00:03:34.790> such

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
because the game can police with such

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.160 
because the game can police with such
low<00:03:35.450> capacity<00:03:37.330> some<00:03:38.330> games<00:03:38.569> that<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.870> come<00:03:39.050> on

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
low capacity some games that to come on

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.370 
low capacity some games that to come on

the games it was one of the problems of
the<00:04:06.709> game<00:04:06.920> had<00:04:07.489> very<00:04:07.819> few<00:04:08.239> online<00:04:08.750> games<00:04:09.049> words

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
the game had very few online games words

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.830 
the game had very few online games words
of<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.650> play<00:04:09.890> second<00:04:10.310> switch<00:04:10.580> Xbox<00:04:11.510> people

of the play second switch Xbox people

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.410 
of the play second switch Xbox people
were<00:04:11.900> taking<00:04:12.319> it<00:04:12.410> online<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.060> think<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.269> lot

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
were taking it online so I think a lot

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.840 
were taking it online so I think a lot
of<00:04:14.450> developers<00:04:15.100> didn't<00:04:16.100> like<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.340> GameCube

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
of developers didn't like the GameCube

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.000 
of developers didn't like the GameCube
because<00:04:17.239> I'm<00:04:17.359> not<00:04:17.479> having<00:04:17.720> any<00:04:17.810> online

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
because I'm not having any online

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.039 
because I'm not having any online
support<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.280> such<00:04:20.060> there<00:04:20.390> so<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:20.570> lot<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.840> games

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
support and such there so a lot of games

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.490

thing<00:04:47.900> about<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.289> GameCube<00:04:48.740> controller<00:04:49.190> or

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
thing about the GameCube controller or

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.700 
thing about the GameCube controller or
not<00:04:49.910> I<00:04:50.060> had<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.419> unlock<00:04:50.780> sticks<00:04:51.169> but<00:04:51.350> one<00:04:51.560> was

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
not I had to unlock sticks but one was

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.520 
not I had to unlock sticks but one was
designed<00:04:51.919> especially<00:04:52.760> for<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.930> camera<00:04:54.350> but

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
designed especially for the camera but

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.469 
designed especially for the camera but
of<00:04:54.650> course<00:04:54.889> games<00:04:55.190> didn't<00:04:55.669> have<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:55.970> use<00:04:56.210> that

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
of course games didn't have to use that

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.810 
of course games didn't have to use that
that<00:04:56.600> was<00:04:56.810> what<00:04:56.930> Nintendo<00:04:57.470> intended<00:04:58.039> this<00:04:58.550> one

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
that was what Nintendo intended this one

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.450 
that was what Nintendo intended this one
here<00:04:59.210> it's<00:05:00.200> sort<00:05:00.289> of<00:05:00.380> an<00:05:00.500> extension<00:05:01.160> of<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
here it's sort of an extension of the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.370 
here it's sort of an extension of the
instance<00:05:01.820> default<00:05:02.330> camera<00:05:02.570> but<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:03.169> guess

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
instance default camera but I guess

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.500 
instance default camera but I guess
Nintendo<00:05:03.950> going<00:05:04.220> along<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.610> same<00:05:04.880> nice

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
Nintendo going along the same nice

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.810 
Nintendo going along the same nice
anyway<00:05:06.200> this<00:05:06.410> controller<00:05:06.919> doubles<00:05:07.400> offices

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
anyway this controller doubles offices

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.190 
anyway this controller doubles offices
