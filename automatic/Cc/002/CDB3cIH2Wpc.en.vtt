00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
catching them with a hook and line
through<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> ice<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> wintertime<00:01:52.950> when

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
through the ice in the wintertime when

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.240 
through the ice in the wintertime when
it's<00:01:53.460> above<00:01:53.880> freezing<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.590> easy<00:01:55.950> to

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it's above freezing it's it's easy to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.700 
it's above freezing it's it's easy to
fish<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.060> line<00:01:57.270> goes<00:01:57.509> through<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.500> don't

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
fish the line goes through and we don't

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.440 
fish the line goes through and we don't
really<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.280> issue<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.939> freezing

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
really have an issue with it freezing

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.350 
really have an issue with it freezing
but<00:02:01.110> when<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.799> below<00:02:01.979> zero<00:02:02.360> you're

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
but when when it's below zero you're

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.690 
but when when it's below zero you're
saying<00:02:03.630> well<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.140> know<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:05.130> line<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
gonna freeze up it's gonna freeze in the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.830 
gonna freeze up it's gonna freeze in the
hole<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.489> that's<00:02:08.700> where<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> ice<00:02:09.239> stopper

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
hole but that's where the ice stopper

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.980

bobber up with the non-toxic line the
icer<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.130> bobber<00:02:21.370> will<00:02:21.580> freeze<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.630> hole

icer the bobber will freeze in the hole

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.110 
icer the bobber will freeze in the hole
but<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.500> keeps<00:02:23.650> your<00:02:23.890> line<00:02:24.040> going<00:02:24.700> up<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.000> down
