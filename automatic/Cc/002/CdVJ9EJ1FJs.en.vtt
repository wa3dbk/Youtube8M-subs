00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
this system this is a really great place

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.540 
this system this is a really great place
to<00:03:31.450> come<00:03:31.480> because<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.190> really<00:03:33.400> big

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
to come because it's a it's a really big

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.430 
to come because it's a it's a really big
contrast<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.150> where<00:03:34.330> we<00:03:34.480> start<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> trip
