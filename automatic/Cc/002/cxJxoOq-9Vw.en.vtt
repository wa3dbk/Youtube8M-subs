reasons we're adding accelerator to this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.709 
reasons we're adding accelerator to this
is<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.170> use<00:02:04.200> ez-flo<00:02:04.950> 60<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.299> normally

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
is if we use ez-flo 60 as it is normally

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.499

remove<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.070> casting<00:03:59.670> that's<00:04:00.180> cured<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
remove a casting that's cured in the

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.620 
remove a casting that's cured in the
thick<00:04:01.260> areas<00:04:01.709> but<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.430> still<00:04:02.610> tacky<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.390> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
thick areas but it's still tacky in the

areas<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.930> casting<00:04:07.579> it's<00:04:08.579> actually<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
areas of a casting it's actually the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.270 
areas of a casting it's actually the
inverse<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.930> an<00:04:10.049> air<00:04:10.230> drying<00:04:10.560> material<00:04:11.100> and

inverse of an air drying material and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.039 
inverse of an air drying material and
there<00:04:11.430> you'll<00:04:11.579> see<00:04:11.850> it's<00:04:12.120> actually<00:04:12.299> changing

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
there you'll see it's actually changing

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.530 
there you'll see it's actually changing
white<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.850> everywhere<00:04:14.850> it's<00:04:14.970> turned<00:04:15.239> white

white and everywhere it's turned white

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.880 
white and everywhere it's turned white
is<00:04:15.750> where<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.019> actually<00:04:16.140> solid<00:04:16.620> you'll

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
is where it's actually solid you'll

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.440 
is where it's actually solid you'll
notice<00:04:17.160> right<00:04:17.370> around<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.820> perimeter<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.359> the
