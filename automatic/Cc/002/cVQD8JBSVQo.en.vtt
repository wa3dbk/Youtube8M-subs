in this video I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.799 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:00:07.220> to<00:00:07.250> use<00:00:07.340> an<00:00:07.549> application<00:00:08.000> entitled

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
how to use an application entitled

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.660 
how to use an application entitled
reflector<00:00:09.260> -<00:00:09.440> and<00:00:09.740> what's<00:00:10.250> awesome<00:00:10.370> about

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
reflector - and what's awesome about

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.970 
reflector - and what's awesome about
reflector<00:00:11.389> -<00:00:11.629> is<00:00:11.930> that<00:00:12.260> it<00:00:12.410> allows<00:00:12.650> you<00:00:12.830> to

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
reflector - is that it allows you to

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.970 
reflector - is that it allows you to
mirror<00:00:13.250> both<00:00:13.400> iOS<00:00:13.879> and<00:00:13.910> Android<00:00:14.539> devices<00:00:14.980> to

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
mirror both iOS and Android devices to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.269 
mirror both iOS and Android devices to
your<00:00:16.160> PC<00:00:16.580> or<00:00:16.820> Mac<00:00:17.150> and<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.350> to<00:00:18.410> get<00:00:18.770> started<00:00:18.920> I'm

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
Android device now it's a little bit

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.969 
Android device now it's a little bit
grainy<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:53.360> terms<00:01:53.719> of<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.259> quality<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.829> the

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
grainy in terms of the quality of the

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.029 
grainy in terms of the quality of the
video<00:01:55.189> so<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:55.880> instance<00:01:56.210> if<00:01:56.329> I<00:01:56.420> jump<00:01:56.689> into<00:01:57.039> my

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
video so for instance if I jump into my

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.279 
video so for instance if I jump into my
apps<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:59.090> can<00:01:59.240> see<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.659> they're<00:01:59.840> kind<00:02:00.200> of

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
apps you can see that they're kind of

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.510 
apps you can see that they're kind of
out<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.439> focus<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.039> then<00:02:01.159> they'll<00:02:01.310> eventually

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
out of focus and then they'll eventually

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.880 
out of focus and then they'll eventually
pop<00:02:02.329> into<00:02:02.570> focus<00:02:02.899> but<00:02:03.109> the<00:02:03.229> developer<00:02:03.680> is

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
pop into focus but the developer is

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.310 
pop into focus but the developer is
working<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:06.049> should<00:02:06.289> be

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
working on that so that should be

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.810 
working on that so that should be
something<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:06.740> fixed<00:02:07.159> with<00:02:07.340> an<00:02:07.460> update

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
something that's fixed with an update
