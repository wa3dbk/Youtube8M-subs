00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.010 
Joel 58 there we go clicks slide again
and<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.830> time<00:04:41.100> is<00:04:41.250> there<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:42.570> you<00:04:42.660> can<00:04:42.840> see

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
and the time is there so you can see

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.930 
and the time is there so you can see
basically<00:04:43.260> if<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.590> touch<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.980> top<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.490> turns

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
basically if you touch the top it turns

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.390 
basically if you touch the top it turns
itself<00:04:45.270> on<00:04:45.510> so<00:04:46.410> let's<00:04:46.560> go<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.860> next<00:04:47.070> mode

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
itself on so let's go to the next mode

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.190 
itself on so let's go to the next mode
which<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.540> temperature<00:04:48.870> which<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.140> don't

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
which is the temperature which I don't

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.440 
which is the temperature which I don't
need<00:04:49.380> without<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.860> date<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.910> let's<00:04:50.940> hold<00:04:51.300> down

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
need without the date so let's hold down

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.770 
need without the date so let's hold down
the<00:04:51.630> set<00:04:51.900> button<00:04:52.140> again<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.360> says<00:04:54.600> it's

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
the set button again so it says it's

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
done so now we have a timer that's our

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.470 
done so now we have a timer that's our
logs<00:05:19.890> you<00:05:20.070> don't<00:05:20.250> care<00:05:20.400> out<00:05:20.550> but<00:05:20.790> basically

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
logs you don't care out but basically

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.150 
logs you don't care out but basically
there<00:05:21.660> you<00:05:21.780> go<00:05:22.460> yet<00:05:23.460> whether<00:05:24.410> you<00:05:25.410> get<00:05:25.620> your

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
there you go yet whether you get your

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.780 
there you go yet whether you get your
date<00:05:26.540> timer<00:05:27.540> and<00:05:27.840> all<00:05:27.900> that<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:28.680> once<00:05:29.400> you<00:05:29.550> set

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
date timer and all that so once you set

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.530 
date timer and all that so once you set
it<00:05:29.940> down<00:05:29.970> here<00:05:30.980> it's<00:05:31.980> gonna<00:05:32.610> basically<00:05:33.060> do

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
it down here it's gonna basically do

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.360 
it down here it's gonna basically do
that<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:34.020> just<00:05:34.290> by<00:05:34.500> touching<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.100> top

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
that and just by touching the top

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.630 
that and just by touching the top
because<00:05:36.120> touch-sensitive<00:05:36.800> it<00:05:37.800> turns<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.400> time

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
because touch-sensitive it turns to time

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.840 
because touch-sensitive it turns to time
on<00:05:39.380> all<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.560> time<00:05:40.800> but<00:05:40.980> i<00:05:41.040> mean<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.340> time<00:05:41.580> that

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
on all the time but i mean the time that

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.900 
on all the time but i mean the time that
it<00:05:42.780> is<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.470> even<00:05:43.919> if<00:05:44.040> you<00:05:44.190> set<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.460> in<00:05:44.610> a

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
it is and even if you set it in a

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.240 
it is and even if you set it in a
different<00:05:45.270> mode<00:05:46.310> like<00:05:47.310> like<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:48.060> year<00:05:48.300> here

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
different mode like like the year here

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.760 
different mode like like the year here
you<00:05:50.250> mean<00:05:50.520> you<00:05:50.640> said<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:51.000> in<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.270> position

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
you mean you said it in that position

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.960 
you mean you said it in that position
there<00:05:52.770> you<00:05:52.890> go<00:05:52.979> your<00:05:53.190> same<00:05:53.400> thing<00:05:53.640> so

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
there you go your same thing so

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.530 
there you go your same thing so
basically<00:05:54.200> when<00:05:55.200> you<00:05:55.229> wobble<00:05:55.740> it<00:05:56.270> it<00:05:57.270> will

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
basically when you wobble it it will

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.390 
basically when you wobble it it will
