00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.280
 welcome 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.950
 a class 12 today we see that 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.960
 Abbott 970 pro3 mainboard 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.300
 this is a 1 3 plus board which the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.340
 amd 970 chipset used 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.220
 Again, this is the wheel 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.750
 970 pro3 mainboard down here is that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.470
 it of course compatible with windows 7 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.870
 is 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.640
 amd crossfirex is supported then 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.500
 that would be the vision of success 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.200
 which is actually a combination of 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.120
 an amd video card with an amd fx 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.180
 processor is and yes as before 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.340
 said it's the amd 970 chipset 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.530
 is not the flagship model 990fx 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.150
 Do not forget traders nested 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.100
 There are many details about the functions 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.110
 Here you can even get a picture of sports 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.610
 Counting on the day before all in all 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.800
 be a decent number of 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.600
 features for the price bid when I am 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.970
 Now the box more often seen holding 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.040
 first standard answer had gone 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.720
 but it was not color coordinated 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.129
 cheap produced but it is ok for 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.380
 on board in this price range 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.540
 then here are two sata 6gb each 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.370
 second cable very nice but unfortunately 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.500
 all that you get for sata cables 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.330
 Next time I would see something more 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.400
 want because with only two cables can of 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.870
 perpetrators become scarce and thus one would have to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.460
 then buy extra cable 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.159
 this is a description like that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.950
 ex almost 55 function works very well 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.080
 nice that's the us rock 970 per 3 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.610
 software setup then is here 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.830
 another instruction which the fast 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.049
 Installation instructions would be and this is 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.790
 Of course, they will be really dense , too 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.619
 driver for the mainboard included 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.840
 but I would recommend the most recent 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.010
 from asrock website download and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.200
 last the mainboard one 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.850
 antistatic bag now I will 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.770
 take the word out of the bag and that 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.299
 please it feels pretty good and 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.040
 it would be a good sign 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.720
 the first impression of the layout seems 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.130
 to be good and the word is pretty 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.780
 hard and that 's great 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.759
 so it will not bend so easily 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.350
 Okay, but now I'll show you that 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.240
 entire mainboard of different 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.130
 Immediately I can tell you that 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.750
 board looks absolutely great for the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.790
 Price from it does not look general 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.380
 great but forgetful that this 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.560
 on board with a pretty low 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.539
 Price compared with 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.430
 is all-encompassing seems the layout and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.900
 being always pretty good and wrong 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.940
 the board is really attractive 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.680
 it definitely has a good job 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.750
 done for many people with scarce 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.010
 budget like such a color scheme and 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.780
 if the performance and the functions 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.700
 Even in percent this word would be perfect 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.739
 if you think this is one 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.930
 black pcb acts is her wrong 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.040
 it's a dark brown pcb though 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.930
 you do not do that correctly on the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.480
 Pictures can see this mainboard 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.209
 used 1 3 per socket which 1 3 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.920
 plus and older 1 340 are supported 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.380
 The boat should be able to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.269
 cpu of amd with eight cores to operate 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.680
 Than really unbelievable for that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.470
 price but of course I do not want 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.390
 recommend such a cpu with the 970 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.280
 chips has to operate because the cpu 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.959
 simply reach their maximum performance 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.970
 and thus you get less 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.410
 performance but four nuclear then maybe 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.400
 even six scanners should not be a problem 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.049
 represent 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 as a working memory are a four 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.160
 ddr3 dimms available 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.099
 digital technology supported 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.120
 one can maximally 32 gb memory this 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.980
 install board 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.160
 the supported frequencies amount 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.930
 from 800 to 2100 on uc what 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.820
 is pretty high now to the tender 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.620
 Connect immediately as you can see 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.480
 this is standard sata 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.579
 Do not connect like that to something 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.959
 more expensive boards you already know that with 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.290
 a right angle on the right 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.940
 Time 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.010
 instead, the connections are very 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.720
 just position yourself down here 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.160
 two scart connectors and the position 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.230
 is not bad at all but that comes 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.000
 Also on how big her housing is 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.340
 let's say you want the dvd drive 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.170
 do not mix with the hard drives and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.060
 up here are four more connections 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.829
 So together that would have had six 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.739
 six gigabits per second connections 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.230
 which of the amd sb950 southbridge 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.530
 be operated now to the extension 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.709
 slots 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.200
 here are two pci express 2.0 x16 slots 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.150
 if you do not have two graphics cards from amd 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.549
 a video because it is not supported 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.709
 to run in q2 then run both 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.299
 Sticks eight if you only have one 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.489
 you should use the graphics card 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.900
 first smart use so that the gpu on 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.700
 x16 is operated 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.920
 Here you get a pci 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.210
 express x1 slot had sent or 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.380
 other extensions 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.330
 but as you may know 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.920
 some cards get bigger and we need them 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.420
 the extra space of the heat sink 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.130
 is taken as it looks quite 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.350
 after that, as if that was not enough 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.000
 Then the heat sink could have covered 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.340
 Cold hands though easy 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.870
 could not use a x16 slot though 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.580
 not when you distribute a circle 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.130
 not to forget here then gets 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.660
 also two standard pci slots now 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.000
 to the internal connections 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.220
 here is the power led connection here 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.510
 is the front panel connection and before 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.240
 I forget here is the speaker 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.360
 connection then here is the tr and usb 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.680
 2.0 connection 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.450
 Of course you get two more usb 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.370
 connections so that is very nice and 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.770
 Here is the com connection because I too 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.110
 known as serial port that is here 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.270
 is the hdmi slash spd im 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.220
 connection under front panel hd audio 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.380
 connection so well now I'll show you 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.960
 the air connections and their positions 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.990
 up here are the digits 1 and cpu of 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.300
 two connections there is from 11 1 1 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.820
 down there the jazz fan 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.850
 2-port and finally the jazz fan 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.410
 1 connection over here the 24 volt 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.510
 electricity is located here at the 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.940
 ideal place exactly like on the axpo 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.370
 latteks 12 volt power connection up there 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.290
 this sport 1 4 +1 face paul design 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.970
 and to supply the cpu with electricity and 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.980
 as you can see will be high quality 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.960
 So the components used should be 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.970
 lifetime and to be quite high 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.830
 keeping everything cool are two bodies here 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.870
 flow in on the northbridge 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.850
 including the southbridge, however 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.890
 unfortunately , none has decided for it 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.930
 to place heat sink on the video 1 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.700
 So we definitely overclock that 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.200
 limit but I think that one 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.970
 anyway no good overclocking 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.010
 results from a mainboard in this 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.280
 Price can expect this port 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.020
 used realtech ag 892 hd audio 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.060
 codec because it sounds pretty good 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.860
 all reproduction now plate back 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.110
 so good with the connections so here 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.660
 once or twice and closed 1 ps 2 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.480
 keyboard connection two usb 2.0 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.000
 Connections two more usb 2.0 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.850
 Connections a gigabit lan connection and 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.920
 two more USB 2.0 then connect 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.910
 you also get two usb 3.0 ports 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.889
 and 7.1 audio what about realtech 892 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.050
 audio.de 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.219
 it's going to be good now it's time 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.050
 turn on mainboard 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.849
 this is the post screen which is very nice 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.930
 looks like with the high resolution picture 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.490
 here it is , obviously it is 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.379
 So only the latest technology has 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.629
 used for the price and it is 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.159
 You can do very well in a fe bikes 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.689
 either with the keyboard as you would it 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.490
 was used to navigate or else 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.229
 simply with the mouse the graphic 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.819
 user interface also seems pretty 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.680
 to be good but to navigate with that 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.060
 Mouse is a little difficult that is so 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.650
 a kind of delay and the 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.360
 Response time is not the best though 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.279
 it is good enough for the price 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.020
 the rp at should be great for beginners 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:52.729
 be easier to use and then 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.710
 here you get many options whatever 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.879
 good sign is now i store 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.909
 do not have the settings and 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:00.889
 So leave that to 970 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.659
 Pro3 mainboard is a great choice 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.279
 if you 're tight budget and off 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.840
 Still good features and a good one 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.509
 want to have looking mainboard 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.050
 of course it's the amd 970 chipset 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.219
 and this slower than 990fx chipset 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.779
 so this mainboard is not that 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.430
 Best choice for processors with eight 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.589
 cores because of hypertransport only 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.270
 speeds up to 48 glued 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:21.949
 through which could let through but for 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.689
 four no, maybe six, cores 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.460
 no problem should be all right 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:27.050
 but that work with the hyper 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.259
 transport limit is just a matter of 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.389
 amd 970 chipset this limited 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.039
 performance but all-encompassing offers this 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:36.439
 assad mainboard great features 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.120
 and performance for the price advantages 

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:41.000
 would be great price 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.009
 performance ratio good layout then 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.729
 It has a good number of functions 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:48.550
 It also has a good color scheme and 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:51.319
 Also support a memory up to 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.149
 2,100 megahertz as a disadvantage I can 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:55.250
 just call one that navigate with the 

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:56.779
 Out in the uefa it can be difficult 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.460
 Apart from that , this is rated 

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:59.539
 mainboard with nine out of ten and like that 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.129
 definitely recommend 

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:03.610
 thanks for watching and do not forget
