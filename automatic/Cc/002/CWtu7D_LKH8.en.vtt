and

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.140 

now<00:00:12.840> we've<00:00:13.080> decided<00:00:13.619> we're<00:00:14.010> IRAs<00:00:14.429> planting

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
now we've decided we're IRAs planting

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.540 
now we've decided we're IRAs planting
and<00:00:15.360> iers<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.840> horeb<00:00:16.110> landscaping<00:00:16.770> are<00:00:16.919> we<00:00:17.400> can

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and iers of horeb landscaping are we can

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.130 
and iers of horeb landscaping are we can
start<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:17.939> about<00:00:18.150> points<00:00:18.689> of<00:00:18.779> interest

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
start to think about points of interest

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.920 
start to think about points of interest
now<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.980> always<00:00:20.460> start<00:00:20.910> by<00:00:20.970> thinking<00:00:21.090> about<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
now I always start by thinking about the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.870 
now I always start by thinking about the
windows<00:00:22.349> and<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> doors<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> house<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
windows and the doors of the house the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.580 
windows and the doors of the house the
way<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.090> look<00:00:24.210> out<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.539> garden<00:00:24.750> after<00:00:25.020> all

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
way we look out to the garden after all

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.139 
way we look out to the garden after all
we<00:00:25.710> are<00:00:25.739> in<00:00:26.040> England<00:00:26.309> so<00:00:26.520> we<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.820> probably

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149 
we are in England so we are probably

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.970 
we are in England so we are probably
going<00:00:27.540> to<00:00:27.660> spend<00:00:27.899> more<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.320> inside<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
going to spend more time inside the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.620 
going to spend more time inside the
house<00:00:29.099> looking<00:00:29.430> at<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.669> garden<00:00:29.969> than<00:00:30.360> outside

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
house looking at the garden than outside

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.000 
house looking at the garden than outside
enjoying<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:32.420> one<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.629> most<00:00:34.010> important

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
enjoying it one of the most important

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
enjoying it one of the most important
windows<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
windows I like to think about is the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049 
windows I like to think about is the
view<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.379> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> kitchen<00:00:38.309> especially<00:00:38.730> if

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
view out of the kitchen especially if

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.310 
view out of the kitchen especially if
you've<00:00:39.210> got<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> sink<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.870> front<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you've got a sink in front of the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.020 
you've got a sink in front of the
kitchen<00:00:40.469> window<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.220> know<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:41.970> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
kitchen window I know that's where I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.960 
kitchen window I know that's where I
spend<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:42.660> time<00:00:42.900> now<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
spend a lot of my time now that is a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.390 
spend a lot of my time now that is a
really<00:00:45.329> important<00:00:46.260> Vista<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.980> need<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
really important Vista that you need to

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.880 
really important Vista that you need to
make<00:00:47.970> sure<00:00:48.000> looks<00:00:48.360> good<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.750> year<00:00:49.079> round<00:00:49.290> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
make sure looks good all year round so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.160 
make sure looks good all year round so
if<00:00:50.130> my<00:00:50.280> kitchen<00:00:50.640> windows<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.450> I'm<00:00:51.870> tend

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
if my kitchen windows here and I'm tend

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.780 
if my kitchen windows here and I'm tend
to<00:00:52.290> be<00:00:52.380> looking<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.710> straight<00:00:53.010> ahead<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.399> might

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
to be looking out straight ahead I might

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.940 
to be looking out straight ahead I might
choose<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.270> put<00:00:54.450> something<00:00:54.720> for<00:00:55.380> my<00:00:55.500> point<00:00:55.860> of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
choose to put something for my point of

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.220 
choose to put something for my point of
interest<00:00:56.450> immediately<00:00:57.450> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> eyeline<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
interest immediately in the eyeline of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
interest immediately in the eyeline of
that<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.950> this<00:00:59.190> case<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.730> might<00:00:59.970> go<00:01:00.120> something

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that in this case I might go something

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
that in this case I might go something
like<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.630> tree<00:01:01.050> which<00:01:01.230> has<00:01:01.440> year<00:01:01.680> round

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
like a tree which has year round

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
like a tree which has year round
structure<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.550> could<00:01:02.910> pick<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> small<00:01:03.420> tree<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
structure I could pick a small tree that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.499 
structure I could pick a small tree that
would<00:01:03.989> suit<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.530> smaller<00:01:05.189> space<00:01:05.549> won't<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.360> too

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
would suit a smaller space won't get too

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.389 
would suit a smaller space won't get too
big<00:01:06.810> perhaps<00:01:07.350> something<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> has<00:01:08.009> several

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
big perhaps something that has several

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.399 
big perhaps something that has several
seasons<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> interest<00:01:09.270> maybe<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> beautiful

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
seasons of interest maybe a beautiful

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.070 
seasons of interest maybe a beautiful
shape<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.009> interesting<00:01:11.969> bark<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.630> either

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
shape and interesting bark and either

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
shape and interesting bark and either
blossom<00:01:13.620> or<00:01:13.710> berries<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.220> top<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.640> all<00:01:14.760> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
blossom or berries on top of all that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.390 
blossom or berries on top of all that
that<00:01:15.450> way<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:17.070> something

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that way I can have something

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
that way I can have something
interesting<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.970> look<00:01:18.120> at<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.510> year<00:01:18.750> round

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
interesting to look at all year round

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.719 
interesting to look at all year round
and<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.830> might<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:19.979> something<00:01:20.370> I<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.490> even

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and it might be something I can even

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.880 
and it might be something I can even
consider<00:01:21.000> lighting<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.260> that<00:01:22.470> even<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
consider lighting so that even in the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.440 
consider lighting so that even in the
evening<00:01:23.370> when<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> rest<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.000> garden<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
evening when the rest of the garden is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
evening when the rest of the garden is
dark<00:01:24.840> I've<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.590> something<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
dark I've got something there a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
dark I've got something there a
silhouette<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.360> concentrate<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
silhouette that I can concentrate on the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
silhouette that I can concentrate on the
great<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.610> putting<00:01:30.330> points<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
great thing about putting points of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.359 
great thing about putting points of
interest<00:01:31.110> within<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.590> garden<00:01:31.920> rather<00:01:32.220> than

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
interest within the garden rather than

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.490 
interest within the garden rather than
limiting<00:01:32.820> them<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.240> perimeter<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
limiting them to the perimeter is that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
limiting them to the perimeter is that
you<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.770> extra<00:01:34.950> value<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.640> money<00:01:35.760> you<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you get extra value for money you get to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.149 
you get extra value for money you get to
appreciate<00:01:36.810> them<00:01:37.200> from<00:01:37.380> several<00:01:37.830> different

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
appreciate them from several different

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
appreciate them from several different
points<00:01:38.310> within<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.909> garden<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.570> only

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
points within the garden not only

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.600 
points within the garden not only
looking<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.890> from<00:01:41.070> inside<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
looking out on them from inside the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.480 
looking out on them from inside the
house<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.299> also<00:01:42.450> looking<00:01:42.840> back<00:01:42.900> on<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.950> from

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
house but also looking back on them from

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
house but also looking back on them from
within<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.119> garden<00:01:45.270> itself<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> great

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
within the garden itself it's a great

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.670 
within the garden itself it's a great
way<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.189> add<00:01:47.640> extra<00:01:48.119> bang<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.600> buck<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
way to add extra bang for your buck it's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
way to add extra bang for your buck it's
always<00:01:50.010> nice<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> tree<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
always nice to have a tree because it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.490 
always nice to have a tree because it
gives<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> height<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.080> really

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
gives you height and that's really

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
gives you height and that's really
important<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> success<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.970> your<00:01:54.119> garden

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
important in the success of your garden

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
important in the success of your garden
design<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.890> we've<00:01:56.100> spent<00:01:56.460> most<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.850> time<00:01:57.060> so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
design now we've spent most the time so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.060 
design now we've spent most the time so
far<00:01:57.450> concentrating<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> ground<00:01:58.619> playing

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
far concentrating on the ground playing

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
far concentrating on the ground playing
and<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.939> we've<00:02:00.060> got<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.330> right<00:02:00.509> we

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and now that we've got that right we

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.120 
and now that we've got that right we
really<00:02:00.900> need<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.439> about<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.799> garden<00:02:02.070> in

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
really need to think about the garden in

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.039 
really need to think about the garden in
three<00:02:02.400> dimensions<00:02:03.090> there<00:02:03.720> are<00:02:03.840> lots<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
three dimensions there are lots of

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.359 
three dimensions there are lots of
different<00:02:04.320> ways<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.470> can<00:02:04.740> introduce<00:02:04.979> height

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
different ways you can introduce height

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.830 
different ways you can introduce height
into<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> garden<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.000> doesn't<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
into the garden it doesn't just have to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.229 
into the garden it doesn't just have to
be<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.110> tree<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.340> about<00:02:08.459> areas<00:02:08.909> on

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
be a tree you can think about areas on

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
be a tree you can think about areas on
the<00:02:09.360> boundary<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.019> you<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.500> about<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the boundary so you can think about the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
the boundary so you can think about the
fences<00:02:11.549> or<00:02:11.909> considering<00:02:12.480> putting<00:02:12.689> hedges<00:02:13.110> in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
fences or considering putting hedges in

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.080 
fences or considering putting hedges in
if<00:02:13.470> you've<00:02:14.069> got<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> beautiful<00:02:14.519> landscape

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
if you've got a beautiful landscape

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
if you've got a beautiful landscape
beyond<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.140> focus<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> borrowed

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
beyond you can focus on the borrowed

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.050 
beyond you can focus on the borrowed
landscape

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
landscape

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.900

you<00:02:18.270> can<00:02:18.510> imagine<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.800> view<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.400> frame<00:02:20.700> the

view beyond your own garden if the view
is<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.790> little<00:02:23.910> less<00:02:24.780> beautiful<00:02:25.290> perhaps

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.470

you'll<00:02:26.370> want<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.670> concentrate<00:02:27.090> your

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
you'll want to concentrate your

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.510 
you'll want to concentrate your

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
viewpoint within the garden itself so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.770 
viewpoint within the garden itself so
you'll<00:02:29.670> be<00:02:29.790> wanting<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.209> think<00:02:30.510> about

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
you'll be wanting to think about

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.140 
you'll be wanting to think about
potential<00:02:31.170> screening<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.190> directing<00:02:32.940> all

potential screening and directing all

potential screening and directing all
the<00:02:33.480> attention<00:02:34.459> inside<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.760> garden<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.330> that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the attention inside the garden in that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.440 
the attention inside the garden in that
case<00:02:36.989> will<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.099> slightly<00:02:38.340> more<00:02:38.640> limited<00:02:39.150> by

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
case will be slightly more limited by

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 
case will be slightly more limited by
legal<00:02:40.200> planning<00:02:40.560> requirements<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.130> mean<00:02:41.310> we

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
legal planning requirements that mean we

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.890 
legal planning requirements that mean we
can't<00:02:41.670> actually<00:02:41.970> put<00:02:42.209> any<00:02:42.330> structures<00:02:42.780> in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
can't actually put any structures in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.890 
can't actually put any structures in
over<00:02:43.110> 1.8<00:02:43.650> meters<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.790> again<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.599> is<00:02:45.750> where

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
over 1.8 meters so again this is where

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.540 
over 1.8 meters so again this is where
trees<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.500> shrubs<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.099> come<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.400> handy

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
trees and shrubs can come in handy

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.240 
trees and shrubs can come in handy
because<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.150> can<00:02:48.300> put<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.660> taller<00:02:49.319> planted

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
because we can put in taller planted

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.130 
because we can put in taller planted
specimens<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> screening<00:02:51.930> job

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
specimens to do the screening job

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.440 
specimens to do the screening job
forests<00:02:52.590> now<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> lot<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.910> us<00:02:54.000> will<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.420> a

good width of border you can do that

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.589 
good width of border you can do that
quite<00:03:14.160> successfully<00:03:14.849> even<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.390> small

that<00:03:17.670> I've<00:03:17.819> designed<00:03:18.299> my<00:03:18.390> layout<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.989> I

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
that I've designed my layout that I

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.020 
that I've designed my layout that I
actually<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.560> some<00:03:19.709> nice<00:03:19.920> big<00:03:20.430> areas<00:03:21.000> of

going to perhaps be 40 60 maybe a little
bit<00:03:36.299> taller<00:03:36.510> things<00:03:37.319> like<00:03:37.500> tulips<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:38.160> pop<00:03:38.400> up

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
bit taller things like tulips can pop up

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.890 
bit taller things like tulips can pop up
through<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:38.940> which<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.239> going<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> be<00:03:39.569> really

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
through that which is going to be really

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.449 
through that which is going to be really
lovely<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.380> then<00:03:40.739> towards<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.130> back<00:03:41.310> I'm

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
lovely and then towards the back I'm

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.979 
lovely and then towards the back I'm
going<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.730> have<00:03:41.850> my<00:03:42.000> taller<00:03:42.269> perennials<00:03:42.810> and

going to have my taller perennials and

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.380 
going to have my taller perennials and
maybe<00:03:43.170> even<00:03:43.500> some<00:03:43.680> shrubs<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.340> parts<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
maybe even some shrubs in parts of the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.270 
maybe even some shrubs in parts of the
garden<00:03:45.690> where<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.170> can<00:03:46.470> see<00:03:46.650> I've<00:03:46.799> got<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> lot

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
garden where you can see I've got a lot

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.110 
garden where you can see I've got a lot
less<00:03:48.079> width<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.530> work<00:03:49.709> with<00:03:50.100> I'm<00:03:50.430> going<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
less width to work with I'm going to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.520 
less width to work with I'm going to
have<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.359> be<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> bit<00:03:51.660> more<00:03:51.810> careful<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.230> just

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
have to be a bit more careful I just

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.920 
have to be a bit more careful I just
don't<00:03:52.859> have<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.370> room<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.639> start<00:03:54.209> grading<00:03:54.630> my

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
don't have the room to start grading my

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.530 
don't have the room to start grading my
planting<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.340> case<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.450> to

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
planting and in this case it's going to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.000 
planting and in this case it's going to
be<00:03:57.630> really<00:03:57.840> important<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.560> be<00:03:58.709> able<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.920> get

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
be really important to be able to get

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.240 
be really important to be able to get
the<00:03:59.130> height<00:03:59.370> really<00:03:59.790> quickly<00:04:00.859> something<00:04:01.859> like

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the height really quickly something like

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.580 
the height really quickly something like
a<00:04:02.489> wool<00:04:02.850> trained<00:04:03.209> climber<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.930> perfect<00:04:04.440> for

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
a wool trained climber is perfect for

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.740 
a wool trained climber is perfect for
this<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.250> actually<00:04:05.600> plant<00:04:06.600> these

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
this you can actually plant these

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.120 
this you can actually plant these
yourself<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.319> train<00:04:07.530> them<00:04:07.650> up<00:04:07.739> your<00:04:07.950> fence

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
yourself and train them up your fence

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.580 
yourself and train them up your fence
but<00:04:08.819> if<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.060> want<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.389> cheat<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.410> also

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
but if you want to cheat you can also

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590 
but if you want to cheat you can also
buy<00:04:10.950> them<00:04:11.130> pre-trained<00:04:11.670> onto<00:04:11.940> frames<00:04:12.239> which

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
buy them pre-trained onto frames which

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.660 
buy them pre-trained onto frames which
gives<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.959> nice<00:04:13.290> instant<00:04:14.069> effect<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.579> will

they're going to get very very leggy and
the<00:04:35.430> whole<00:04:35.669> thing<00:04:35.909> will<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.060> look<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.419> a

the whole thing will just look like a
mess<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.470> if<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.800> have<00:04:38.099> a<00:04:38.370> narrow<00:04:38.909> error<00:04:39.360> of

mess so if you have a narrow error of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.050 
mess so if you have a narrow error of
planting<00:04:40.080> go<00:04:40.560> for<00:04:40.830> something<00:04:41.010> simpler<00:04:41.849> and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
planting go for something simpler and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.060 
planting go for something simpler and
concentrate<00:04:42.960> on<00:04:42.990> doing<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.470> more<00:04:43.620> complex

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
concentrate on doing the more complex

concentrate on doing the more complex
planting<00:04:44.610> in<00:04:44.789> your<00:04:44.970> nice<00:04:45.090> big<00:04:45.360> areas<00:04:46.039> so<00:04:47.039> to

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
planting in your nice big areas so to

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.640

recap<00:04:47.750> designing<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.780> garden<00:04:49.140> is<00:04:49.229> actually<00:04:49.590> a

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
recap designing a garden is actually a

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.070 
recap designing a garden is actually a
very<00:04:50.010> simple<00:04:50.310> process<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.450> start<00:04:51.510> with<00:04:51.990> the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
very simple process you start with the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.860 
very simple process you start with the
basic<00:04:52.470> outline<00:04:52.800> of<00:04:52.830> your<00:04:53.099> garden<00:04:53.870> remembering

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
basic outline of your garden remembering

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.810 
basic outline of your garden remembering
to<00:04:55.020> put<00:04:55.050> your<00:04:55.289> hands<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.710> course<00:04:55.890> then<00:04:56.610> you

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
to put your hands in of course then you

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.300 
to put your hands in of course then you
start<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.330> fill<00:04:57.539> those<00:04:57.750> shapes<00:04:58.080> with<00:04:58.560> squares

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
start to fill those shapes with squares
