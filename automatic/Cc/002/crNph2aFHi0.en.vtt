demonstration

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.080 

hey<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.610> do<00:00:59.700> is<00:00:59.910> make

hey you know what you want to do is make

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
hey you know what you want to do is make
a<00:01:00.329> V<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> bottom<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.770> cutting<00:01:01.950> like

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
a V at the bottom with your cutting like

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.930 
a V at the bottom with your cutting like
so<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.280> we're<00:01:11.400> gonna<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.850> we're

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
so and then what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.490 
so and then what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> match<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.810> seedling<00:01:13.229> or

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
going to match it up to the seedling or

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:28.950 
going to match it up to the seedling or
your<00:01:13.979> red<00:01:14.100> stock

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:42.140 

so<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.080> looks<00:01:30.259> like<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.440> B<00:01:32.799> term<00:01:33.799> together

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.610 

they<00:01:43.150> took<00:01:43.270> out<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.870> know<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.590> know

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
they took out you know it's you know

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.280 
they took out you know it's you know
it's<00:01:44.800> a<00:01:45.400> good<00:01:45.760> bit<00:01:45.970> when<00:01:46.150> they<00:01:46.300> stays<00:01:47.110> by

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
it's a good bit when they stays by

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's a good bit when they stays by
itself<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:49.390> could<00:01:49.540> wrapped<00:01:49.690> in<00:01:49.810> tape<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.290> if

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
itself they could wrapped in tape and if

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.620 
itself they could wrapped in tape and if
you<00:01:50.560> stretch<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:51.010> little<00:01:51.040> bit<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:52.360> makes<00:01:52.480> it

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
you stretch it a little bit it makes it

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:01.320 
you stretch it a little bit it makes it
easier<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:52.990> work<00:01:53.110> with<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:01.030> what<00:02:01.210> you're

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
easier to work with then what you're

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.470 
easier to work with then what you're
gonna<00:02:01.420> do<00:02:01.540> is<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.660> wrap<00:02:01.930> them<00:02:02.110> around<00:02:03.480> you

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
gonna do is just wrap them around you

okay<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.780> wrap<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.380> around<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.890> Grafton

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
okay so we wrap that around the Grafton

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.720 
okay so we wrap that around the Grafton
tape

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.890 

and<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.849> was<00:02:38.030> what<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.329> want<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.659> is<00:02:38.780> take

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
your rubber band cut it down wrap it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:03:06.760 
your rubber band cut it down wrap it
around

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.060 

any<00:03:07.770> tiny<00:03:07.980> knot<00:03:10.730> then<00:03:11.730> what<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:13.070> take

any tiny knot then what you do is take

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.190 
any tiny knot then what you do is take
your<00:03:14.130> green<00:03:14.730> garden<00:03:15.120> tight<00:03:15.330> a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.180 

and<00:03:23.200> then<00:03:23.320> wrap<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.740> around<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.040> rubber

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
and then wrap that around the rubber

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.570 
and then wrap that around the rubber
band<00:03:25.290> because<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.560> rubber<00:03:26.710> bands<00:03:27.010> get<00:03:27.340> they

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
band because the rubber bands get they

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.000 
band because the rubber bands get they
do<00:03:27.730> get<00:03:27.880> brittle<00:03:28.300> in<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.480> Sun<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.680> then<00:03:29.860> they

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
do get brittle in the Sun and then they

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.300 
do get brittle in the Sun and then they
they<00:03:30.970> fall<00:03:31.180> off

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
they fall off

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.800 
they fall off
started<00:03:33.310> somehow<00:03:33.700> this<00:03:34.210> will<00:03:34.390> keep<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.630> from

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
started somehow this will keep that from

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.950 
started somehow this will keep that from
happening

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.310 

as<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.740> gives<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.040> in<00:03:40.130> snap<00:03:40.610> fit<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.990> then<00:03:45.140> just

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
as it gives it in snap fit and then just

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:54.559 
as it gives it in snap fit and then just
tie<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.500> knot

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.159 

there<00:03:55.469> you<00:03:55.859> have<00:03:56.129> it
