00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
biodynamic farm you should be able to

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.029 
biodynamic farm you should be able to
see<00:00:27.489> all<00:00:27.759> four<00:00:28.090> of<00:00:28.210> these<00:00:28.329> no<00:00:28.630> matter<00:00:29.410> where

see all four of these no matter where

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.180 
see all four of these no matter where
you<00:00:30.279> are<00:00:30.489> in<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:30.939> world<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:32.140> first<00:00:32.410> is<00:00:32.829> that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
you are in the world the first is that

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.979 
you are in the world the first is that
you<00:00:33.489> try<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:36.010> create<00:00:36.339> as<00:00:36.730> closely<00:00:37.390> as<00:00:37.659> possible

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
you try to create as closely as possible

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.100 
you try to create as closely as possible
a<00:00:38.920> closed<00:00:39.519> system<00:00:39.879> in<00:00:40.390> reference<00:00:41.019> to

a closed system in reference to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.360 
a closed system in reference to
nutrients<00:00:41.949> so<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:43.680> practical<00:00:44.680> outcome<00:00:44.829> of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
nutrients so the practical outcome of

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.060 
nutrients so the practical outcome of
that<00:00:45.399> is<00:00:46.030> that<00:00:46.269> you<00:00:46.479> become<00:00:47.070> extremely

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
that is that you become extremely

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.660 
that is that you become extremely
conscientious<00:00:48.929> about<00:00:49.929> how<00:00:50.469> you<00:00:50.530> handle<00:00:51.489> your

conscientious about how you handle your

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.590 
conscientious about how you handle your
natural<00:00:52.239> resource<00:00:52.660> base<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.519> so<00:00:54.519> what<00:00:55.449> you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
natural resource base and so what you

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.740 
natural resource base and so what you
want<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.929> do<00:00:56.079> is<00:00:56.379> organize<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.879> natural

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
want to do is organize your natural

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.709 
want to do is organize your natural
resource<00:00:59.170> base<00:00:59.289> so<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.429> it<00:01:00.550> supports<00:01:00.910> this

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
resource base so that it supports this

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.930 
resource base so that it supports this
piece<00:01:02.019> of<00:01:02.230> property<00:01:02.589> that<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.920> have<00:01:03.070> all

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
piece of property that you have all

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.109 
piece of property that you have all
organic<00:01:04.899> matter<00:01:04.929> goes<00:01:05.860> through<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.250> composting

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
organic matter goes through a composting

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.620 
organic matter goes through a composting
system<00:01:07.830> recycling<00:01:08.830> of<00:01:08.979> water<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.390> just

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
system recycling of water you just

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.200 
system recycling of water you just
become<00:01:11.020> aware<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:12.310> waste<00:01:12.670> stream<00:01:13.179> that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
become aware of the waste stream that

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.200 
become aware of the waste stream that
you<00:01:13.659> create<00:01:14.380> in<00:01:14.679> your<00:01:14.740> farming<00:01:15.580> enterprise

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
you create in your farming enterprise

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.740 
you create in your farming enterprise
and<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:17.140> capture<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.550> turn<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.509> into

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
and you capture that and turn it into

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.410 
and you capture that and turn it into
your<00:01:19.990> fertility<00:01:20.560> stream<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.210> is

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
your fertility stream so this is

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
your fertility stream so this is
principle<00:01:22.960> number<00:01:23.170> one<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:24.810> cannot<00:01:25.810> be

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
principle number one it cannot be

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.280 
principle number one it cannot be
executed<00:01:29.579> 100%<00:01:30.579> but<00:01:31.119> that's<00:01:31.360> not<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:32.020> point

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
executed 100% but that's not the point

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.550 
executed 100% but that's not the point
the<00:01:32.729> nature<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.759> Agriculture<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.320> is

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
the nature of Agriculture is that it is

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.580 
the nature of Agriculture is that it is
exploitive<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.610> so<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:37.960> have<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.409> be

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
exploitive and so you have to be

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.200 
exploitive and so you have to be
extremely<00:01:39.219> realistic<00:01:39.820> about<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.960> whole

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
extremely realistic about this whole

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.580 
extremely realistic about this whole
input/output<00:01:43.210> system<00:01:43.930> that<00:01:44.409> you're

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
input/output system that you're

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.770 
input/output system that you're
developing<00:01:45.600> again

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
developing again

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.429 
developing again
grapes<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.820> easier<00:01:49.240> crops<00:01:49.600> again

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
grapes is one of the easier crops again

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.130 
grapes is one of the easier crops again
because<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.100> focus<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:51.850> quality<00:01:52.450> you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
because the focus is on quality you

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.310 
because the focus is on quality you
don't<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:53.560> large<00:01:54.009> yields<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.119> as<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.780> yields

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
don't have large yields so as the yields

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.399 
don't have large yields so as the yields
drop<00:01:56.710> your<00:01:57.579> nutrient<00:01:58.210> loss<00:01:58.450> drops<00:01:59.079> in

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
drop your nutrient loss drops in

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.139 
drop your nutrient loss drops in
proportion<00:02:00.399> with<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.530> know<00:02:02.680> at

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
proportion with it and so you know at

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.130 
proportion with it and so you know at
around<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:05.079> know<00:02:05.200> 3<00:02:05.740> tons<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.579> acre<00:02:07.140> give

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
around you know 3 tons to the acre give

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.660 
around you know 3 tons to the acre give
our<00:02:08.729> -<00:02:10.079> you're<00:02:11.079> not<00:02:11.260> dealing<00:02:11.590> with<00:02:11.829> very<00:02:12.430> large

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
our - you're not dealing with very large

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.880 
our - you're not dealing with very large
losses<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:14.019> is<00:02:14.200> something<00:02:14.650> that's<00:02:14.769> very

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
losses so this is something that's very

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.539 
losses so this is something that's very
realistic<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:16.680> other<00:02:17.680> crops<00:02:18.010> where<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.400> have

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
realistic in other crops where you have

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.270 
realistic in other crops where you have
really<00:02:19.150> high<00:02:19.320> nutrients<00:02:20.320> like<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.190> example

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
really high nutrients like for example

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.170 
really high nutrients like for example
with<00:02:21.790> bananas<00:02:22.480> where<00:02:23.410> you're<00:02:23.799> pulling<00:02:24.730> 20

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
with bananas where you're pulling 20

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.770 
with bananas where you're pulling 20
tons<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.829> acre<00:02:27.070> off<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.419> see<00:02:28.570> how

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
tons to the acre off you can see how

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.680 
tons to the acre off you can see how
difficult<00:02:29.109> it<00:02:29.680> would<00:02:29.889> be<00:02:29.949> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
difficult it would be to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.350 
difficult it would be to
maintain<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.080> level<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.980> production<00:02:32.490> with<00:02:33.330> a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
maintain that level of production with a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.310 
maintain that level of production with a
closed<00:02:33.780> system<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.950> reference<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.520> nutrients

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
closed system and reference to nutrients

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:47.370 
closed system and reference to nutrients
not<00:02:37.490> realistically<00:02:38.490> possible
