them<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.850> invert

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
them at all and because you can invert

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.959 
them at all and because you can invert
the<00:01:57.600> colors<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.680> actually<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.670> 12

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
the colors you actually can get 12

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.760 
the colors you actually can get 12
different<00:02:00.270> watch<00:02:00.540> faces<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.170> then<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.680> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
different watch faces and then if you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.440 
different watch faces and then if you
slot<00:02:02.040> go<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> side<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.969> actually<00:02:03.299> get

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
slot go to the side you actually get

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
slot go to the side you actually get
different<00:02:03.630> apps<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.740> reminders

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
different apps so there are reminders

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.399 
different apps so there are reminders
there's<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> calculator<00:02:06.600> there's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> lunar

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
there's a calculator there's a lunar

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.120 
there's a calculator there's a lunar
moon<00:02:07.649> phases<00:02:08.360> indicator<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.560> alarms

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
moon phases indicator you have alarms

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.050 
moon phases indicator you have alarms
world<00:02:14.370> clock<00:02:14.670> stopwatch<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.960> calendar<00:02:16.170> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
world clock stopwatch and a calendar and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.970 
world clock stopwatch and a calendar and
then<00:02:18.060> back<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.750> time<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.500> let's<00:02:19.680> look<00:02:19.770> at

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
then back to the time so let's look at

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.100 
then back to the time so let's look at
the<00:02:20.100> lunar<00:02:21.000> phase<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.480> actually<00:02:21.780> gives<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
the lunar phase it actually gives you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.690 
the lunar phase it actually gives you
the<00:02:22.230> lunar<00:02:22.440> phase<00:02:22.740> right<00:02:23.070> now<00:02:23.130> which<00:02:23.670> is

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the lunar phase right now which is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
the lunar phase right now which is
coming<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.600> religious<00:02:25.080> tradition<00:02:25.500> that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
coming out of religious tradition that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920 
coming out of religious tradition that
actually<00:02:25.950> goes<00:02:26.190> by<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.520> moon<00:02:27.000> rather<00:02:27.660> than

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
actually goes by the moon rather than

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.350 
actually goes by the moon rather than
the<00:02:28.140> Sun<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.160> actually<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.490> nice<00:02:29.880> app<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the Sun this is actually a nice app to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.470 
the Sun this is actually a nice app to
have<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.440> calculator<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.790> actually<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.240> full

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
have the calculator it's actually a full

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.810 
have the calculator it's actually a full
calculator<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:34.830> swipe<00:02:35.100> up<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.610> get

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
calculator and if you swipe up you get

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.920 
calculator and if you swipe up you get
the<00:02:36.560> functions<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:38.190> simple<00:02:38.610> not<00:02:39.450> much<00:02:39.660> to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the functions very simple not much to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470 
the functions very simple not much to
write<00:02:40.050> home<00:02:40.110> about<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.770> it's<00:02:41.070> there<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:42.300> can

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
write home about but it's there you can

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.080 
write home about but it's there you can
go<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> settings<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.550> change<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
go to the settings you can change the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.770 
go to the settings you can change the
appearance<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.680> change<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.100> sounds<00:02:50.780> it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
appearance you can change the sounds it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660 
appearance you can change the sounds it
will<00:02:51.900> chime<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> hour<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.520> don't

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
will chime on the hour now but we don't

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.030 
will chime on the hour now but we don't
want<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:55.260> have<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.560> press<00:02:55.770> tone

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
want that and you have the press tone

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.850 
want that and you have the press tone
there<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.360> actually<00:02:57.710> change<00:02:58.710> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
there you can actually change the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.280 
there you can actually change the
language<00:02:59.070> there<00:02:59.550> or<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.180> appearance<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:01.140> can

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
language there or the appearance you can

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.590 
language there or the appearance you can
actually<00:03:01.410> invert<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.040> colors<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.670> said<00:03:02.940> so

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
actually invert the colors as I said so

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.550 
actually invert the colors as I said so
now<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.290> go<00:03:04.470> back<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:11.820> now<00:03:12.000> have<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
now if you go back you now have the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.980 
now if you go back you now have the
watch<00:03:13.560> display<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.370> actually<00:03:15.360> easier<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.810> read

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
watch display is actually easier to read

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.810 
watch display is actually easier to read
a<00:03:16.200> little<00:03:16.680> bit<00:03:16.860> brighter<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.940> actually<00:03:19.820> really

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
a little bit brighter I actually really

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.430 
a little bit brighter I actually really
like<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.180> one<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:22.110> one<00:03:22.170> actually

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
like this one and this one actually

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.590 
like this one and this one actually
gives<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.010> phosphor<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.030> gives<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.420> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
gives you phosphor and it gives you the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.550 
gives you phosphor and it gives you the
date<00:03:24.810> as<00:03:24.990> well<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.960> takes<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.230> little<00:03:28.380> bit<00:03:28.500> of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
date as well so it takes a little bit of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.740 
date as well so it takes a little bit of
time<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.920> get<00:03:29.010> used<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> LCD<00:03:30.000> display<00:03:30.510> in

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
time to get used to the LCD display in

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.620 
time to get used to the LCD display in
the<00:03:30.780> touchscreen<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:32.490> was<00:03:33.000> having<00:03:33.270> trouble<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
the touchscreen I was having trouble the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.150 
the touchscreen I was having trouble the
first<00:03:33.660> time<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.050> shot<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.380> video<00:03:34.560> it's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
first time I shot this video it's

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.100 
first time I shot this video it's
actually<00:03:35.340> much<00:03:35.640> easier<00:03:35.700> now<00:03:36.120> even<00:03:36.780> though<00:03:36.930> I'm

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
actually much easier now even though I'm

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.630 
actually much easier now even though I'm
actually<00:03:37.290> behind<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.920> camera<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.280> trying<00:03:38.580> to

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
actually behind the camera and trying to

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.940 
actually behind the camera and trying to
reach<00:03:38.820> over<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.390> this<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.740> works

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
reach over and do this and it works

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.170 
reach over and do this and it works
really<00:03:41.070> nicely<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.670> don't<00:03:41.940> need<00:03:42.150> a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
really nicely if you don't need a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.630 
really nicely if you don't need a
SmartWatch<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.709> do<00:03:43.950> want<00:03:44.160> something

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
SmartWatch but you do want something

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.600 
SmartWatch but you do want something
that<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.870> customizable<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.200> fly<00:03:46.470> has<00:03:46.800> some

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
that is customizable on the fly has some

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.780 
that is customizable on the fly has some
SmartWatch<00:03:48.330> like<00:03:48.660> apps<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.590> looks<00:03:50.520> really

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
SmartWatch like apps and looks really

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.880 
SmartWatch like apps and looks really
nice<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> very<00:03:51.900> very<00:03:52.080> substantial

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
nice and is a very very substantial

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.970 
nice and is a very very substantial
piece<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.600> jewelry<00:03:54.600> as<00:03:54.810> well<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> functional
