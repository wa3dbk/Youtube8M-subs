 I am looking forward to your performance. A friend on your resume said that he is very adored by Kolleen Park (music) director. Which one is it? 

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:12.966
 It’s me, my father is also an American, my mother is also a Korean and I want to be a musical actor like Kolleen Park (music) director when I grow up. 

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:19.935
 Although it is the opposite of the nationality of my father and mother, it is very good. 

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:27.240
 Good hope that you will often meet Kolleen Park (music) directors in the future. 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.876
 Thank you 

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:30.567
