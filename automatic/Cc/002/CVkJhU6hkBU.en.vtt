00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.260 
gonna be as quiet as the so imagine a
hard<00:00:50.460> drive<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.760> only<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
hard drive it's only gonna have the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.340 
hard drive it's only gonna have the
noise<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.629> hard<00:00:51.780> drive<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.079> though<00:00:52.170> it's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
noise in the hard drive it's though it's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709 
noise in the hard drive it's though it's
got<00:00:52.469> no<00:00:52.620> fans<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> noise<00:00:54.300> from<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> hard

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
got no fans and the noise from the hard

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.970 
got no fans and the noise from the hard
drive<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.960> dampened<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> enclosure

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
drive is dampened by the enclosure

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
drive is dampened by the enclosure
outside<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.360> quiet<00:00:57.570> unique

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
outside so it's a very quiet unique

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.959 
outside so it's a very quiet unique
barely<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:59.730> runs<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.149> USB<00:01:00.780> 2<00:01:01.170> interface

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
barely here it runs on USB 2 interface

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.579 
barely here it runs on USB 2 interface
and<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.329> used<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.840> person<00:01:04.260> who

it's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.900> automatic<00:01:39.900> backup<00:01:40.290> software<00:01:40.549> which

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it's a automatic backup software which

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
it's a automatic backup software which
will<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.420> tell<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.750> folders

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
will you can you tell you which folders

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
will you can you tell you which folders
to<00:01:43.170> backup<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:43.590> help<00:01:43.799> water<00:01:44.340> backup<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
to backup these help water backup to and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.280 
to backup these help water backup to and
then<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.140> routine<00:01:46.560> basis<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.460> will<00:01:48.170> back<00:01:49.170> up

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
then on a routine basis it will back up

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.420 
then on a routine basis it will back up
your<00:01:49.409> folder<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.770> won't<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.399> a

one disadvantages unit is that it isn't
USB<00:02:40.890> powered<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.550> need<00:02:41.820> power<00:02:42.600> supply<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
USB powered you do need power supply and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.460

transformer<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:45.540> run<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.170> kind<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
transformer to to run it so that kind of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.560 
transformer to to run it so that kind of
make<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.550> little<00:02:47.580> less<00:02:47.880> portable<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.480> as

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
make it a little less portable but as

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.300 
make it a little less portable but as
you<00:02:48.660> can<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:48.810> we've<00:02:48.989> got<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> power<00:02:49.380> on<00:02:49.709> the
