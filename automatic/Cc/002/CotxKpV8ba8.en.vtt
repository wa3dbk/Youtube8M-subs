 raising this game mode and good 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.240
 What is this game mode? 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.710
 for those people who do not know it is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.140
 like a dragon is keith but basically 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.609
 we live on an island and we have to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.779
 try to dodge the family area 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.060
 of disease for example is in the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.340
 mother it is the homeland of the fermín 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.719
 fermín father 's great - uncle fermi 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.100

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.530
 I was commenting we have to survive 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.450
 basically because to this game we 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.879
 we found on a map that I think is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 of island but if it is an island and why 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 wisest person you are truly like 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 as we knew it was an island 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.620
 obviously there were a lot of birds not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.050
 used any kind of hacks or something 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.879
 like it's worth I'm totally legal 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.410
 agreement and good as I was commenting 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.000

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.490
 what I have to try is that I do not 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.020
 throw into the water try to get closer to 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.540
 people look for that person there 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.030

 there he is going to go with him there he is 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.409
 dead that person does not want to win the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.420
 game that I will win the game is 4 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.520
 Okay, I have already got your jump 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.770
 I have to try to survive here by 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.210
 Fermin's family favor is not matter 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.170
 take a picture since we were looking 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.040
 simple cool 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.040
 It is done 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.690
 this parable 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.200
 we have truly won not watch as it has 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.010
 got there but that says ya I already 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.060
 I was celebrating 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.530
 not dead dead do not tell me that we were 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.239
 famous never the victory between 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.620
 time and never celebrate victory 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.079
 before time I've seen that guy 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.840
 falling into the water had seen her fall from the 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.610
 water for no one if we are elsewhere 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.840
 We are also birds on the same map. 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 I know how he has done it but he has played 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.200
 baix the same map but good does not happen 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.940
 nothing let's go to the beach part 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.129
 because you already know that I like me 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.810
 little boat to see if you can see boat I think 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.159
 yes, yes it looks good because I say 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.329
 I think if I can and the boat when I already 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.989
 I'm on the boat what's wrong with you 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:55.370
 head and why are you thinking I am 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.370
 the handsome 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.380
 and will sing I am the captain of the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.810
 boat and if it kills me is that I can not 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.400
 have a good third game after 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.010
 that game so happy but nothing happens 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.540
 no i'm not in the mind or i like more 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.780
 this background photo of taking a photo 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.510
 it's very beautiful it 's very beautiful we're in 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 a floating island map 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.480
 It looks like a very map 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.800
 complicated looks like a map 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.420
 that we are going to die functionally 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.860
 pretty fast look where the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.989
 players I can open it for here 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.900
 also that he has hidden because if 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.000
 you are afraid that something will happen to you 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.130
 Do you worry, it looks like a chest 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.810
 totally empty it also seems not to 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.750
 can open in addition to step can not be 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.840
 open and let's go up that 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.840
 they call the bridge part these 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.060
 but if these maps are very complicated 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.650
 They are too complicated because nothing 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.970
 last we left to see if we are able 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.340
 to win this game because it is that the 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.020
 two that we have had have been totally 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.060
 face good this are also islands 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.710
 I do not like floating islands 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.330
 floating because in the end it always ended 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.050
 dead and I do not want to die is already worth 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.520
 beginning of the game we were not going to see 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.230
 I like to try to climb 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.880
 I do not think I think it must be impossible 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.970
 get there bera bera bera bera 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.320
 bera 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.390
 I was aware that I was 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.950
 installed on this side of the house and 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.290
 just just left here there is a great 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.290
 a big blow evades the thing as they are 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.460
 watts to two hearts flipar let's go to 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.800
 get out of here you're going to have another one that's 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.129
 perfect trying to take you away that comes 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.129
 coming 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.060
 all kinds of attempts to recover hearts 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:57.420
 after that that that me and that I 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.860
 had that you have the bow remove us from 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.510
 medium to all 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.530
 they have left me two hearts before I am 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:09.930
 taking a long time to recover life 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:12.480
 obviously not by god said I'm not going to 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.690
 put there because puig disappears is 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.890
 that please read the future my god for 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.890
 please, nobody died 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:28.340
 I'm going to try too much to 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.930
 my wedding there and it will start 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.820
 die of agreement there 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.190
 to begin to die stop there has 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.270
 taken to another side while following the 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.090
 side of this guy who is using 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.030
 the arc 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.160
 can i can win they are dying 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.560

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.160
