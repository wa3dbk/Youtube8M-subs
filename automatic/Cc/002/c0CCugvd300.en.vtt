just<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.880> further<00:02:29.090> protect<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.630> but<00:02:30.140> here<00:02:30.680> it

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
just to further protect it but here it

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.600 
just to further protect it but here it
is<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.540> said<00:02:32.720> before<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.740> rep<00:02:34.370> from

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
is like I said before it is a rep from

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.300 
is like I said before it is a rep from
an<00:02:34.850> Anki<00:02:35.210> wheel<00:02:35.470> which<00:02:36.470> has<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.680> ridiculously

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
an Anki wheel which has a ridiculously

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400 
an Anki wheel which has a ridiculously
long<00:02:37.520> last<00:02:37.790> name<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.300> won't<00:02:38.720> even<00:02:38.840> bother

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
long last name that I won't even bother

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.440 
long last name that I won't even bother
to<00:02:39.830> remember<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.840> series<00:02:42.200> of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
to remember but it's just a series of

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.840 
to remember but it's just a series of
letters<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.750> numbers<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.620> guys<00:02:46.400> can<00:02:46.580> look<00:02:46.700> it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
letters and numbers you guys can look it

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.150 
letters and numbers you guys can look it
up<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.090> want<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.350> you'll<00:02:48.590> be<00:02:48.710> able<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.980> see

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
up you want to and you'll be able to see

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.680 
up you want to and you'll be able to see
exactly<00:02:49.520> how<00:02:49.880> which<00:02:50.150> one<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.360> is

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
exactly how which one it is

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.620 
exactly how which one it is
it's<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.410> design<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.100> has<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.210> thick

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
it's the design that has just a thick

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.320 
it's the design that has just a thick
spoke<00:02:53.990> here<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.440> then<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.830> thins<00:02:55.160> off<00:02:55.370> as<00:02:55.640> it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
spoke here and then just thins off as it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.420 
spoke here and then just thins off as it
goes<00:02:56.480> towards<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.930> barrel<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:58.220> only

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
goes towards the barrel the only

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.430 
goes towards the barrel the only
difference<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.690> thank<00:02:59.990> you<00:03:00.080> wheel<00:03:00.230> is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
difference that and thank you wheel is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.220 
difference that and thank you wheel is
that<00:03:00.560> it's<00:03:00.740> more<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.490> round<00:03:01.870> kind<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.930> finish

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that it's more of a round kind of finish

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.680 
that it's more of a round kind of finish
this<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.370> guess<00:03:04.670> is<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.940> little<00:03:05.060> bit<00:03:05.300> more<00:03:05.420> jagged

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
this I guess is a little bit more jagged

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.290 
this I guess is a little bit more jagged
with<00:03:06.020> with<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.530> finish<00:03:06.830> right<00:03:07.070> here<00:03:07.209> but<00:03:08.209> out

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
with with this finish right here but out

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.150 
with with this finish right here but out
of<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:08.500> here<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.700> chromium<00:03:11.530> XXR<00:03:12.530> 550

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
of that here it is the chromium XXR 550

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.370 
of that here it is the chromium XXR 550
these<00:03:13.880> calm<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.720> couple<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.110> different

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
these calm and a couple of different

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.620 
these calm and a couple of different
sizes<00:03:15.739> this<00:03:16.720> particular<00:03:17.720> set<00:03:18.010> it's<00:03:19.010> 18<00:03:19.400> by

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
sizes this particular set it's 18 by

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.910 
sizes this particular set it's 18 by
8.75<00:03:20.920> with<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> 36<00:03:22.550> offset<00:03:23.500> they<00:03:24.500> also<00:03:24.650> make

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
8.75 with a 36 offset they also make

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.540 
8.75 with a 36 offset they also make
people<00:03:25.700> even<00:03:26.090> 19<00:03:26.780> offset<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.620> it's<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.400> pretty

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
people even 19 offset so it's a pretty

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.040 
people even 19 offset so it's a pretty
low<00:03:28.760> offset<00:03:28.940> it's<00:03:29.209> like<00:03:29.300> 20<00:03:29.660> offset<00:03:29.959> or

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
low offset it's like 20 offset or

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.110 
low offset it's like 20 offset or
something<00:03:30.320> like<00:03:30.380> that<00:03:30.440> then<00:03:31.220> they<00:03:31.730> have<00:03:31.760> those

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
something like that then they have those

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.640 
something like that then they have those
same<00:03:32.360> offsets<00:03:33.020> but<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.160> wider<00:03:34.370> wheel<00:03:34.640> an<00:03:35.650> 818

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
same offsets but in a wider wheel an 818

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.690 
same offsets but in a wider wheel an 818
by<00:03:37.360> 9.75<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.800> guys<00:03:39.980> can<00:03:40.160> definitely<00:03:40.489> look

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
by 9.75 and you guys can definitely look

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.370 
by 9.75 and you guys can definitely look
that<00:03:40.910> up<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:42.040> believe<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.510> I'm<00:03:44.750> wondering<00:03:44.989> or

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
that up I believe and I'm wondering or

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.660 
that up I believe and I'm wondering or
something<00:03:45.650> like<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.800> pretty<00:03:46.370> much<00:03:46.520> has<00:03:46.640> the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
something like that pretty much has the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.790 
something like that pretty much has the
best<00:03:46.940> pictures<00:03:47.209> online<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.530> guys<00:03:48.650> can

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
best pictures online so you guys can

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.400 
best pictures online so you guys can
definitely<00:03:49.130> check<00:03:49.220> those<00:03:49.400> up<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.140> yeah<00:03:51.170> so

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
definitely check those up and yeah so

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.150 
definitely check those up and yeah so
here<00:03:51.770> it<00:03:51.860> is<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.300> other<00:03:53.300> than<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.570> actually

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
here it is and other than that actually

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.610 
here it is and other than that actually
take<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.610> whole<00:03:55.790> thing<00:03:55.820> as<00:03:56.240> a<00:03:56.270> methoxy<00:03:57.170> yes<00:03:57.590> I

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
take the whole thing as a methoxy yes I

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:14.670 
take the whole thing as a methoxy yes I
see<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.980> whole<00:03:58.100> thing

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.920 

alrighty<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:15.800> there<00:04:16.580> it<00:04:16.670> is<00:04:16.700> comes<00:04:17.690> with<00:04:17.840> a

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
alrighty so there it is comes with a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.400 
alrighty so there it is comes with a
nice<00:04:18.110> black<00:04:18.560> finish<00:04:18.769> on<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:20.209> barrel<00:04:20.570> inside

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
nice black finish on the barrel inside

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.450 
nice black finish on the barrel inside
and<00:04:21.620> out<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.680> thing<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.920> like<00:04:25.100> about<00:04:25.130> it<00:04:25.400> is

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
and out and the thing I like about it is

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.610 
and out and the thing I like about it is
the<00:04:25.610> chromium<00:04:25.880> like<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.870> black<00:04:27.230> chrome

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the chromium like the black chrome

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.150 
the chromium like the black chrome
basically<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:29.330> think<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.530> matches<00:04:30.770> well<00:04:31.130> with

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
basically I think it matches well with

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.410 
basically I think it matches well with
the<00:04:31.520> plasma<00:04:31.700> blue<00:04:32.030> pearl<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.570> my<00:04:32.840> car<00:04:33.170> and<00:04:34.420> it's

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
the plasma blue pearl of my car and it's

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.380 
the plasma blue pearl of my car and it's
a<00:04:35.510> pretty<00:04:36.050> nice<00:04:36.230> concrete<00:04:36.860> design<00:04:37.130> if<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.150> turn

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
a pretty nice concrete design if I turn

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.330 
a pretty nice concrete design if I turn
here<00:04:38.660> this<00:04:38.900> way<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.350> little<00:04:39.590> bit<00:04:42.340> obviously

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
here this way a little bit obviously

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.270 
here this way a little bit obviously
this<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:44.140> 2d<00:04:45.140> media<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.890> can't<00:04:46.130> really

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
this is 2d media so you can't really

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.420 
this is 2d media so you can't really
tell<00:04:46.700> the<00:04:46.940> depth<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:48.110> let<00:04:48.740> me<00:04:48.830> turn<00:04:48.980> it<00:04:49.130> this

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
tell the depth but let me turn it this

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.880 
tell the depth but let me turn it this
way<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:50.810> can't<00:04:51.050> really<00:04:51.080> see<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.500> hub<00:04:51.680> too

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
way you can't really see the hub too

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.920 
way you can't really see the hub too
much<00:04:52.070> but<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:52.880> can<00:04:52.940> see<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.570> spokes

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
much but you can see the the spokes
