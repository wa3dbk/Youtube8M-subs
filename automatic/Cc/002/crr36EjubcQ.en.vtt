 How does the motorcycle exchange work? 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.130
 I do not know how it is low 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.340
 bike works for sure then note that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 simply criminal zinho this 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 here is the one that will make the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:30.410
 transition to the transfer of gears 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:33.210

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.500

 This bike will consume money 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 to quote because each march has a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.460
 speed variation 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.820
 What is the gait to be placed on the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.780

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.759
 speed assessment you have to 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.160

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:20.150
