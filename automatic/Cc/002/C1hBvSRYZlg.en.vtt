00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.200
 To this 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 I was able to get the settings of my virtual machine 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.780
 for cleide en and the bridge for iiss which contain the installation files 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.070

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.460
 neither terminal figure 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 a better view 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 and what I can do an installation I did it 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.240

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.939
 to do the installation 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.169

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.609
 to take effect we'll have to restart the server 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.249
 the virtualized server in this case links 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.439
