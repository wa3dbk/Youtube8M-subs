00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.370 

we're<00:00:00.359> going<00:00:00.510> to<00:00:00.599> go<00:00:00.719> back<00:00:00.900> now<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.199> our

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
we're going to go back now to our

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.610 
we're going to go back now to our
hydrogen<00:00:02.370> if<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.419> remember<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.080> hydrogen

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
hydrogen if you remember the hydrogen

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.349 
hydrogen if you remember the hydrogen
didn't<00:00:05.130> really<00:00:05.370> give<00:00:05.520> out<00:00:05.640> very<00:00:05.910> much<00:00:05.970> lights

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
didn't really give out very much lights

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.870 
didn't really give out very much lights
when<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:06.810> when<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.290> tried<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.560> burn<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.130> but

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
when we when we tried to burn that but

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.610 
when we when we tried to burn that but
we<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.300> get<00:00:09.599> some<00:00:09.809> light<00:00:09.960> out<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.469> if

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
we can get some light out to this if

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.259 
we can get some light out to this if
with<00:00:10.769> rather<00:00:10.950> clever<00:00:11.309> by<00:00:11.730> heating<00:00:12.000> up

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
with rather clever by heating up

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.650 
with rather clever by heating up
something<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.049> gives<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:13.530> light<00:00:14.660> so

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
something that gives out some light so

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.930 
something that gives out some light so
this<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.900> what<00:00:16.020> we're<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.350> try<00:00:16.590> now

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
this is what we're going to try now

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.460 
this is what we're going to try now
we've<00:00:17.940> got<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> hydrogen<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.810> oxygen<00:00:19.199> lights

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
we've got the hydrogen and oxygen lights

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.810 
we've got the hydrogen and oxygen lights
here<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> heat<00:00:20.520> up<00:00:20.550> well

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
here and we're going to heat up well

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.240 
here and we're going to heat up well
this<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> stick<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.600> chalk<00:00:22.130> exactly<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
this is a stick of chalk exactly the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.439 
this is a stick of chalk exactly the
same<00:00:23.430> sort<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.760> thing<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.060> your<00:00:24.180> teacher

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
same sort of thing that your teacher

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.420 
same sort of thing that your teacher
would<00:00:24.720> use<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.680> we're<00:00:25.800> heating<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
would use so we're heating it up if you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.349 
would use so we're heating it up if you
have<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.580> lights<00:00:26.789> down<00:00:26.910> please<00:00:29.150> look<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
have the lights down please look at this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.470 
have the lights down please look at this
brilliant<00:00:30.929> white<00:00:31.140> light<00:00:31.669> okay<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
brilliant white light okay so there's a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.270 
brilliant white light okay so there's a
chemical<00:00:33.750> reaction<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.620> well<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
chemical reaction going on well the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
chemical reaction going on well the
chalk<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.530> calcium<00:00:37.530> carbonate<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.489> under<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
chalk is calcium carbonate and under the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.990 
chalk is calcium carbonate and under the
heat<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.440> forming<00:00:41.160> calcium<00:00:41.340> oxide

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
heat here this is forming calcium oxide

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
heat here this is forming calcium oxide
and<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> calcium<00:00:43.379> oxide<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and it's actually the calcium oxide that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.400 
and it's actually the calcium oxide that
is<00:00:44.430> glowing<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> lump<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.020> calcium

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is glowing we have a lump of calcium

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
is glowing we have a lump of calcium
oxide<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> top<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.940> heating

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
oxide on the top here and just heating

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.590 
oxide on the top here and just heating
that<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> same<00:00:49.800> light<00:00:50.070> out

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
that up we can get the same light out

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.970 
that up we can get the same light out
now<00:00:51.600> calcium<00:00:51.870> oxide<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> also<00:00:53.160> called<00:00:53.579> lime

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
now calcium oxide is also called lime

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
now calcium oxide is also called lime
now<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.219> light<00:00:56.579> source<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.210> used<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.660> early

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
now this light source was used in early

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
now this light source was used in early
theaters<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.039> when<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.280> wanted<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> spotlight

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
theaters so when they wanted a spotlight

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.760 
theaters so when they wanted a spotlight
on<00:01:00.300> somebody<00:01:00.719> well<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.260> did<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.590> their

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
on somebody well how did they get their

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.900 
on somebody well how did they get their
bright<00:01:02.010> light<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.579> wasn't<00:01:02.699> any

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
bright light well there wasn't any

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.810 
bright light well there wasn't any
batteries<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.690> light<00:01:04.439> bulbs<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.280> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
batteries and light bulbs at the time so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
batteries and light bulbs at the time so
they<00:01:05.939> used<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.330> chemical<00:01:06.689> light<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
they used this chemical light from the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.850 
they used this chemical light from the
lime<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.369> hence<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:09.750> called<00:01:09.960> lime<00:01:10.290> light

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
lime and hence we was called lime light

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
lime and hence we was called lime light
okay<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.820> still<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.450> expression<00:01:12.810> now

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
okay we still have this expression now

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
okay we still have this expression now
in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.070> lime<00:01:14.280> light<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> how<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> was

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
in the lime light and this is how it was

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.370 
in the lime light and this is how it was
generated<00:01:16.880> well<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.509> exactly<00:01:18.720> did<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.320> do

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
generated well how exactly did they do

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
generated well how exactly did they do
it<00:01:19.650> well<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> sort<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> apparatus

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it well this is the sort of apparatus

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.780 
it well this is the sort of apparatus
that<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.630> used<00:01:22.159> similar<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.310> ours

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that they used similar to ours

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.179 
that they used similar to ours
there's<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.380> taps<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
there's the the taps here with the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.100 
there's the the taps here with the
hydrogen<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> oxygen<00:01:27.119> coming<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.900> we

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
hydrogen and the oxygen coming in we

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.319 
hydrogen and the oxygen coming in we
need<00:01:28.350> hydrogen<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> oxygen<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.090> need

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
need hydrogen and oxygen because we need

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.390 
need hydrogen and oxygen because we need
a<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.229> hot<00:01:31.439> flame<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.979> order<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
a really really hot flame in order to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.880 
a really really hot flame in order to
excite<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> calcium<00:01:34.020> oxide<00:01:34.350> sufficiently

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
excite the calcium oxide sufficiently

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.399 
excite the calcium oxide sufficiently
okay<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> gases<00:01:36.090> come<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.960> then

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
okay so the gases come in here and then

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.840 
okay so the gases come in here and then
come<00:01:37.619> out<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.100> jet<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.670> play

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
come out of the little jet here and play

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.990 
come out of the little jet here and play
on<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.630> calcium<00:01:40.110> oxide<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> lime<00:01:41.189> okay

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
on the calcium oxide or the lime okay

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
on the calcium oxide or the lime okay
how<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.500> hydrogen<00:01:44.009> oxygen

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
how do they get there hydrogen oxygen

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
how do they get there hydrogen oxygen
well<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.360> big<00:01:45.659> balloons<00:01:46.049> big

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
well they just have big balloons big

bladders here filled up with the gasses

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
bladders here filled up with the gasses
and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.079> when<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.500> needed<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.890> turn<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to try and get the gases to come out

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.560 
to try and get the gases to come out
more<00:01:55.170> forcefully<00:01:55.500> onto<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> lime<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.450> there

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
more forcefully onto the lime but there

more forcefully onto the lime but there
is<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.840> course<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> bit<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> problem<00:01:58.619> with

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
is of course a bit of a problem with

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.310 
is of course a bit of a problem with
this<00:01:59.840> okay<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> bags<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.250> hydrogen<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
this okay with the bags of hydrogen and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.050 
this okay with the bags of hydrogen and
that<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.590> course<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.979> hydrogen<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.640> also

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
that is of course that hydrogen is also

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.010 
that is of course that hydrogen is also
flammable

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020
