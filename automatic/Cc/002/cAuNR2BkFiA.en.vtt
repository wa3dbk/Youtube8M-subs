trapped<00:01:25.060> inside<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.749> so<00:01:25.929> that<00:01:26.049> it<00:01:26.139> could

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
trapped inside of it so that it could

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.940

that<00:01:50.740> day<00:01:50.950> when<00:01:50.979> i<00:01:51.189> swatched<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.759> news<00:01:51.909> later

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
that day when i swatched the news later

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.929 
that day when i swatched the news later
in<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.600> city<00:01:52.749> i<00:01:52.869> live<00:01:53.139> in<00:01:53.200> was<00:01:54.039> only<00:01:54.429> 41

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
in the city i live in was only 41

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.269 
in the city i live in was only 41
degrees<00:01:56.520> last<00:01:57.520> time<00:01:57.819> one<00:01:58.240> hour<00:01:58.389> 15<00:01:58.599> minutes

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
degrees last time one hour 15 minutes

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
degrees last time one hour 15 minutes
again<00:02:00.279> everything<00:02:00.609> was<00:02:00.700> pretty<00:02:00.819> hot<00:02:01.090> when<00:02:01.240> I

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
again everything was pretty hot when I

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.399 
again everything was pretty hot when I
went<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.539> get<00:02:01.689> it<00:02:01.719> out<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.079> I<00:02:02.109> had<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.259> be

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
went to get it out so I had to be

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.199 
went to get it out so I had to be
careful<00:02:02.619> but<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.340> recipe<00:02:03.670> had<00:02:03.789> only<00:02:03.909> called

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
careful but the recipe had only called

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.120 
careful but the recipe had only called
for<00:02:04.389> 50<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.899> 55<00:02:05.319> minutes<00:02:05.679> at<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:05.889> temperature

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
for 50 to 55 minutes at that temperature

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.739 
for 50 to 55 minutes at that temperature
but<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.399> had<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.639> run<00:02:06.759> an<00:02:06.909> errand<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.479> ended<00:02:07.659> up

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
but I had to run an errand so I ended up

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.130 
but I had to run an errand so I ended up
being<00:02:07.990> gone<00:02:08.200> longer<00:02:08.680> than<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.850> 50<00:02:10.119> 55<00:02:10.750> minutes

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
being gone longer than the 50 55 minutes

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.240 
being gone longer than the 50 55 minutes
so<00:02:11.260> it's<00:02:11.770> actually<00:02:12.010> an<00:02:12.100> hour<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.520> 15<00:02:13.000> min

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
so it's actually an hour and 15 min

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.520 
so it's actually an hour and 15 min
I<00:02:13.280> was<00:02:13.850> surprised<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.810> stuff<00:02:15.080> didn't

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
I was surprised that the stuff didn't

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.840 
I was surprised that the stuff didn't
actually<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:16.340> didn't<00:02:16.640> burn<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.810> brownies

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850
