00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
already been through the beat warp in on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.240 
already been through the beat warp in on
the<00:01:32.729> last<00:01:32.909> tutorial<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> Ableton<00:01:33.930> 101<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.159> I'm

the last tutorial the Ableton 101 so I'm

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
the last tutorial the Ableton 101 so I'm
going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.400> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.670> fly<00:01:36.000> through<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.570> here

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
going to kind of fly through it on here

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.330 
going to kind of fly through it on here
but<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.560> stuck<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.979> beat<00:01:38.130> warp

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but if you get stuck with a beat warp

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.530 
but if you get stuck with a beat warp
and<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.520> might<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.670> worth<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and it might be worth going back and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.730 
and it might be worth going back and
having<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.439> again

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
having a look at that again

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
give you a little overview of what the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.930 
give you a little overview of what the
controls<00:02:46.190> are<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.610> see<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.850> little

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.760 
controls are as you can see the little
triangles<00:02:47.630> there<00:02:48.020> obviously<00:02:48.350> your<00:02:48.560> play

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
triangles there obviously your play

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.500 
triangles there obviously your play
buttons<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.880> click<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.180> at<00:02:50.360> any

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
buttons so if you click that at any

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.690 
buttons so if you click that at any
point<00:02:50.630> it'll<00:02:51.260> play<00:02:51.740> that<00:02:51.980> track<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.550> that

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
point it'll play that track and that

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.630 
point it'll play that track and that
will<00:02:52.850> be<00:02:52.970> quantized<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.740> grid<00:02:54.980> as<00:02:55.130> well<00:02:55.160> so

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
will be quantized to the grid as well so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.040 
will be quantized to the grid as well so
all<00:02:55.880> your<00:02:56.060> tracks<00:02:56.300> are<00:02:56.390> going<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.570> be<00:02:56.630> lined<00:02:56.870> up

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
all your tracks are going to be lined up

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.390 
all your tracks are going to be lined up
so<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.320> can<00:02:57.470> literally<00:02:57.740> hit<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.070> play<00:02:58.370> button

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
so you can literally hit the play button

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.510 
so you can literally hit the play button
any<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.840> four<00:03:00.140> beats<00:03:00.380> running<00:03:00.710> up<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.400> your

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
any of the four beats running up to your

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.060 
any of the four beats running up to your
next<00:03:01.850> end<00:03:02.090> bar<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.050> then<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.680> tracks<00:03:03.920> going

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
next end bar and then the tracks going

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.530 
next end bar and then the tracks going
to<00:03:04.130> drop<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.460> on<00:03:04.580> time<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.030> be<00:03:05.090> perfectly<00:03:05.480> in

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
to drop in on time and be perfectly in

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.730 
to drop in on time and be perfectly in
sync<00:03:05.630> which<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.080> quite<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> cool<00:03:06.470> feature

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
sync which is quite a cool feature

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.070 
sync which is quite a cool feature
although<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.280> lot<00:03:07.490> of<00:03:07.520> people<00:03:07.610> do<00:03:07.940> kind<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.330> bang

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
that but yeah so to replicate the DJ

that but yeah so to replicate the DJ
setup<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.850> little<00:03:16.880> bit<00:03:17.150> more<00:03:17.360> what<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.720> might

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
setup a little bit more what you might

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.100 
setup a little bit more what you might
want<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.050> do<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.260> stick<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.710> a<00:03:18.920> 3-band<00:03:19.730> EQ<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.020> if

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
want to do is stick in a 3-band EQ so if

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.340 
want to do is stick in a 3-band EQ so if
you<00:03:21.200> go<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.410> your<00:03:21.740> M<00:03:22.450> Audio<00:03:23.450> plugins<00:03:23.870> audio

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
you go to your M Audio plugins audio

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.500 
you go to your M Audio plugins audio
effects<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.070> throw<00:03:25.790> EQ<00:03:26.750> 3<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.380> on<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.740> deck

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
effects and throw EQ 3 in on that deck

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.640 
effects and throw EQ 3 in on that deck
EQ<00:03:29.510> 3<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.900> on<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.140> deck<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.380> then<00:03:30.560> you've

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
EQ 3 and on that deck and then you've

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.050 
EQ 3 and on that deck and then you've
literally<00:03:31.040> got<00:03:31.160> your<00:03:31.370> bass<00:03:31.550> mid<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:31.910> treble

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060

literally got your bass mid and treble
as<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:32.390> would<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.690> normal<00:03:32.780> one<00:03:33.200> anyway<00:03:33.530> and

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
as you would a normal one anyway and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.000 
as you would a normal one anyway and
then<00:03:34.580> another<00:03:35.420> little<00:03:35.570> cool<00:03:35.810> thing<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.380> you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
then another little cool thing is you

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.949 
then another little cool thing is you
can<00:03:37.220> assign<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.790> cross<00:03:38.150> fader<00:03:38.420> at<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.660> bottom

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
can assign a cross fader at the bottom

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:39.970 
can assign a cross fader at the bottom
if<00:03:39.110> that's<00:03:39.320> not<00:03:39.470> showing<00:03:39.650> up<00:03:39.770> on<00:03:39.860> your<00:03:39.890> screen

cross fader there and you can choose
which<00:03:43.730> deck<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.240> assigned<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.720> which<00:03:44.870> side<00:03:45.260> at

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
which deck is assigned to which side at

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.960 
which deck is assigned to which side at
the<00:03:45.680> bottom<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:46.130> you'll<00:03:46.250> say<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.490> want<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.820> to

the bottom so you'll say I want that to
be<00:03:47.060> on<00:03:47.180> side<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.620> would<00:03:48.920> be<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:49.160> side<00:03:49.430> B<00:03:49.730> and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.979 
an overview of the track as well you can
obviously<00:04:01.520> just<00:04:01.880> select<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.630> can<00:04:02.750> see

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
obviously just select it and you can see

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.400 
obviously just select it and you can see
with<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.320> cursor<00:04:03.770> how<00:04:03.920> far<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.310> are<00:04:04.340> through<00:04:04.730> it

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
can go back and then you can fine-tune

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.790 
can go back and then you can fine-tune
if<00:06:09.570> I<00:06:09.630> didn't<00:06:09.870> like<00:06:09.990> that<00:06:10.020> cut<00:06:10.350> there<00:06:10.560> didn't

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
if I didn't like that cut there didn't

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.660 
if I didn't like that cut there didn't
think<00:06:10.950> that<00:06:11.040> was<00:06:11.130> right<00:06:11.280> you<00:06:11.430> can<00:06:11.520> just

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
think that was right you can just

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.540 
think that was right you can just
literally<00:06:11.910> take<00:06:12.330> them<00:06:12.510> points<00:06:12.840> out<00:06:13.020> and<00:06:13.550> it'll

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
literally take them points out and it'll

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.980 
literally take them points out and it'll
no<00:06:14.790> longer<00:06:15.060> be<00:06:15.180> cutting<00:06:15.420> across<00:06:15.660> at<00:06:15.870> that

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
no longer be cutting across at that

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.140 
no longer be cutting across at that
point<00:06:16.260> so<00:06:17.040> yes<00:06:17.250> quite<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.580> nice<00:06:17.730> lot<00:06:17.910> of<00:06:17.970> thing

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
point so yes quite a nice lot of thing

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.210 
point so yes quite a nice lot of thing
it's<00:06:18.930> quite<00:06:19.290> fiddly<00:06:19.530> to<00:06:19.710> do<00:06:19.800> with<00:06:19.920> the<00:06:20.010> mouse

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
it's quite fiddly to do with the mouse

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.580 
it's quite fiddly to do with the mouse
and<00:06:20.640> keyboard<00:06:20.910> but<00:06:21.480> you<00:06:21.960> can<00:06:22.110> get<00:06:22.260> a<00:06:22.290> MIDI

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
and keyboard but you can get a MIDI

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.560 
and keyboard but you can get a MIDI
controller<00:06:23.070> for<00:06:23.490> it<00:06:23.610> there's<00:06:23.820> thousands<00:06:24.450> of

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
controller for it there's thousands of

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.390 
controller for it there's thousands of
them<00:06:24.720> all<00:06:24.870> available<00:06:25.140> now<00:06:25.530> and<00:06:25.740> it's<00:06:26.100> just<00:06:26.250> as

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
them all available now and it's just as

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.910 
them all available now and it's just as
simple<00:06:26.730> as<00:06:26.880> if<00:06:27.150> you<00:06:27.690> click<00:06:27.990> your<00:06:28.380> MIDI<00:06:28.590> button

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
simple as if you click your MIDI button

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.790 
simple as if you click your MIDI button
at<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.130> top<00:06:29.340> here<00:06:30.230> everything<00:06:31.230> becomes<00:06:31.530> MIDI

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
at the top here everything becomes MIDI

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.680 
at the top here everything becomes MIDI
assignable<00:06:32.340> so<00:06:32.880> then<00:06:32.970> if<00:06:33.060> I<00:06:33.150> wanted<00:06:33.390> the<00:06:33.510> cross

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
assignable so then if I wanted the cross

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.260 
assignable so then if I wanted the cross
fader<00:06:33.960> to<00:06:34.800> be<00:06:34.920> assigned<00:06:35.280> by<00:06:35.610> a<00:06:35.850> particular

fader to be assigned by a particular
MIDI<00:06:36.660> controller<00:06:37.110> I'll<00:06:37.380> literally<00:06:37.620> just

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
MIDI controller I'll literally just

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.770 
MIDI controller I'll literally just
click<00:06:38.130> that<00:06:38.370> and<00:06:38.610> then<00:06:39.000> give<00:06:39.120> it<00:06:39.210> a<00:06:39.270> wiggle<00:06:39.450> on

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
click that and then give it a wiggle on

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.630 
click that and then give it a wiggle on
the<00:06:39.870> MIDI<00:06:40.050> controller<00:06:40.500> and<00:06:40.800> then<00:06:41.220> when<00:06:41.550> it

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
the MIDI controller and then when it

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.090 
the MIDI controller and then when it
switches<00:06:41.880> back<00:06:42.210> that<00:06:42.570> MIDI<00:06:42.840> controller<00:06:43.380> will

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
switches back that MIDI controller will

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.100 
switches back that MIDI controller will
then<00:06:44.340> control<00:06:45.210> that<00:06:45.420> and<00:06:45.690> you<00:06:45.780> can<00:06:45.900> literally

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
then control that and you can literally

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.470 
then control that and you can literally
go<00:06:46.290> through<00:06:46.320> assign<00:06:47.070> all<00:06:47.220> your<00:06:47.370> EQ<00:06:47.700> automation

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
go through assign all your EQ automation

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.030 
go through assign all your EQ automation
so<00:06:48.570> you<00:06:48.630> can<00:06:48.750> have<00:06:48.840> a<00:06:48.870> DJ<00:06:49.200> mixer<00:06:49.530> set<00:06:49.710> up<00:06:49.830> there

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
so you can have a DJ mixer set up there

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.800 
so you can have a DJ mixer set up there
and<00:06:50.370> even<00:06:50.610> have<00:06:50.790> hot<00:06:51.030> cues<00:06:51.270> to<00:06:51.480> trigger<00:06:51.720> your

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
and even have hot cues to trigger your

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.330 
and even have hot cues to trigger your
tracks<00:06:52.050> on<00:06:52.230> so<00:06:52.920> it's<00:06:53.040> quite<00:06:53.160> an<00:06:53.310> interesting

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
tracks on so it's quite an interesting

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.920 
tracks on so it's quite an interesting
way<00:06:53.850> of<00:06:53.880> working

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
way of working

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.330 
way of working
I<00:06:54.960> actually<00:06:55.230> don't<00:06:55.620> work<00:06:55.800> like<00:06:56.010> this<00:06:56.160> with

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
I actually don't work like this with

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.160 
I actually don't work like this with
Ableton<00:06:56.730> Live<00:06:56.880> I<00:06:57.060> think<00:06:57.240> it's<00:06:57.360> a<00:06:57.510> little<00:06:58.020> bit

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
Ableton Live I think it's a little bit

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.540 
Ableton Live I think it's a little bit
boring<00:06:58.380> it's<00:06:58.680> not<00:06:58.800> really<00:06:59.010> bringing<00:06:59.340> anything

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
boring it's not really bringing anything

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.370 
boring it's not really bringing anything
new<00:06:59.670> to<00:07:00.030> the<00:07:00.120> party<00:07:00.300> so<00:07:01.020> I'm<00:07:01.080> going<00:07:01.200> to<00:07:01.260> show

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
new to the party so I'm going to show

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.470 
new to the party so I'm going to show
you<00:07:01.410> some<00:07:01.740> more<00:07:02.070> complex<00:07:02.550> tutorials<00:07:03.210> later

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
you some more complex tutorials later

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.760 
you some more complex tutorials later
but<00:07:03.810> I<00:07:03.840> think<00:07:03.990> this<00:07:04.050> is<00:07:04.170> definitely<00:07:04.350> a<00:07:04.620> good

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
but I think this is definitely a good

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.710 
but I think this is definitely a good
way<00:07:04.920> to<00:07:04.980> get<00:07:05.190> into<00:07:05.370> DJ<00:07:05.760> mixing<00:07:06.090> using<00:07:06.240> Ableton

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
way to get into DJ mixing using Ableton

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.040 
way to get into DJ mixing using Ableton
Live<00:07:06.870> so<00:07:07.110> I<00:07:07.140> hope<00:07:07.290> you<00:07:07.410> enjoyed<00:07:07.830> that
