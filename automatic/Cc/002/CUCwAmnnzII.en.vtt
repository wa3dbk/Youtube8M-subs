only<00:01:34.350> thing<00:01:34.500> i'd<00:01:34.650> say<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.340> looks

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
only thing i'd say this kind of looks

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
only thing i'd say this kind of looks
weird<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> his<00:01:36.479> head<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.079> with

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
weird is the back of his head like with

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
weird is the back of his head like with
his<00:01:37.380> hair<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:39.000> doesn't

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
his hair as you can see it just doesn't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.630 
his hair as you can see it just doesn't
look<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.630> hundred<00:01:40.049> percent<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
look a hundred percent right but it's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280 
look a hundred percent right but it's
not<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.790> big<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.299> deal<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> know

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
not that big of a deal it just you know

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
not that big of a deal it just you know
doesn't<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.130> hundred<00:01:44.490> percent<00:01:44.579> replicate

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
doesn't a hundred percent replicate

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
doesn't a hundred percent replicate
Baird's<00:01:46.049> hair<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.740> well<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.729> no<00:01:47.939> big

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
Baird's hair but well then that's no big

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.789 
Baird's hair but well then that's no big
deal<00:01:48.270> he<00:01:48.450> looks<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.990> looks<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> lot<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.530> baird

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
deal he looks it looks a lot like baird

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.330 
deal he looks it looks a lot like baird
you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> tell<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.430> him<00:01:51.680> armor<00:01:52.680> wise<00:01:52.860> it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you can tell to him armor wise it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.450 
you can tell to him armor wise it's
really<00:01:53.640> nice<00:01:54.049> he's<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.770> looks<00:01:56.159> exactly

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
really nice he's you know looks exactly

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.120 
really nice he's you know looks exactly
like<00:01:56.700> him<00:01:57.110> articulation<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.560> same<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.950> any

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
like him articulation is the same as any

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
like him articulation is the same as any
of<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> other<00:01:59.369> gears<00:01:59.640> three<00:01:59.820> figures<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
of the other gears three figures the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.789 
of the other gears three figures the
only<00:02:00.840> thing<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.590> but

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
only thing that I don't really like but

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.679 
only thing that I don't really like but
the<00:02:01.920> equation<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.329> easy<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the equation is it's not really easy to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
the equation is it's not really easy to
get<00:02:03.930> him<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> hold<00:02:04.469> his<00:02:04.590> Lancer<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.040> both

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
get him to hold his Lancer with both

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.779 
get him to hold his Lancer with both
hands<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:07.079> know<00:02:07.200> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> much<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> clay

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
hands you know kind of much like a clay

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.180 
hands you know kind of much like a clay
carmine<00:02:09.270> withholding<00:02:09.810> his<00:02:09.840> regular<00:02:10.770> Lancer

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
carmine withholding his regular Lancer

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
carmine withholding his regular Lancer
he<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.970> he

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
he just he

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.840 
he just he
you<00:02:12.840> can't<00:02:13.110> really<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.310> can't<00:02:14.520> hold<00:02:14.670> it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
you can't really you just can't hold it

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.080 
you can't really you just can't hold it
so<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.840> mean<00:02:16.020> bear<00:02:16.320> can<00:02:16.590> hold<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.790> most

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
so I mean bear can hold it for the most

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.190 
so I mean bear can hold it for the most
part<00:02:18.710> but<00:02:19.710> not<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.790> way<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:22.020> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
part but not the way that you like I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.630 
part but not the way that you like I
mean<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.950> hold<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.520> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
mean you can see you can hold it but it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.230 
mean you can see you can hold it but it
just<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.970> doesn't<00:02:24.230> that's<00:02:25.230> not<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:26.240> right

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
just it doesn't that's not really right

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.750 
just it doesn't that's not really right
there<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:29.250> kind<00:02:29.460> of<00:02:29.490> get<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
there but you know you kind of get the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.200 
there but you know you kind of get the
main<00:02:30.480> gist<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.070> but<00:02:32.070> um<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.580> can't<00:02:32.820> hold<00:02:33.090> it

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
main gist of it but um he can't hold it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.940 
main gist of it but um he can't hold it
just<00:02:33.480> not<00:02:33.660> he<00:02:34.170> can't<00:02:34.380> lay<00:02:34.470> down<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.740> iron

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
just not he can't lay down the iron

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.190 
just not he can't lay down the iron
sights<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.460> whatnot<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.510> not<00:02:36.690> too<00:02:36.810> big<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.080> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
sights and whatnot it's not too big of a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.630 
sights and whatnot it's not too big of a
deal<00:02:37.350> with<00:02:37.530> me<00:02:37.710> because<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.580> do

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
deal with me because it's not like I do

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.040 
deal with me because it's not like I do
these<00:02:38.910> four<00:02:39.120> stop<00:02:39.300> motions<00:02:39.660> or<00:02:39.720> anything<00:02:39.990> I

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050

cool articulation it's the same as like

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.380 
cool articulation it's the same as like
carmine<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.530> whatnot<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.240> very<00:02:54.240> good

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
carmine and whatnot so very good

carmine and whatnot so very good
articulation<00:02:54.690> detail<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.890> fantastic

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
articulation detail on it is fantastic

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.940 
articulation detail on it is fantastic
he<00:02:57.660> has<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.810> peg<00:02:58.080> hole<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.350> back<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.890> you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
he has the peg hole in the back so you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.160 
he has the peg hole in the back so you
can<00:02:59.130> put<00:02:59.430> peg<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> retro<00:03:00.720> Lancer<00:03:00.990> on<00:03:01.050> his

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
cool is my first retro answer I'm not

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.510 
cool is my first retro answer I'm not
really<00:03:06.300> sure<00:03:06.420> why<00:03:07.050> there's<00:03:07.350> black<00:03:07.710> on<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
really sure why there's black on the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.060 
really sure why there's black on the
blade<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.200> understand<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.380> red<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:10.920> of

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
blade and understand the red because of

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.070 
blade and understand the red because of
the<00:03:11.160> blood<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.760> some<00:03:12.480> reason<00:03:12.720> those<00:03:12.840> black

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the blood but some reason those black

enough<00:05:30.680> how<00:05:31.120> how<00:05:32.120> well<00:05:32.420> nekkid<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.170> throws

detail<00:05:34.520> on<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.940> these<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.120> think<00:05:35.210> it's<00:05:35.480> just

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
detail on to these I think it's just

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.630 
detail on to these I think it's just
really<00:05:35.990> really<00:05:36.800> good<00:05:38.920> so<00:05:39.920> you<00:05:40.010> can<00:05:40.130> also<00:05:40.280> as<00:05:40.520> I

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
really really good so you can also as I

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.730 
really really good so you can also as I
said<00:05:40.670> take<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.150> onto<00:05:41.360> his<00:05:41.570> back<00:05:41.840> which<00:05:42.440> works

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
said take it onto his back which works

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.530 
said take it onto his back which works
but<00:05:43.490> it's<00:05:43.610> just<00:05:43.760> kind<00:05:43.910> of<00:05:43.940> weird<00:05:44.000> because<00:05:44.360> it

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
but it's just kind of weird because it

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.760 
but it's just kind of weird because it
is<00:05:44.660> like<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:45.020> said<00:05:45.200> how<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.380> has<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.590> rubber

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
is like I said how it has the rubber

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.530 
is like I said how it has the rubber
backing<00:05:46.040> stuff<00:05:46.400> so<00:05:46.610> it<00:05:46.760> kind<00:05:46.940> of<00:05:47.000> wobbles

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
backing stuff so it kind of wobbles

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.390 
backing stuff so it kind of wobbles
around<00:05:47.810> all<00:05:48.200> over<00:05:48.230> the<00:05:48.560> place<00:05:48.680> even<00:05:48.890> if<00:05:49.310> you

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
around all over the place even if you

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.400 
around all over the place even if you
prevent<00:05:49.700> all<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.030> way<00:05:50.150> it<00:05:50.300> just<00:05:50.410> wobbles

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
prevent all the way it just wobbles

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.800 
prevent all the way it just wobbles
around<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:52.280> it<00:05:52.460> just<00:05:52.700> it's<00:05:52.880> kind<00:05:53.000> of<00:05:53.210> weird<00:05:53.480> so

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
around and it just it's kind of weird so

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.380 
around and it just it's kind of weird so
have<00:05:54.380> that<00:05:54.590> in<00:05:54.710> mind<00:05:54.950> that<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.790> pegs<00:05:56.090> I<00:05:56.240> mean

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
have that in mind that the pegs I mean

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.010 
have that in mind that the pegs I mean
they<00:05:56.510> work<00:05:56.780> but<00:05:57.050> it's<00:05:57.170> just<00:05:57.500> it's<00:05:57.680> just<00:05:57.830> weird

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
they work but it's just it's just weird

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
they work but it's just it's just weird
doesn't<00:06:00.020> seem<00:06:00.110> like<00:06:00.260> it's<00:06:00.560> you<00:06:00.890> know<00:06:00.920> a

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
doesn't seem like it's you know a

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.400 
doesn't seem like it's you know a
hundred<00:06:01.340> percent<00:06:01.600> you<00:06:02.600> know<00:06:02.630> meant<00:06:03.020> to<00:06:03.170> stay

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
hundred percent you know meant to stay

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.790 
hundred percent you know meant to stay
completely<00:06:04.100> steady<00:06:05.050> which<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.320> know<00:06:06.410> it's<00:06:06.710> no

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
completely steady which you know it's no

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.340 
completely steady which you know it's no
big<00:06:06.950> deal<00:06:06.980> but<00:06:07.880> just<00:06:08.540> throwing<00:06:09.200> that<00:06:09.230> out

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
figures their articulation is just

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.660

tremendous<00:06:29.980> except<00:06:30.980> the<00:06:31.070> only<00:06:31.250> complaint<00:06:31.520> as

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
tremendous except the only complaint as

tremendous except the only complaint as
i<00:06:31.760> have<00:06:31.910> is<00:06:32.090> it<00:06:32.270> you<00:06:32.720> know<00:06:32.840> they<00:06:33.020> try<00:06:33.200> to<00:06:33.260> make

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
i have is it you know they try to make

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.590 
i have is it you know they try to make
this<00:06:33.650> a<00:06:33.890> really<00:06:34.370> really<00:06:34.670> effective<00:06:35.360> joint

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
this a really really effective joint

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600 
this a really really effective joint
which<00:06:35.870> i<00:06:36.020> mean<00:06:36.110> it<00:06:36.230> is<00:06:36.350> in<00:06:36.380> some<00:06:36.860> ways<00:06:37.070> but<00:06:37.400> I

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
which i mean it is in some ways but I

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.200 
which i mean it is in some ways but I
mean

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
mean

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.760 
mean
good<00:06:38.419> and<00:06:38.569> hiding<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.080> articulation<00:06:39.740> and

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
good and hiding the articulation and

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.290 
good and hiding the articulation and
whatnot<00:06:40.130> but<00:06:40.310> it's<00:06:40.490> not<00:06:40.669> good<00:06:40.880> for<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:41.060> fact

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
whatnot but it's not good for the fact

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.059 
whatnot but it's not good for the fact
that<00:06:41.360> he<00:06:41.479> can't<00:06:41.720> really<00:06:42.020> perfectly<00:06:42.620> hold<00:06:42.919> his

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
that he can't really perfectly hold his

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.129 
that he can't really perfectly hold his
weapons<00:06:43.430> went<00:06:44.240> on<00:06:44.389> like<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.720> gears<00:06:44.930> of<00:06:45.020> war

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
weapons went on like the gears of war

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.710 
weapons went on like the gears of war
two<00:06:45.169> figures<00:06:45.650> actually<00:06:46.360> did<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.419> better<00:06:47.599> job

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
two figures actually did a better job

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.990 
two figures actually did a better job
holding<00:06:48.620> weapons<00:06:48.830> than<00:06:49.310> now<00:06:49.460> the<00:06:49.520> gears<00:06:49.759> three

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
holding weapons than now the gears three

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.300 
holding weapons than now the gears three
ones<00:06:50.180> are<00:06:50.330> but<00:06:51.139> um<00:06:51.289> you<00:06:51.740> know<00:06:51.830> it's<00:06:52.069> not<00:06:52.130> too

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
ones are but um you know it's not too
