00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.420 

okay<00:00:03.840> so<00:00:03.899> we're<00:00:04.200> doing<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.589> leak<00:00:04.799> down<00:00:05.069> test

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
okay so we're doing a leak down test

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.640 
okay so we're doing a leak down test
here<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:06.319> 2007<00:00:07.319> CRF<00:00:08.130> 250r<00:00:09.290> this<00:00:10.290> happens<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
here on a 2007 CRF 250r this happens to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.100 
here on a 2007 CRF 250r this happens to
be<00:00:10.769> actually<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> homemade<00:00:11.580> leak<00:00:11.910> tester<00:00:12.389> it's

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
be actually a homemade leak tester it's

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.310 
be actually a homemade leak tester it's
built<00:00:13.320> out<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.710> Milton<00:00:14.160> regulator<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.940> a

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
built out of a Milton regulator with a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.380 
built out of a Milton regulator with a
zero<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.440> 160<00:00:17.400> psi<00:00:18.350> liquid<00:00:19.350> field<00:00:19.560> gauge<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:20.070> it

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
zero to 160 psi liquid field gauge on it

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.240 
zero to 160 psi liquid field gauge on it
I<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> make<00:00:21.900> an<00:00:21.990> orifice<00:00:22.260> though<00:00:22.650> for<00:00:23.160> this

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
I had to make an orifice though for this

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.710 
I had to make an orifice though for this
to<00:00:23.519> work<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:24.180> there<00:00:24.330> has<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to work because there has to be a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.300 
to work because there has to be a
differential<00:00:25.199> pressure<00:00:25.410> pressure

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
differential pressure pressure

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.490 
differential pressure pressure
differential<00:00:27.000> story<00:00:27.210> between<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.869> input<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
differential story between the input and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.659 
differential story between the input and
the<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> output<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> regulator<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the the output of the regulator so that

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.760 
the the output of the regulator so that
you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:33.059> measure<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.930> skin<00:00:34.230> what's<00:00:34.530> going

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
you can measure what skin what's going

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740 
you can measure what skin what's going
on<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> engine<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.540> far

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
on with the with the engine here as far

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.310 
on with the with the engine here as far
as<00:00:36.870> leakage<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.480> just<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.780> give<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.200> idea

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
as leakage so just to give you an idea

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
as leakage so just to give you an idea
here<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> did<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.579> machined<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> block

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
here what I did was I machined a block

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.510 
here what I did was I machined a block
brass<00:00:43.170> plug<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.040> drilled<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
brass plug and I drilled it with a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.209 
brass plug and I drilled it with a
number<00:00:44.730> 65<00:00:45.270> drill<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:45.870> I've<00:00:46.050> got

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
number 65 drill bit which I've got

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.910 
number 65 drill bit which I've got
sticking<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.670> orifice<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
sticking in the little orifice there and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
sticking in the little orifice there and
so<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.070> does<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.820> reduces<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so what that does is it reduces the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.840 
so what that does is it reduces the
amount<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.079> volume<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.860> able<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> go

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
amount of volume that's able to go

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.110 
amount of volume that's able to go
through<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.239> quick<00:00:54.510> coupler<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
through this quick coupler here into the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.389 
through this quick coupler here into the
into<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> regulator<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.559> happens<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> if

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
into the regulator so what happens is if

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
into the regulator so what happens is if
there's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> loss<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.270> pressure<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:01.020> it'll

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
there's a loss of pressure here it'll

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
there's a loss of pressure here it'll
really<00:01:01.680> show<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.699> won't<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.149> able

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
really show because this won't be able

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
really show because this won't be able
to<00:01:03.359> keep<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.110> volume<00:01:04.260> needed<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
to keep up with the volume needed to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.149 
to keep up with the volume needed to
supply<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.299> constant<00:01:07.170> supply<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.799> air<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
supply a constant supply of air so

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.870 
supply a constant supply of air so
differential<00:01:11.159> pressure<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
differential pressure that's the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.310 
differential pressure that's the
important<00:01:12.240> thing<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:12.810> I've<00:01:12.930> done<00:01:13.080> here

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
important thing so what I've done here

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
important thing so what I've done here
is<00:01:13.380> I've<00:01:14.070> taken<00:01:14.100> off<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:14.939> cap<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.240> on

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
is I've taken off the little cap here on

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.730 
is I've taken off the little cap here on
the<00:01:15.869> clutch<00:01:16.170> case<00:01:16.560> side<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> engine<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
the clutch case side of the engine and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.969 
the clutch case side of the engine and
I've<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> number<00:01:20.430> eight<00:01:20.580> hex<00:01:21.770> plugged<00:01:22.770> into

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I've got a number eight hex plugged into

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.420 
I've got a number eight hex plugged into
the<00:01:24.170> into<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> socket<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.280> just

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the into the socket in there I'm just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.770 
the into the socket in there I'm just
gonna<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.270> drill<00:01:27.420> bit<00:01:27.600> down

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
gonna put this little drill bit down

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.060 
gonna put this little drill bit down
here<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.350> using<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:30.650> using<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.829> breaker

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
here and I'm using a I'm using a breaker

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
here and I'm using a I'm using a breaker
bar<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> put<00:01:34.020> pressure

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
bar because when we go to put pressure

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.760 
bar because when we go to put pressure
on<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.950> piston<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> cylinder

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
on this piston in here in the cylinder

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
on this piston in here in the cylinder
there's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> lot<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.159> pressure<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.140> we'll

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
there's a lot of pressure there so we'll

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
there's a lot of pressure there so we'll
be<00:01:40.259> applying<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.710> hundred<00:01:41.009> psi<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
be applying a hundred psi to this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.560 
be applying a hundred psi to this
cylinder<00:01:43.759> okay<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.820> I've<00:01:45.060> already<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
cylinder okay so I've already got the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
cylinder okay so I've already got the
pressure<00:01:45.750> regulator<00:01:46.140> set<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:46.979> basically

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
pressure regulator set up but basically

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
pressure regulator set up but basically
this<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.540> video<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.290> blurry

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this this video is a little bit blurry

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160 
this this video is a little bit blurry
I'll<00:01:49.649> post<00:01:49.890> some<00:01:50.040> pictures<00:01:50.630> how<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.840> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I'll post some pictures how I know this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.289 
I'll post some pictures how I know this
is<00:01:52.320> working<00:01:52.680> correctly<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:53.970> with

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
is working correctly is because with

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.130 
is working correctly is because with
zero<00:01:54.689> input<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:57.030> needle<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
zero input I get the needle is on the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
zero input I get the needle is on the
bottom<00:01:58.740> peg<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.360> okay<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.810> gonna

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
bottom peg here okay so I'm just gonna

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.270 
bottom peg here okay so I'm just gonna
pause<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.740> second<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
pause for a second here and

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.460 
pause for a second here and
plug<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.030> air<00:02:04.180> supply<00:02:06.330> okay<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.319> we've

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
plug in the air supply okay so we've

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.280 
plug in the air supply okay so we've
plugged<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.830> air<00:02:08.950> supply<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.550> here<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.300> I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
plugged the air supply in here and I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.410 
plugged the air supply in here and I
know<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:13.290> differential<00:02:14.290> pressure<00:02:15.420> or

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
know that the differential pressure or

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.150 
know that the differential pressure or
the<00:02:16.600> orifice<00:02:17.050> here<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.350> restricting<00:02:17.890> things

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the orifice here is restricting things

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.710 
the orifice here is restricting things
such<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.459> we<00:02:18.819> can<00:02:19.000> read<00:02:19.180> differential

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
such that we can read differential

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.150 
such that we can read differential
pressure<00:02:19.930> we're<00:02:20.170> losing<00:02:20.470> everything<00:02:20.739> through

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
pressure we're losing everything through

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.650 
pressure we're losing everything through
the<00:02:21.310> engine<00:02:21.670> through<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.910> intake<00:02:22.300> here<00:02:22.540> I've

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the engine through the intake here I've

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.140 
the engine through the intake here I've
got<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.840> set<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.580> bottom<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> intake

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
got it set to bottom of the intake

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.110 
got it set to bottom of the intake
stroke<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.520> blowing<00:02:27.880> straight

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
stroke and it's all blowing straight

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.970 
stroke and it's all blowing straight
through<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.630> carburetor<00:02:29.200> through<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
through the carburetor through the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.240 
through the carburetor through the
intake<00:02:30.760> valve<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:32.590> know<00:02:32.709> we<00:02:32.860> got<00:02:32.890> full

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
intake valve so we know we got full

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.520 
intake valve so we know we got full
differential<00:02:33.819> pressure<00:02:34.030> here<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.569> that's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
differential pressure here and that's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.440 
differential pressure here and that's
that<00:02:35.950> tells<00:02:36.160> me<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.640> gauge<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.060> working

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
that tells me that this gauge is working

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.960 
that tells me that this gauge is working
properly<00:02:37.950> okay<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.010> now<00:02:39.280> what<00:02:39.430> we're<00:02:39.610> gonna<00:02:39.700> do

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
properly okay so now what we're gonna do

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.880 
properly okay so now what we're gonna do
is<00:02:40.030> we're<00:02:40.209> gonna<00:02:40.269> go<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.750> start<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.260> move<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
is we're gonna go and start to move the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.600 
is we're gonna go and start to move the
piston<00:02:42.190> up<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.760> talk<00:02:42.940> dead<00:02:43.180> center<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:44.610> we're

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
piston up to talk dead center and we're

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.970 
piston up to talk dead center and we're
gonna<00:02:45.700> listen<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> here<00:02:46.360> see<00:02:46.989> what<00:02:47.230> see<00:02:47.950> what

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
gonna listen to here see what see what

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.390 
gonna listen to here see what see what
we<00:02:48.250> hear<00:02:48.430> here<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.650> we're<00:02:50.800> gonna<00:02:50.890> watch<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
we hear here and we're gonna watch the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.100 
we hear here and we're gonna watch the
gauge<00:02:51.610> at<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.940> same<00:02:52.150> time<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:52.959> we're

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
gauge at the same time here so we're

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.520 
gauge at the same time here so we're
gonna<00:02:53.230> see<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.560> pressure<00:02:53.800> go<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:54.989> as<00:02:55.989> we<00:02:56.290> seal

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
gonna see the pressure go up as we seal

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
gonna see the pressure go up as we seal
off<00:02:56.739> those<00:02:57.010> valves<00:02:58.680> intake<00:02:59.680> valve<00:02:59.920> seal<00:03:02.550> there

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
off those valves intake valve seal there

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.640 
off those valves intake valve seal there
we<00:03:03.670> are<00:03:05.010> top<00:03:06.010> dead<00:03:06.220> center<00:03:07.200> intake<00:03:08.200> valves<00:03:08.530> are

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
we are top dead center intake valves are

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.340 
we are top dead center intake valves are
sealed<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.480> hear<00:03:10.480> nothing<00:03:10.630> out<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.079> exhaust

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
sealed I hear nothing out the exhaust

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.900 
sealed I hear nothing out the exhaust
but<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.680> do<00:03:11.799> hear<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.280> bubbling<00:03:12.610> from<00:03:12.820> the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
but I do hear some bubbling from the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.610 
but I do hear some bubbling from the
crankcase<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> successful<00:03:17.470> leak

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
crankcase so this is a successful leak

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.940 
crankcase so this is a successful leak
test<00:03:17.920> where<00:03:18.160> we're<00:03:18.790> at<00:03:18.850> 98<00:03:19.329> psi<00:03:19.900> out<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.230> 100<00:03:20.769> so

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
test where we're at 98 psi out of 100 so

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.530 
test where we're at 98 psi out of 100 so
what's<00:03:21.130> happening<00:03:21.549> here<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.090> we've<00:03:22.299> got

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
what's happening here is is we've got

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.380 
what's happening here is is we've got
the<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:24.220> exhaust<00:03:24.519> valves<00:03:24.880> are<00:03:25.000> sealing

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
the the exhaust valves are sealing

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.960 
the the exhaust valves are sealing
perfectly<00:03:26.350> intake<00:03:27.310> valves<00:03:27.610> are<00:03:27.730> sealed

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
perfectly intake valves are sealed

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.539 
perfectly intake valves are sealed
perfectly<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.780> we're<00:03:29.049> losing<00:03:29.170> about<00:03:29.500> two<00:03:29.920> psi

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
perfectly and we're losing about two psi

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.949 
perfectly and we're losing about two psi
through<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.299> pasta<00:03:32.200> rings<00:03:32.640> which<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.959> that's

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
through the pasta rings which is that's

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.849 
through the pasta rings which is that's
very<00:03:35.260> good<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.359> engine<00:03:37.570> rebuild<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.380> a

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
very good so this engine rebuild is a

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.740 
very good so this engine rebuild is a
success<00:03:39.459> we've<00:03:39.910> done<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.180> break-in<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.660> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
success we've done the break-in on the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.000 
success we've done the break-in on the
engine<00:03:41.019> here<00:03:41.200> I'm<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.410> doing<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.680> little<00:03:41.799> test

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
engine here I'm just doing a little test

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.110 
engine here I'm just doing a little test
here<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.280> want<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.519> make<00:03:42.640> sure<00:03:42.670> everything's

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
here I want to make sure everything's

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.140 
here I want to make sure everything's
good<00:03:43.329> before<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.690> let<00:03:43.840> go<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.760> anyway

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
good before I let go and so anyway

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.199 
good before I let go and so anyway
that's<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.720> good<00:03:46.900> leak<00:03:47.079> down<00:03:47.290> test<00:03:47.590> right<00:03:47.829> there

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
that's a good leak down test right there

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.780 
that's a good leak down test right there
see<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.239> again<00:03:49.480> next<00:03:49.690> time
