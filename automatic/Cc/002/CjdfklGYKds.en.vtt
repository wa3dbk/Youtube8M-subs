much<00:00:25.859> hanging<00:00:26.279> from<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> tail<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
much hanging from the tail so that it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.189 
much hanging from the tail so that it
doesn't<00:00:29.070> come<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.369> when<00:00:29.609> you're<00:00:29.730> pulling

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.420 
doesn't come out when you're pulling
your<00:00:31.199> needle<00:00:31.439> through<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> fabric<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.279> then

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
your needle through the fabric and then

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.080 
your needle through the fabric and then
the<00:00:32.610> other<00:00:32.790> end<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.210> want<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> tie<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> knot<00:00:33.899> so

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
the other end you want to tie a knot so

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.950 
the other end you want to tie a knot so
I'm<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
I'm going to show you how to do that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.920 
I'm going to show you how to do that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
because I like to tie it more than once

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.389 
because I like to tie it more than once
because<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.559> kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> small<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because that's kind of small and it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.010 
because that's kind of small and it
might<00:00:41.550> pull<00:00:41.820> through<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> felt<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.780> pull

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
might pull through the felt if you pull

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
might pull through the felt if you pull
too<00:00:43.170> hard<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.969> move

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
too hard so you want to do is just move

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.389 
too hard so you want to do is just move

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
tight see how there's a loop you stick

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.240 
tight see how there's a loop you stick
your<00:01:56.049> needle<00:01:56.170> through<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.560> loop<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.190> then

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
your needle through the loop and then

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.999 
your needle through the loop and then
you<00:01:58.240> pull<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.450> if<00:01:59.289> you<00:01:59.380> do<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.500> one<00:01:59.799> more<00:01:59.979> time

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
you pull it if you do that one more time

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.320 
you pull it if you do that one more time
if<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.310> want<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.520> really<00:02:00.700> tighten<00:02:00.940> on<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:03.330> like

that<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.640> cut<00:02:06.909> your<00:02:07.119> thread<00:02:07.180> and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
that and then you cut your thread and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.420 
that and then you cut your thread and
you<00:02:10.600> have<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:10.989> eye<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.590> then<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.980> place<00:02:12.190> the

you have one eye and then you place the
other<00:02:12.519> one<00:02:12.819> where<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.120> will<00:02:13.239> look<00:02:13.390> good<00:02:13.600> and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
other one where it will look good and

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.459 
other one where it will look good and
you<00:02:14.080> go<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.590> continue<00:02:14.709> with<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.160> second
