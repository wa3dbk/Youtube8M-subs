00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
steering column in it what happened was

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.980 
steering column in it what happened was
the<00:00:09.690> start<00:00:10.440> switch<00:00:11.510> broke<00:00:12.510> off<00:00:12.720> there's<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the start switch broke off there's a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.600 
the start switch broke off there's a
piece<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.290> plastic<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.860> runs<00:00:14.040> down<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.400> top

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
piece of plastic that runs down the top

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.239 
piece of plastic that runs down the top
of<00:00:14.760> the<00:00:14.820> column<00:00:15.439> right<00:00:16.439> here<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.919> it<00:00:17.070> broke

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:17.249 
of the column right here and it broke

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.189 
of the column right here and it broke
off<00:00:17.489> and<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> lock<00:00:18.329> cylinder<00:00:18.659> was<00:00:18.810> turning

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
off and so the lock cylinder was turning

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.739 
off and so the lock cylinder was turning
absolutely<00:00:19.679> nothing<00:00:20.269> of<00:00:21.269> course<00:00:21.509> the<00:00:21.599> biggest

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:21.749 
absolutely nothing of course the biggest

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.769 
absolutely nothing of course the biggest
concern<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.319> these<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.829> these<00:00:23.480> leveling<00:00:24.480> Ford

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
concern on these is these leveling Ford

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.309 
concern on these is these leveling Ford
transponder<00:00:25.529> keys<00:00:26.720> this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> found

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:28.319 
transponder keys this is what I found

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.479 
transponder keys this is what I found
through<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> little<00:00:28.739> of<00:00:28.800> trial<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.130> error<00:00:29.279> so

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
through a little of trial and error so

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.339 
through a little of trial and error so
far<00:00:29.819> of<00:00:30.419> course<00:00:30.599> already<00:00:30.749> have<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> call<00:00:31.199> them

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
far of course already have to call them

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.010 
far of course already have to call them
out<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.559> the<00:00:31.619> car<00:00:32.570> specifically<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.840> lighting

can do this by turning the ignition to
the<00:00:40.980> run<00:00:41.160> position<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.910> then<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the run position and then there is a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.320 
the run position and then there is a
push<00:00:43.710> pin<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.670> get<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.150> through

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
push pin and you can get to it through

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.660 
push pin and you can get to it through
through<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.990> bottom<00:00:46.260> cover<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:47.160> goes<00:00:47.310> up<00:00:47.520> in

through the bottom cover that goes up in

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.460 
through the bottom cover that goes up in
here<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.150> I<00:00:48.540> reached<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.290> real

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
right here this ring is the receiver for

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.979 
right here this ring is the receiver for
the<00:01:00.930> key<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.060> it<00:01:03.060> was<00:01:03.150> just<00:01:03.360> on<00:01:03.480> two<00:01:03.660> column

here behind the lock cylinder and then

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.989 
here behind the lock cylinder and then
of<00:01:07.020> course<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.950> ran<00:01:08.159> down<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:08.429> this<00:01:08.670> little

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:08.999 
of course it ran down to this little

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:11.539 
of course it ran down to this little
