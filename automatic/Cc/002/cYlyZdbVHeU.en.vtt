00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
actually getting to them in a second

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.410 
actually getting to them in a second
here<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.369> basically<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.970> rules<00:00:30.269> were

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
here but basically these rules were

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
here but basically these rules were
implemented<00:00:30.960> by<00:00:31.109> michel<00:00:31.439> gondry<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
implemented by michel gondry and all of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.770 
implemented by michel gondry and all of
such<00:00:32.489> hammer<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.300> reason<00:00:33.510> why<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.719> were

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
such hammer and the reason why they were

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.270 
such hammer and the reason why they were
implemented<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> reverse

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
implemented is because of reverse

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.889 
implemented is because of reverse
booster<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.120> i'm<00:00:36.180> sure<00:00:36.239> live<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> guys<00:00:36.719> know

booster so i'm sure live you guys know

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
booster so i'm sure live you guys know
who<00:00:37.020> reversed<00:00:37.380> boosters<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.430> people<00:00:38.879> who

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
who reversed boosters are the people who

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.569 
who reversed boosters are the people who

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and I think that's so stupid like the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.970 
and I think that's so stupid like the
whole<00:02:12.810> point<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.080> playing<00:02:13.170> video<00:02:13.500> games<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.890> to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.590 
do whatever the fuck you want and I have
to<00:02:16.710> abide<00:02:16.980> by<00:02:17.160> rules<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.850> now<00:02:18.030> we're<00:02:18.570> just

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
to abide by rules but now we're just

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.630

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400 
setting these rules and stuff and it's
it's<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.390> dumb<00:02:21.630> they<00:02:21.660> really<00:02:22.080> need<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> take

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
it's so dumb they really need to take

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.840 
it's so dumb they really need to take
this<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.800> or<00:02:23.130> they<00:02:23.370> need<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.520> figure<00:02:23.700> out

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
this out or they need to figure out

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.150 
this out or they need to figure out
something<00:02:24.450> else<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:25.380> get<00:02:25.470> reverse<00:02:25.800> boosters

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
something else to get reverse boosters

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.680 
something else to get reverse boosters
out<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.460> game<00:02:26.670> maybe<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.330> guys<00:02:27.480> should

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
out of this game maybe you guys should

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.110 
out of this game maybe you guys should
just<00:02:27.810> take<00:02:28.050> out<00:02:28.200> skill<00:02:28.500> based<00:02:28.680> matchmaking

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
just take out skill based matchmaking

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.490 
just take out skill based matchmaking
because<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.510> skill<00:02:31.140> based<00:02:31.290> matchmaking

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
because I think skill based matchmaking

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500 
because I think skill based matchmaking
is<00:02:32.100> annoying<00:02:32.550> as<00:02:32.700> hell<00:02:32.910> when<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.180> comes<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
is annoying as hell when it comes to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.820 
is annoying as hell when it comes to
connections<00:02:33.990> because<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.500> shitty

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
connections because I have shitty

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.230 
connections because I have shitty
connections<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> time<00:02:35.880> when<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.090> play

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
connections all the time when I play

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.210 
connections all the time when I play
this<00:02:36.390> game<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.380> just<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.740> never<00:02:37.830> get<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
this game and I just can never get on a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.440 
this game and I just can never get on a
good<00:02:38.460> hose<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.240> guys<00:02:39.390> should

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
good hose so I think you guys should

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.410 
good hose so I think you guys should
actually<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.680> put<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.550> connection<00:02:42.240> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
actually like put this on connection and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.690 
actually like put this on connection and
not<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.780> skill<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.890> personally<00:02:44.550> don't

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
not on skill because I personally don't

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
this because I think it's a really

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.909 
this because I think it's a really
stupid<00:04:21.030> rule<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.510> implemented<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.169> I

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
stupid rule that implemented and I
