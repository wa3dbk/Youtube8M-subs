00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.620 
then I'm going to add a little water now
you<00:01:20.979> do<00:01:21.310> not<00:01:21.520> want<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:22.000> cover<00:01:22.270> these<00:01:22.600> with

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
you do not want to cover these with

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.870 
you do not want to cover these with
water<00:01:23.110> as<00:01:23.439> if<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.770> were<00:01:23.920> boiling<00:01:24.369> them<00:01:24.549> on<00:01:24.729> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
water as if you were boiling them on the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.719 
water as if you were boiling them on the
stove<00:01:25.180> just<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:26.380> little<00:01:26.799> bit<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.070> water<00:01:27.340> just

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
stove just a little bit of water just

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.520 
stove just a little bit of water just
enough<00:01:28.119> for<00:01:28.540> it<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:28.689> they<00:01:28.840> have<00:01:29.020> something<00:01:29.290> to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
enough for it so they have something to

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.080 
enough for it so they have something to
absorb<00:01:30.040> because<00:01:30.250> they're<00:01:30.520> going<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.700> cook<00:01:30.939> a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
absorb because they're going to cook a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.170 
absorb because they're going to cook a
little<00:01:31.270> bit<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.810> microwave<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.310> I'm<00:01:33.790> going

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
little bit in the microwave so I'm going

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.969 
little bit in the microwave so I'm going
to<00:01:34.360> add<00:01:36.869> two<00:01:37.869> tablespoons<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> runner

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
to add two tablespoons of the runner

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.170 
to add two tablespoons of the runner
that's<00:01:39.460> all<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.790> want

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
obviously the more potatoes you have the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.819 
obviously the more potatoes you have the
more<00:01:42.700> water<00:01:42.909> you<00:01:43.180> want<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.659> add<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.170> what<00:01:44.710> I'm

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
more water you want to add and what I'm

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.039 
more water you want to add and what I'm
going<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.009> do<00:01:45.189> is<00:01:45.670> put<00:01:46.600> these<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
going to do is put these in the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.690 
going to do is put these in the
microwave<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.860> let<00:01:48.100> them<00:01:48.189> cook<00:01:48.490> until

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
microwave and let them cook until

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.780 
microwave and let them cook until
they're<00:01:49.180> about<00:01:49.740> maybe<00:01:50.740> two-thirds<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
they're about maybe two-thirds of the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.700 
they're about maybe two-thirds of the
way<00:01:51.939> done<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.780> really<00:01:53.140> doesn't<00:01:53.500> take<00:01:53.680> very

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
way done it really doesn't take very

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.139 
way done it really doesn't take very
long<00:01:54.040> we<00:01:54.520> don't<00:01:54.670> want<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.880> cook<00:01:55.030> them

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
long we don't want to cook them

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.630 
long we don't want to cook them
completely<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.229> microwave<00:01:56.740> or<00:01:57.130> make<00:01:57.340> mush

it's<00:02:22.230> going<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.440> take<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.160> gives<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
it's going to take but that gives you a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.200 
it's going to take but that gives you a
frame<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.120> reference<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:25.460> have<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> nonstick

skillet here that I have warmed up and
now<00:02:31.500> we're<00:02:31.740> going<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.920> finish<00:02:32.160> cooking<00:02:32.550> our

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
now we're going to finish cooking our

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.510 
now we're going to finish cooking our
dish<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.320> I'm<00:02:34.560> going<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.770> add<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.490> little

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
dish and I'm going to add just a little

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.420 
dish and I'm going to add just a little
bit<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.060> olive<00:02:36.240> oil<00:02:36.600> really<00:02:37.500> not<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> whole<00:02:38.190> lot

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
bit of olive oil really not a whole lot

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.880 
bit of olive oil really not a whole lot
that's<00:02:38.880> probably<00:02:39.600> roughly<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> tablespoon

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
that's probably roughly a tablespoon

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.870 
that's probably roughly a tablespoon
right<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.920> I'm<00:02:44.220> gonna<00:02:44.580> add

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
right there and to that I'm gonna add

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.650 
right there and to that I'm gonna add

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
onion and I'm gonna go ahead and spoon

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.730 
onion and I'm gonna go ahead and spoon
in<00:02:55.470> my<00:02:55.950> potatoes<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.840> way<00:02:58.020> they<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.470> Brown

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
in my potatoes that way they can Brown

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:13.730 
in my potatoes that way they can Brown
up<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.459> finish<00:03:00.090> cooking<00:03:00.330> in<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.959> skillet

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.770 

then<00:03:14.740> you<00:03:15.070> can<00:03:15.280> season<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.000> your<00:03:16.540> way

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
then you can season this your way

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.620 
then you can season this your way
whatever<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.740> want<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> do<00:03:18.250> with<00:03:18.490> it<00:03:18.630> now

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
whatever you want to do with it now

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.540 
whatever you want to do with it now
would<00:03:19.900> be<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.050> time<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.380> start<00:03:20.620> seasoning<00:03:21.400> it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
would be the time to start seasoning it

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.000 
would be the time to start seasoning it
up<00:03:21.700> my<00:03:22.060> stove<00:03:22.420> on<00:03:22.690> number<00:03:23.080> six<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.830> just

a little over medium probably do it just

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.530 
a little over medium probably do it just
a<00:03:26.230> little<00:03:26.350> higher<00:03:26.650> than<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.100> I'm<00:03:27.910> gonna<00:03:28.270> keep
