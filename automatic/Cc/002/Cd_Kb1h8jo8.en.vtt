00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:36.359 
beautiful the quarter ounce learn a
snake

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.990 

yeah<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:37.329> really<00:01:37.509> good<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.789> Perth

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
yeah it's really good from the Perth

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.529 
yeah it's really good from the Perth
Mint<00:01:42.780> 2013<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:45.700> quite<00:01:45.969> happy<00:01:46.090> with<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.390> I

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
Mint 2013 I'm quite happy with that I

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.950 
Mint 2013 I'm quite happy with that I
think<00:01:47.170> that's<00:01:47.289> quite<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.500> good<00:01:47.710> size<00:01:48.960> decided

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
think that's quite a good size decided

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
think that's quite a good size decided
to<00:01:50.049> go<00:01:50.140> ahead<00:01:50.409> and<00:01:50.590> start<00:01:50.829> quarter<00:01:51.189> ounce

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to go ahead and start quarter ounce

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.789 
to go ahead and start quarter ounce
because<00:01:52.420> just<00:01:52.959> one<00:01:53.140> ounce<00:01:53.289> is<00:01:53.500> just<00:01:53.679> too

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
because just one ounce is just too

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.249 
because just one ounce is just too
expensive<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.610> all<00:01:55.329> these<00:01:55.450> patients<00:01:56.020> by<00:01:56.200> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
expensive and all these patients by the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.380 
expensive and all these patients by the
time<00:01:56.439> it<00:01:57.069> takes<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.520> save<00:01:57.700> money<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:58.119> buy<00:01:58.270> an

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
time it takes to save money to buy an

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.109 
time it takes to save money to buy an
ounce<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:58.869> I'm<00:01:59.530> thinking<00:01:59.859> if<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.520> stick<00:02:00.939> to<00:02:00.969> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
ounce so I'm thinking if I stick to the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.490 
ounce so I'm thinking if I stick to the
quarter<00:02:01.740> I'll<00:02:02.740> be<00:02:02.859> able<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.130> buy<00:02:03.310> more<00:02:04.060> often

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
quarter I'll be able to buy more often

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.100 
quarter I'll be able to buy more often
which<00:02:05.500> will<00:02:05.679> keep<00:02:06.569> keep<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.659> stacking

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
which will keep keep the stacking

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.430 
which will keep keep the stacking
happening<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.539> bit<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.810> close<00:02:11.019> up<00:02:11.049> there
