white base so it's not going to be super

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.789 
white base so it's not going to be super
bright<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.180> anything<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.770> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
bright or anything and this one I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
bright or anything and this one I
believe<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> actually<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.000> their<00:01:33.270> permanent

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
believe is actually in their permanent

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.210 
believe is actually in their permanent
line<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.290> still<00:01:34.680> find<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.100> but

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.750 
actually have that shimmer and it's not
really<00:02:48.560> visible<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.040> nails<00:02:49.280> unless<00:02:49.580> you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
really visible on the nails unless you

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.340 
really visible on the nails unless you
look<00:02:49.910> really<00:02:50.209> close<00:02:50.570> because<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.959> really

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
look really close because it's really

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.920 
look really close because it's really
really<00:02:51.590> finely<00:02:52.010> milled<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.690> there's<00:02:53.690> not

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
really finely milled and there's not

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.540 
really finely milled and there's not
that<00:02:53.959> much<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.530> there<00:02:54.800> so<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.220> see<00:02:55.430> it

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
that much in there so you can see it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.310 
that much in there so you can see it
when<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.820> light<00:02:56.030> catches<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.630> bottle<00:02:56.990> but<00:02:57.200> on

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
when the light catches the bottle but on

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.050 
when the light catches the bottle but on
your<00:02:57.470> yellow<00:02:57.620> she<00:02:57.740> can't<00:02:58.010> really<00:02:58.220> tell<00:02:58.459> but

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
your yellow she can't really tell but

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.880 
your yellow she can't really tell but
this<00:02:59.240> is<00:02:59.420> definitely<00:02:59.630> like<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.170> medium<00:03:00.650> in

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
this is definitely like a medium in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.010 
this is definitely like a medium in
screen<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.459> not<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.670> super<00:03:02.180> light<00:03:02.570> one<00:03:02.840> that

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
screen it's not a super light one that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.750 
screen it's not a super light one that
has<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> lot<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.410> white<00:03:03.740> base<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.550> one

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
has a lot of white base in it this one

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.120 
has a lot of white base in it this one
is<00:03:04.880> definitely<00:03:05.030> like<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> medium<00:03:05.959> one<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.410> I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
is definitely like a medium one and I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.770 
is definitely like a medium one and I
would<00:03:07.280> say<00:03:07.490> that<00:03:07.790> it's<00:03:07.940> pretty<00:03:08.209> neutral<00:03:08.420> it's

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
would say that it's pretty neutral it's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.300 
would say that it's pretty neutral it's
a<00:03:08.840> little<00:03:09.110> bit<00:03:09.260> more<00:03:09.530> on<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.680> yellow<00:03:09.950> side

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
a little bit more on the yellow side

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.430 
a little bit more on the yellow side
than<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.880> on<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.420> blue<00:03:11.630> side<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.320> it's

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
than it is on the blue side so it's

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.740 
than it is on the blue side so it's
definitely<00:03:12.800> like<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> true<00:03:13.430> mint<00:03:13.700> color<00:03:13.940> then

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750
