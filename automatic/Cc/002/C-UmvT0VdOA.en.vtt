00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.040
 I am speaking of areas we are here in the 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.639
 paktika stand we will not present what 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.320
 which is our line of ovens and mills 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 for a small demonstration so that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.740
 can see all the benefits that this 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.720
 kind you can enjoy in your 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.609
 establishments what we 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.429
 We commented to present in our 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.470
 line accepted is a gastronomic line 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.480
 since what we have is a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.859
 solution that we call maxi link 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.529
 what does this mean that we 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.570
 we can have two teams stacked and the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.030
 that will benefit us in that we 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.989
 we are going to have in our kitchens a 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.210
 little space for him to start having 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.250
 rods two tombs so big we 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.170
 we can have this solution in a 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.320
 column what will help us is that 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.059
 the spaces are much smaller we are 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.100
 here our team where we are going to 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.019
 work with the steam and on the equipment 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.239
 above we will work with what is a 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.670
 crime here what we too 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.370
 we are going to offer is the solution we 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.379
 having two teams will be very complicated 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.630
 hook and manipulate the panel 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.270
 down then we with a Spanish soil 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.250
 we can manipulate team number one and 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.100
 here it tells us that we are going to use what 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.630
 which is a grill and the number 2 team that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.640
 is the one below where we're going to do 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.750
 saviors option this is so that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.460
 we can have a 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.800
 be much greater in very little space 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.540
 let's command what is our 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.170
 team number 2 because we're going to start 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 with the options something 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.850
 let's put what is the egg 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.890
 we here have bunny 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.570
 we have a saturated steam that right now 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.450
 we are going to talk about a computation of how 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.760
 we produce the steam we have what 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.570
 what is the egg 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.470
 let's place broccoli let's place 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 the shrimp 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.270
 and here we have a team ready 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.340
 of three trays let's talk about it and here 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.750
 we are going to command by means of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.570
 our touch panel number one us 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.550
 23 so let's put it we 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 simplify 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.530
 at the level number one we 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.450
 we propose propose we are going to only 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.460
 place select and we will put the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.460
 time that we require seven 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:25.140
 minute level number two we have the 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.380
 egg that we are going to place 15 minutes 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.170
 and level number 3 we already have the shrimp 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.819
 we are going to place you 5 minutes 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.550
 what is the advantage that we have 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.220
 as we produce steam one has a 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.319
 Patented system called drip 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.270
 what does this mean we have 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.820
 a turbine that works three thousand 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.340
 revolutions per minute draw what is 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.380
 a drop of turbine water what will 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.440
 do is atomize and it's like us 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.209
 we cause that saturated steam in how much 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.290
 we provoke it in 20 seconds 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.239
 we have saturated steam 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.459
 I think we have here that we are going to be able to 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.379
 cooking three products 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.450
 different control what we 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.730
 we are demonstrating is the efficiency that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.099
 we have to be able to cook three products 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.349
 at the same time and we can enter 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.150
 another type of production we do not have to 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.880
 be monitoring that that's time 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.040
 lost at the end of the day 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.540
 and by number 1 what we are going to cook 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.160
 so that you realize that 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.350
 we can be doing cooking 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.870
 completely different let's cook 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.890
 a little salmon and some pumpkins that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.020
 we have here 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.690
 here we have our grill 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.370
 essential kitchen is called iris and we're going to 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.410
 see how it is very easy to place them 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.120
 we open the door always with 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.770
 Be careful not to leave us 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.880
 directly what is the heat 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.250
 let's put what is albos 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.970
 and we are going to place what is our 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.700
 zucchini tray in this case we have 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.010
 a team of 5 levels level 3 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.150
 We are placing the end and its level 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.390
 number 5 what is the salmon let's see 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.380
 how easy it is 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.060
 the level number 3 we have the zucchinis 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:14.140
 level number 3 we will place you 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.819
 seven minutes and level number 5 I have what 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.850
 which is the salmon which we are going to 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.130
 place 5 minutes 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.410
 in that team it's just what I'm 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.080
 doing is working with steam and I'm 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.270
 working what is a simulation of 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.980
 April which is the advantage here 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.460
 he is telling us that the 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.010
 equipment has a temperature of 260 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.290
 degrees that means the furnace or 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.260
 the kitchen often ends up being 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.840
 very hot 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.600
 we can touch the sides and 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.850
 the crystal of what is ours and is a 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.550
 very acceptable temperature I think that 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.680
 we have we have a 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.780
 double crystal and this crystal has a 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.510
 movie what it does is that the heat is 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.520
 the center of the cooking chamber that is 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.340
 what causes us to have a 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.410
 energy saving or make you mix 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.750
 radiating what is the heat towards the 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.240
 outside we really have it 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.010
 in the cooking chamber I want us to 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.130
 is indicating here on my computer is 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.890
 visible and auditory because because many 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.560
 there is a lot of noise in the kitchen 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.320
 then it has a led that is 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.070
 indicating that it is ready and in the case 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.020
 we also have it 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.449
 something very important that we have 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.749
 here with technology 1 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.219
 is that we have a schedule 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:36.289
 determined we have what is 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.539
 the steam the grill to make it very easy 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.999
 identify the process that we are going to 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.819
 use we can have it with the 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.979
 multiple times and we also have a 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.729
 standardization us if it does not come 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:53.089
 determined a recipe that is not for 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.909
 me or decided a barbecue we can not 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.740
 schedule what that recipe is for 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.710
 standardize them and we go to the 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.229
 library where we have 99 reservations 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.779
 to schedule and we can search our 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.569
 recipe to make it very easy to use 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:11.029
 have without the wash cycles we have 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:14.150
 what is a rinse we have what is 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.580
 a savings a short one medium and long 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.490
 which depends 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.509
 that we are going to have to when 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.509
 we were using
