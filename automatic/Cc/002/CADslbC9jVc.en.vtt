obviously<00:00:04.020> with<00:00:04.170> two<00:00:04.200> new<00:00:04.500> writers<00:00:04.910> James<00:00:05.910> has

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
obviously with two new writers James has

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.970 
obviously with two new writers James has
been<00:00:06.150> aware<00:00:06.359> for<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> season<00:00:07.049> our<00:00:07.290> two<00:00:07.500> seasons

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
been aware for a season our two seasons

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.839 
been aware for a season our two seasons
and<00:00:08.840> no<00:00:09.840> simply<00:00:10.230> first<00:00:10.800> target<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.400> both<00:00:11.730> in

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and no simply first target is to both in

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.030 
and no simply first target is to both in
the<00:00:11.910> showdown<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.450> think<00:00:12.630> Jim's<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:13.080> easily<00:00:13.920> do

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the showdown I think Jim's can easily do

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.359 
the showdown I think Jim's can easily do
that<00:00:15.199> expectations<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.289> Jim<00:00:16.500> quite<00:00:17.010> simple

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
that expectations for Jim quite simple

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.349 
that expectations for Jim quite simple
for<00:00:17.490> me<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.820> know<00:00:17.880> we've<00:00:18.060> got<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> be

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
for me is you know we've got to be

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.970 
for me is you know we've got to be
challenging<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> championship<00:00:19.529> get<00:00:19.890> in

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
challenging for the championship get in

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.519 
challenging for the championship get in
the<00:00:20.070> showdown<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:20.760> part<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.420> then

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
the showdown first part of that and then

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.960 
the showdown first part of that and then
being<00:00:22.529> contention<00:00:23.220> become<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> last<00:00:23.670> couple

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
being contention become the last couple

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.609 
being contention become the last couple
rounds<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.289> very

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
rounds and I think that's very

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.359 
rounds and I think that's very
achievable<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.550> within<00:00:26.670> his<00:00:26.930> target<00:00:28.369> Joshua

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
achievable and within his target Joshua

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.400 
achievable and within his target Joshua
waters<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> slightly<00:00:30.000> different<00:00:30.269> we've<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.869> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
waters is slightly different we've got a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
waters is slightly different we've got a
different<00:00:31.920> plan<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.130> Josh<00:00:32.460> obviously<00:00:32.910> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
different plan for Josh obviously you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.430 
different plan for Josh obviously you
know<00:00:33.239> he<00:00:33.329> needs<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.600> learn<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> circuit<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
know he needs to learn the circuit so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500 
know he needs to learn the circuit so
get<00:00:34.559> his<00:00:34.649> way<00:00:34.829> around<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.239> circus<00:00:36.239> he's<00:00:36.360> never

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
get his way around the circus he's never

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that will be a challenge for him to do

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
that will be a challenge for him to do
that<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:56.370> come<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:57.500> Australia<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.969> way

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
point was you know we we've got a good

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.399 
point was you know we we've got a good
look<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.080> him<00:01:22.250> at<00:01:23.250> Zilker<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.060> tower<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.720> I've

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
look at him at Zilker a tower and I've

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.760 
look at him at Zilker a tower and I've
been<00:01:25.740> watching<00:01:26.070> him<00:01:26.159> test<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.729> afor<00:01:27.150> Suzuki

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
in the off season and I felt it would be

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
in the off season and I felt it would be
a<00:01:31.290> good<00:01:31.560> acquisition<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> team<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
a good acquisition for the team and I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
a good acquisition for the team and I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
like the guy he's got a good good

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
like the guy he's got a good good

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
personality fits well with the sponsor
profile<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.369> let's<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.700> wait<00:01:38.820> to

after<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.709> next<00:03:13.920> test<00:03:14.010> its<00:03:14.340> net<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:14.790> there

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
after the next test its net and if there

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.340 
after the next test its net and if there
is<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> possibility<00:03:15.480> then<00:03:15.810> we'll<00:03:15.930> certainly<00:03:16.079> do

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
is a possibility then we'll certainly do

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.870 
is a possibility then we'll certainly do
that<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.950> minute<00:03:17.190> we've<00:03:17.310> just<00:03:17.670> got<00:03:17.790> the

three days test him to things test the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.340 
three days test him to things test the
rider<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.390> bike<00:03:21.570> that's<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.989> first<00:03:22.170> and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
rider on the bike that's the first and

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.800 
rider on the bike that's the first and
foremost

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810
