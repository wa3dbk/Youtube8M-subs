Christian love so I thought I'd give it
a<00:02:08.350> try<00:02:08.619> myself<00:02:09.209> also<00:02:10.209> note<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.079> heart<00:02:11.290> of

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
a try myself also note that the heart of

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.740 
a try myself also note that the heart of
the<00:02:11.560> game<00:02:11.769> lies<00:02:12.010> with<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.280> combo<00:02:12.790> meter<00:02:13.000> shoot

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the game lies with the combo meter shoot

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.020 
the game lies with the combo meter shoot
an<00:02:13.900> enemy<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.620> multiplier<00:02:15.220> starts<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.820> go

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
an enemy and the multiplier starts to go

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.120 
an enemy and the multiplier starts to go
up<00:02:16.060> keep<00:02:16.810> shooting<00:02:16.989> enemies<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.680> make<00:02:17.829> it<00:02:18.010> go

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
up keep shooting enemies to make it go

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.770 
up keep shooting enemies to make it go
higher<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.670> if<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.150> don't<00:02:19.329> shoot<00:02:19.570> any

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
higher and if you don't shoot any

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.660 
higher and if you don't shoot any
enemies<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.560> while<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:21.190> will<00:02:21.400> disappear

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
enemies for a while it will disappear

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.559 
enemies for a while it will disappear
there<00:02:22.600> are<00:02:22.720> 20<00:02:23.079> levels<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.620> multiplier<00:02:24.220> in

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.940 

right<00:02:28.569> that's<00:02:28.959> enough<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.379> Hammerhead

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
right that's enough of the Hammerhead

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.130 
right that's enough of the Hammerhead
because<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.879> also<00:02:31.030> set<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> plane<00:02:31.780> parts

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
because you can also set the plane parts

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.170 
because you can also set the plane parts
to<00:02:32.319> random<00:02:32.769> which<00:02:33.099> means<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.459> each<00:02:33.700> time<00:02:33.730> you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
to random which means that each time you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.179 
to random which means that each time you
launch<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.870> plane<00:02:35.110> that's<00:02:35.349> constructed<00:02:36.069> is

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
launch the plane that's constructed is

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.240 
launch the plane that's constructed is
different<00:02:36.700> here's<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.269> few<00:02:37.480> examples<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:39.040> is

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
different here's a few examples this is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.580 
different here's a few examples this is
the<00:02:39.489> storm<00:02:39.909> rouser<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.569> has<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> laser<00:02:41.319> beam

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
the storm rouser it has a laser beam

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.250 
the storm rouser it has a laser beam
weapon<00:02:42.010> standard<00:02:42.700> engine<00:02:42.879> I<00:02:43.239> think<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:43.840> a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
weapon standard engine I think and a

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.680 
weapon standard engine I think and a
body<00:02:44.590> type<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.129> automatically<00:02:45.879> drops<00:02:46.360> bombs

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
body type that automatically drops bombs

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.910 
body type that automatically drops bombs
as<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.140> shoot<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:49.510> biohazard<00:02:49.870> mark<00:02:50.379> 2<00:02:50.650> has

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
as you shoot the biohazard mark 2 has

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.979 
as you shoot the biohazard mark 2 has
the<00:02:51.159> biggest<00:02:51.400> slowest<00:02:52.180> weapon<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.659> the<00:02:52.780> game

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
the biggest slowest weapon in the game

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.289 
the biggest slowest weapon in the game
it<00:02:53.290> has<00:02:53.650> an<00:02:53.829> antigravity<00:02:54.189> engine<00:02:55.120> which

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
it has an antigravity engine which

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.270 
it has an antigravity engine which
floats<00:02:55.689> if<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.959> let<00:02:56.140> go<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.680> thrust<00:02:57.069> and

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
floats if you let go of the thrust and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.580 
floats if you let go of the thrust and
the<00:02:57.640> body<00:02:57.879> is<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.120> nuclear<00:02:58.659> bomb<00:02:58.989> which<00:02:59.290> goes

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
the body is a nuclear bomb which goes

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.860 
the body is a nuclear bomb which goes
off<00:02:59.799> when<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.159> die<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.760> kills<00:03:01.060> everything<00:03:01.480> on
