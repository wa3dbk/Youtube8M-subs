this can't be hold on
that's<00:00:53.190> computer<00:00:53.909> code<00:00:55.040> let<00:00:56.040> me<00:00:56.159> compile<00:00:56.610> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that's computer code let me compile it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.719 
that's computer code let me compile it
oh<00:00:57.979> shit<00:00:58.979> it's<00:00:59.189> an<00:00:59.280> encrypted<00:00:59.670> file<00:01:01.610> upload<00:01:02.610> it

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
oh shit it's an encrypted file upload it

oh shit it's an encrypted file upload it
to<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:02.909> computer<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:03.510> mastered<00:01:04.140> decryption<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
to my computer I mastered decryption I

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
to my computer I mastered decryption I
can't<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:08.009> only<00:01:08.280> compatible<00:01:08.759> with<00:01:09.000> the
