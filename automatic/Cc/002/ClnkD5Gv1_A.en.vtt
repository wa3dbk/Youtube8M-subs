00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello girls then welcome to this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.069
 new channel called that I make 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.090
 up review and meanwhile, thanks for having me 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.429
 followed so far 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.290
 this is my first video can a video 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 to explain that project to you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.710
 which I will do a little like he did once 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.170
 four years ago now for one of the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 palaces and I tell you what I will do in the future in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.510
 this channel 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.760
 or what speaks to me in this 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.330
 channel pavel review of products 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 cosmetics including the two minutes then 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.369
 complete but brief serious that go to the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.260
 point that they explain why I like it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.610
 because I don't like a product there 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.040
 I show I show both the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 produced both the richness of the product and 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 and conservative father this way 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.469
 I will be able to talk really can do more 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.149
 videos because they will be videos anyway 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.829
 they will take me less time but not for 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.850
 I think this is less interesting because 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.719
 one of the questions I get most asked 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.570
 how to this product like this 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.760
 produced naturally by doing video only 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 that is to say, I diminish on mine 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.280
 main channel are video tutorials 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.220
 I don't have time to talk about the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.390
 produced in this way instead I will take 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.740
 your requests 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.119
 I will see what they are what i am 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.979
 products of which he wanted to hear 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.680
 and you can review them 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.920
 products will be the renunciation view 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.409
 normal or ravioli with ragÃ¹ will be there 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.750
 reviews naturally based on mine 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.500
 experience on my test produced by 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.150
 when i arrived in america 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.579
 I really had the chance to 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.250
 find many many many products 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.979
 so i think i'm pretty good 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 and compare them or wherever it's something that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 I've always liked to see more 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.430
 product try it good home garments are 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.110
 a good thing that is different 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.329
 innovative compared to other products 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.970
 so I don't know I think the mind that 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.939
 may be a nice project and that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.290
 can help so many of you in the choice 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.420
 own cosmetics naturally 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.330
 personal opinions you will not always be 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.060
 agree with me it is normal there are 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.800
 people who maybe you love a product 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.390
 maybe you don't hate another maybe you have 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.750
 only found those you haven't tried one 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.140
 you can't compare another 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.820
 two or more products is my desire 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.070
 the desire to do this, however, the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.080
 second from the fact that however having many 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.400
 products I can compare them for a moment 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.230
 between them then maybe a product 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.900
 that looks good maybe compared in 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.270
 another curtain already evident a little less 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.310
 good of course done that will be 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.290
 honest reviews I almost took for granted 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.750
 but I always care to say it will be 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.660
 always having always honest I will never be 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.580
 paid or in fact tomorrow the washing of 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.160
 brain to say something I don't think 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.950
 of course the products I will choose in 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.330
 based on this I think I am interesting 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.459
 based on what you ask for 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.290
 because naturally I will read yours 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.660
 comments and I will take inspiration from yours 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.700
 breda from what you need to know if 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.320
 good if it's not good I'll try to talk 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.280
 of the most recent things 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.410
 prehistoric and diets or videos I will try 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.780
 to do it in the same way or with a 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.610
 heathrow where I show the product 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.860
 I tell you how much the product costs 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.350
 speak a little the product I show 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.239
 as the product then applied and do a 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.720
 final vote therefore more or less all lives 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:21.080
 they will be similar and there will be videos 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.710
 where if a product I really go 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.110
 also says miur with type here 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.510
 the gold medal because it is a product 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.190
 fantastic and instead if a product 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.560
 giving up will win the stamp in mine 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.230
 shame type name the stamp of 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.110
 shame 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.260
 I hope you like this idea and see 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.100
 a moment will happen from now on then 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.100
 a bit like salami
