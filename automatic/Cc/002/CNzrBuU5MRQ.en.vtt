is<00:00:57.809> two<00:00:58.109> important<00:00:58.739> things<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.160> need<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is two important things that we need to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
is two important things that we need to
be<00:00:59.609> technically<00:01:00.059> aware<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
be technically aware of first of all is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
be technically aware of first of all is
this<00:01:01.890> gold<00:01:02.190> foiling<00:01:02.609> depending<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.539> what

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
this gold foiling depending on what

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.479 
this gold foiling depending on what
lighting<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.350> use<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:04.890> diffusion<00:01:05.400> we

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
lighting we use and what diffusion we

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
lighting we use and what diffusion we
use<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.479> either<00:01:06.570> look<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.140> good<00:01:07.380> or

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
use this can either look really good or

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.740 
use this can either look really good or
not<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.189> good<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.850> important<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
not so good so it's important that the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
not so good so it's important that the
gold<00:01:09.990> looks<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.680> nice<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:10.890> shiny<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
gold looks you know nice and shiny and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.770 
gold looks you know nice and shiny and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
true to life

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.830 
true to life
the<00:01:13.470> second<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.060> little<00:01:15.360> spot

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the second thing is this little spot

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.710 
the second thing is this little spot
laminate<00:01:16.350> decal<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> side<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.850> again

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
laminate decal on the side here again

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.649 
laminate decal on the side here again
same<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> gold<00:01:19.890> foiling<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:21.119> needs<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
same as the gold foiling really needs to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
same as the gold foiling really needs to
be<00:01:21.780> lit<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.159> gives<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> right

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
be lit right so it gives the right

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.030 
be lit right so it gives the right
amount<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.939> shine<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.750> goodness<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> brings

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
amount of shine and goodness and brings

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.490 
amount of shine and goodness and brings
out<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.700> enough<00:01:26.939> detail<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
out just enough detail in that there and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
out just enough detail in that there and
so<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.250> important<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so it's really important to get the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.850 
so it's really important to get the
label<00:01:30.299> looking<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.290> Schmidt<00:01:31.650> because

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
label looking you know Schmidt because

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.620 
label looking you know Schmidt because
you<00:01:31.979> spend<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.369> lot<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> time<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> effort<00:01:33.329> into

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you spend a lot of time and effort into

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.260 
you spend a lot of time and effort into
that<00:01:33.930> design<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.220> next<00:01:35.520> factor<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that design the next factor is the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
that design the next factor is the
bottle<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.840> actual<00:01:37.079> outside<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.740> bottle

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
bottle the actual outside of the bottle

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.940 
bottle the actual outside of the bottle
so<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> show<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.530> shiny

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
so we want to show that it's it's shiny

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.819 
so we want to show that it's it's shiny
like<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.340> bottles<00:01:41.640> around<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.450> reflective<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
like so bottles around and reflective so

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
like so bottles around and reflective so
