00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
you in the spring the next step is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.740 
you in the spring the next step is
removing<00:02:15.620> all<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.950> leaf<00:02:16.160> litter<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:17.450> leaf

removing all the leaf litter this leaf

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.690 
removing all the leaf litter this leaf

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
litter will overwinter fungus that we

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.090 
litter will overwinter fungus that we
