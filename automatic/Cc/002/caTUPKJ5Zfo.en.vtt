00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
York Times com just a guess and we'll

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.830 
York Times com just a guess and we'll
see<00:04:57.810> how<00:04:57.900> sites<00:04:58.140> like<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.380> look<00:04:58.920> on<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.910> iPad

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
see how sites like that look on the iPad

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.350 
see how sites like that look on the iPad
go<00:05:01.410> ahead<00:05:01.620> go<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.460> gotta<00:05:02.610> say<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:02.880> far

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
go ahead go and I gotta say so far

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.970 
go ahead go and I gotta say so far
typing<00:05:03.840> has<00:05:03.930> actually<00:05:04.290> been<00:05:04.380> surprisingly

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
typing has actually been surprisingly

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.410 
typing has actually been surprisingly
easy<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.400> again<00:05:05.580> I'll<00:05:05.700> do<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:05.850> full<00:05:06.060> video<00:05:06.390> on

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
easy and again I'll do a full video on

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.780 
easy and again I'll do a full video on
typing<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.020> how<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.230> works<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:08.340> here<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.670> go

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
typing and how it works but here you go

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.200 
typing and how it works but here you go
you<00:05:08.850> get<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.300> New<00:05:09.540> York<00:05:09.720> Times<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.260> very<00:05:10.530> big

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
you get the New York Times in a very big

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.190 
you get the New York Times in a very big
format<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.360> way<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:12.600> really<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:12.870> may<00:05:13.020> not

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
format the way that really you may not

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.810 
format the way that really you may not
be<00:05:13.290> used<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.590> seeing<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.070> scrolling

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
be used to seeing and scrolling

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.640 
be used to seeing and scrolling
everything<00:05:15.270> work<00:05:15.390> just<00:05:15.600> as<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.900> would<00:05:16.290> expect

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
everything work just as it would expect

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.890

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
and there is sort of embedded video in

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.870 
and there is sort of embedded video in
there<00:05:19.080> as<00:05:19.200> well<00:05:19.380> David<00:05:19.860> Pogue<00:05:20.040> on<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.310> iPad<00:05:20.670> so

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
there as well David Pogue on the iPad so

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.820 
there as well David Pogue on the iPad so
I'm<00:05:21.420> gonna<00:05:21.540> go<00:05:21.630> back<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.020> TechnoBuffalo<00:05:22.470> and

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
I'm gonna go back the TechnoBuffalo and

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.500 
I'm gonna go back the TechnoBuffalo and
show<00:05:22.950> you<00:05:23.010> what<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.220> difference<00:05:23.520> would<00:05:23.670> be<00:05:23.730> as

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
show you what the difference would be as

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.180 
show you what the difference would be as
compared<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.080> iPhone<00:05:25.200> again<00:05:25.890> I'll<00:05:26.040> do<00:05:26.160> a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
compared to the iPhone again I'll do a

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.740 
compared to the iPhone again I'll do a
full<00:05:26.430> video<00:05:26.580> comparing<00:05:27.180> these<00:05:27.270> two<00:05:27.480> but<00:05:27.660> as

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
full video comparing these two but as

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.470 
full video comparing these two but as
far<00:05:27.870> as<00:05:27.900> screen<00:05:28.230> real<00:05:28.350> estate<00:05:28.910> this<00:05:29.910> is<00:05:30.060> really

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
far as screen real estate this is really

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.910 
far as screen real estate this is really
the<00:05:30.600> difference<00:05:30.930> of<00:05:31.170> what<00:05:31.470> you've<00:05:31.590> seen<00:05:31.770> you

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
the difference of what you've seen you

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.950 
the difference of what you've seen you
can<00:05:32.070> tell<00:05:32.250> with<00:05:32.370> it's<00:05:32.520> very<00:05:32.700> small<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.630> craft

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
can tell with it's very small and craft

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.030 
can tell with it's very small and craft
right<00:05:34.080> here<00:05:34.230> it's<00:05:34.440> certainly<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.740> can<00:05:34.860> zoom

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
right here it's certainly you can zoom

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.150 
right here it's certainly you can zoom
in<00:05:35.280> as<00:05:36.210> you<00:05:36.300> can<00:05:36.480> on<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.690> iPad<00:05:37.080> but<00:05:37.650> it's<00:05:37.800> much

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
in as you can on the iPad but it's much

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.340 
in as you can on the iPad but it's much
much<00:05:38.490> larger<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.420> a<00:05:39.690> little<00:05:39.900> bit<00:05:40.020> lighter<00:05:40.260> on

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
much larger and a little bit lighter on

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.850 
much larger and a little bit lighter on
the<00:05:40.470> eyes<00:05:40.710> on<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:42.330> iPad<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.410> little<00:05:43.740> bit

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
the eyes on the iPad it's a little bit

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.770 
the eyes on the iPad it's a little bit
easier<00:05:43.890> to<00:05:44.160> read<00:05:44.340> because<00:05:44.490> it's<00:05:44.790> so<00:05:45.000> big

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
easier to read because it's so big

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.910 
easier to read because it's so big
well<00:05:46.050> you<00:05:46.140> really<00:05:46.350> do<00:05:46.500> feel<00:05:46.710> like<00:05:46.770> you're

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
well you really do feel like you're

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.610 
well you really do feel like you're
getting<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.760> full<00:05:48.000> web<00:05:48.300> experience<00:05:48.930> even

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
getting the full web experience even

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.260 
getting the full web experience even
though<00:05:49.770> one<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.340> Noxon<00:05:50.760> is<00:05:50.910> a<00:05:50.940> little<00:05:51.180> bit

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
though one of the Noxon is a little bit

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.300 
though one of the Noxon is a little bit
limited<00:05:51.600> with<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.750> lack<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:51.960> flash<00:05:52.350> apples

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
limited with the lack of flash apples

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.800 
limited with the lack of flash apples
certainly<00:05:53.700> pushing<00:05:53.970> there<00:05:54.240> alternative

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
certainly pushing there alternative

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.980 
certainly pushing there alternative
which<00:05:55.560> is<00:05:55.590> html5<00:05:56.520> but<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:57.390> can<00:05:57.510> just<00:05:57.690> see<00:05:57.840> the

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
which is html5 but you can just see the

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.120 
which is html5 but you can just see the
difference<00:05:58.290> on<00:05:58.350> screen<00:05:58.650> real<00:05:58.770> estate<00:05:58.830> and

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
difference on screen real estate and

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.800 
difference on screen real estate and
what<00:05:59.250> browsing<00:05:59.610> would<00:05:59.730> look<00:05:59.880> like<00:06:00.090> I'm<00:06:00.600> also

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
what browsing would look like I'm also

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.390 
what browsing would look like I'm also
bit<00:06:01.020> skeptical<00:06:01.470> why<00:06:01.740> do<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:01.920> need<00:06:01.980> a<00:06:02.100> device

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
bit skeptical why do I need a device

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.980 
bit skeptical why do I need a device
where<00:06:02.700> I<00:06:02.730> can<00:06:03.030> just<00:06:03.180> browse<00:06:03.420> but<00:06:03.630> I<00:06:03.690> can<00:06:03.810> do<00:06:03.900> it

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
where I can just browse but I can do it
