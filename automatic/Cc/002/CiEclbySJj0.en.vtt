we're<00:00:38.329> used<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.600> here<00:00:38.899> but<00:00:39.199> it<00:00:39.350> wasn't<00:00:39.530> as<00:00:39.739> cold

that's how they catch their seals which
is<00:01:11.030> what<00:01:11.480> makes<00:01:11.660> up<00:01:11.870> most<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.230> their<00:01:12.380> diet<00:01:12.410> so

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
is what makes up most of their diet so

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.650 
is what makes up most of their diet so
without<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.700> ice<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:14.060> can't<00:01:14.270> catch<00:01:14.450> their

led<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.050> some<00:01:18.200> tragic<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:18.890> desperate

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
led to some tragic and desperate

I<00:01:55.460> was<00:01:55.970> inspired<00:01:56.360> by<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.750> trip<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.320> really

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
I was inspired by the trip it really

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.550 
I was inspired by the trip it really
made<00:01:58.220> me<00:01:58.310> realize<00:01:58.490> what<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:58.880> going<00:01:59.150> on

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
made me realize what is going on

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.760 
made me realize what is going on
and<00:01:59.710> that<00:02:00.670> there<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:00.970> problem<00:02:01.300> I'm<00:02:01.780> doing<00:02:02.680> a
