00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that net so that those those channels

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.840 
that net so that those those channels
will<00:00:55.800> send<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> Gulf<00:00:56.219> Cup<00:00:56.399> through<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> ball

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that's right correct and plus the fact

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.039

golf<00:01:19.409> shots<00:01:19.619> went<00:01:19.799> out<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.340> well

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
golf shots went out with this one well

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
golf shots went out with this one well
exactly<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.420> otherwise<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:22.200> you're

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
exactly because otherwise now you're

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
exactly because otherwise now you're
manipulating<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:23.820> shouldn't<00:01:24.210> do

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
manipulating and you really shouldn't do

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
manipulating and you really shouldn't do
that<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> big

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that that's right what is the big

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
that that's right what is the big
problem<00:01:25.799> why<00:01:26.430> does<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.000> many<00:01:27.180> middle<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.810> high

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
problem why does so many middle and high

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.710 
problem why does so many middle and high
handicappers<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.770> even<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> pros<00:01:29.159> sometimes

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
handicappers and even the pros sometimes

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.780 
handicappers and even the pros sometimes
chunk<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.200> 30<00:01:31.619> yards<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.130> n<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.610> so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
chunk it from 30 yards and n what is so

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.999 
chunk it from 30 yards and n what is so
hard<00:01:33.030> about<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.479> basic<00:01:33.840> chip<00:01:34.290> shot<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> basic

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
hard about the basic chip shot the basic

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
hard about the basic chip shot the basic
pitch<00:01:35.220> shy<00:01:35.520> basically<00:01:36.299> when<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.420> open<00:01:36.720> your

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
pitch shy basically when you open your

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
pitch shy basically when you open your
stance<00:01:37.110> okay<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.680> swing<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> club<00:01:38.430> back<00:01:38.460> off

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
stance okay you swing the club back off

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
stance okay you swing the club back off
line<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.329> off<00:01:39.420> plane<00:01:39.750> once<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> gets<00:01:40.920> off<00:01:41.100> plane

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
line or off plane once it gets off plane

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
line or off plane once it gets off plane
and<00:01:41.490> come<00:01:41.640> steep<00:01:41.970> once<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> become<00:01:42.960> steep<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and come steep once you become steep you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.929 
and come steep once you become steep you
have<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> tendency<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.979> chunk<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> hit<00:01:44.640> then

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
have a tendency to chunk it hit then

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.130 
have a tendency to chunk it hit then
depend<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.780> hands

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
depend on what you do with your hands

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.679 
depend on what you do with your hands
that's<00:01:46.979> why<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.189> got<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> aim<00:01:47.520> square<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that's why you got to aim square so you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.940 
that's why you got to aim square so you
got<00:01:48.810> integrate<00:01:49.170> target<00:01:49.500> once<00:01:49.710> you're<00:01:49.829> off

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
got integrate target once you're off

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.620 
got integrate target once you're off
plane<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> figure<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.479> how<00:01:51.570> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
plane now you got to figure out how to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.670 
plane now you got to figure out how to
hit<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.020> thing<00:01:52.170> coming<00:01:52.439> from<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.649> different

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
hit that thing coming from a different

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
hit that thing coming from a different
angle<00:01:52.979> you've<00:01:53.280> already<00:01:53.490> used<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
angle you've already used to it like a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480 
angle you've already used to it like a
700<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:54.990> 8-iron<00:01:55.229> road<00:01:55.439> driver<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.430> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
700 an 8-iron road driver you know you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
700 an 8-iron road driver you know you
got<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.000> plane<00:01:57.240> well<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.560> thing

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
got to be on plane well the one thing

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.469 
got to be on plane well the one thing
about<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> sole<00:01:59.250> channels<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.270> they

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
about the sole channels that they

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.690 
about the sole channels that they
creates<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.280> reduced

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
creates it's it's it's a reduced

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
creates it's it's it's a reduced
resistance<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> impact<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
resistance and impact so because I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.050 
resistance and impact so because I
channels<00:02:05.009> you're<00:02:05.579> not<00:02:05.700> getting<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
channels you're not getting that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
channels you're not getting that
resistance<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> grass<00:02:07.079> especially<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
resistance with the grass especially the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
resistance with the grass especially the
high<00:02:08.190> rough<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> even<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> sand<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.360> the

high rough and even the sand in the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.089 
high rough and even the sand in the
bunkers<00:02:09.750> correct<00:02:09.989> correct<00:02:10.349> correct<00:02:10.649> that's

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
bunkers correct correct correct that's

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.290 
bunkers correct correct correct that's
why<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.580> why<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.910> aim<00:02:12.030> square

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
why you that's why you can aim square

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.910 
why you that's why you can aim square
now<00:02:12.480> because<00:02:12.750> there's<00:02:12.900> no<00:02:13.020> resistance

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
now because there's no resistance

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.320 
now because there's no resistance
you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.400> right<00:02:14.550> through<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> sand<00:02:15.150> right

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you can go right through the sand right

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.580 
you can go right through the sand right
through<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.599> grass<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.050> get<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.319> right<00:02:16.440> where

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
through the grass and get it right where

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.990 
through the grass and get it right where
you're<00:02:16.680> looking<00:02:16.800> well<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.610> got<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.819> be

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you're looking well it's got to be

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.339 
you're looking well it's got to be
terrible<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.630> out<00:02:18.780> there<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:19.170> I'm

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
terrible for you out there because I'm

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.320 
terrible for you out there because I'm
the<00:02:19.470> same<00:02:19.709> way<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.980> play<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:20.910> your<00:02:21.239> other

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the same way you play all of your other

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.570 
the same way you play all of your other
shots<00:02:21.720> lining<00:02:22.319> at<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> target<00:02:22.950> club<00:02:23.220> face<00:02:23.430> of

the target body parallel to the target
and<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> sudden<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.220> get<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> bunker

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
and all of a sudden you get the bunker

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.880 
and all of a sudden you get the bunker
you<00:02:26.880> get<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> short<00:02:27.330> shot<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.870> lob<00:02:28.349> shot<00:02:28.680> or<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
you get a short shot a lob shot or a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590 
you get a short shot a lob shot or a
chip<00:02:29.099> shot<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.489> like<00:02:29.790> Mike<00:02:30.030> said<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.420> you're

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
chip shot and like Mike said now you're

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.090 
chip shot and like Mike said now you're
all<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> sudden<00:02:31.050> we're<00:02:31.200> taught<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.410> open<00:02:31.920> up

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
all of a sudden we're taught to open up

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.820 
all of a sudden we're taught to open up
open<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.850> clubface<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:34.170> manipulation

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
open the clubface it's just manipulation

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.080 
open the clubface it's just manipulation
that<00:02:34.920> doesn't<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> happen<00:02:35.459> that's<00:02:35.910> right

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that doesn't have to happen that's right

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.330 
that doesn't have to happen that's right
that's<00:02:37.050> right<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.350> what<00:02:37.470> happens<00:02:37.830> when<00:02:37.890> they

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
that's right and what happens when they

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.309
