fortressCraft<00:02:54.209> made<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> million<00:02:55.410> dollars<00:02:55.799> off

fortressCraft made a million dollars off

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.240

of<00:02:56.430> Xbox<00:02:57.060> Live<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.680> that's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
of Xbox Live and I think that that's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.160 
of Xbox Live and I think that that's
it's<00:02:59.819> pretty<00:03:00.120> awesome<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:00.599> when<00:03:00.720> minecraft

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
it's pretty awesome but when minecraft

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.509 
it's pretty awesome but when minecraft
comes<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.769> even<00:03:01.980> going<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.160> exist

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
comes it's not even going to exist

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.400 
comes it's not even going to exist
anymore<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:02.940> they<00:03:03.720> should<00:03:03.900> hold<00:03:04.049> on<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.200> that

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
anymore so they should hold on to that
