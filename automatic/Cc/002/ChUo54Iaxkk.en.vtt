00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.529 
on Rockport the LP 700 in and let's add
some<00:04:40.270> runway<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:41.440> ccxr<00:04:42.130> hits<00:04:42.699> a<00:04:42.849> higher<00:04:43.090> speed

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
some runway the ccxr hits a higher speed

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.909 
some runway the ccxr hits a higher speed
much<00:04:43.930> faster<00:04:43.960> than<00:04:44.470> milky<00:04:44.860> 700<00:04:45.660> so<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:47.199> ccxr

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
much faster than milky 700 so the ccxr

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.939 
much faster than milky 700 so the ccxr
should<00:04:48.569> probably<00:04:49.569> always<00:04:49.840> win<00:04:50.259> on<00:04:50.560> longer

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
should probably always win on longer

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.490 
should probably always win on longer

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
drag tracks while the LP some 100 will

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.140 
drag tracks while the LP some 100 will
do<00:04:53.650> much<00:04:53.860> better<00:04:54.160> on<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.430> shorter<00:04:54.910> direct

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150
