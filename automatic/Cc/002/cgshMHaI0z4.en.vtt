trade well that was the hope that you
saw<00:00:06.660> earlier<00:00:06.690> we<00:00:07.589> call<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.830> method<00:00:08.160> of

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
saw earlier we call that method of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.780 
saw earlier we call that method of
taking<00:00:08.639> pin<00:00:09.120> by<00:00:09.300> pin<00:00:10.010> then<00:00:11.010> there's<00:00:11.190> breaking

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
taking pin by pin then there's breaking

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.120 
taking pin by pin then there's breaking
with<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> Rachel<00:00:13.049> you'll<00:00:13.500> notice<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
with a Rachel you'll notice you have the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.480 
with a Rachel you'll notice you have the
discipline<00:00:14.519> state<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.830> angle<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.160> very

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
discipline state now the angle is very

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.160 
discipline state now the angle is very
important<00:00:18.029> okay<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.779> you're<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> keep

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
important okay so you're going to keep

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.230 
important okay so you're going to keep
it<00:00:19.439> horizontal<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.490> you're<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.119> make

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
it horizontal and you're going to make

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.820 
it horizontal and you're going to make
long<00:00:21.859> quick<00:00:22.970> sweeping<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.300> shallow<00:00:24.830> oval

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
long quick sweeping but shallow oval

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.759 
long quick sweeping but shallow oval
Moses<00:00:26.279> okay<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:27.990> very<00:00:28.380> slightly

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
Moses okay and that really very slightly

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.490 
Moses okay and that really very slightly

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
dull and they're very easy to get into

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
dull and they're very easy to get into
so<00:00:31.500> how<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.070> set<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.730> how<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> make

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so how do you set up in how do you make

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.870 
so how do you set up in how do you make
the<00:00:33.899> rock<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> seasoned<00:00:35.489> side<00:00:35.730> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the rock think that a seasoned side of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
the rock think that a seasoned side of
it<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.809> day<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.200> and

to push this entire project up you start

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
to push this entire project up you start
by<00:00:50.969> turning<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> cylinder<00:00:51.780> slightly<00:00:52.079> putting

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
by turning the cylinder slightly putting

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
by turning the cylinder slightly putting
a<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> tension<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.850> push

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
a little bit of tension on it then push

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.869 
a little bit of tension on it then push
both<00:00:54.480> pins<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.620> time<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.430> second

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
both pins up at the same time the second

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
both pins up at the same time the second
that<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> fear<00:00:57.629> line<00:00:57.870> hits<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.469> gap<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.890> the

that that fear line hits the gap of the
pin<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.059> cylinder<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> turn<00:01:01.109> very

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pin the cylinder is going to turn very

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
pin the cylinder is going to turn very
slightly<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> millimeter<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.090> less<00:01:03.390> it's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
slightly like a millimeter or less it's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.649 
slightly like a millimeter or less it's
very<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:04.170> slight<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.890> delicate<00:01:05.430> touch<00:01:05.659> you

very very slight very delicate touch you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.240 
very very slight very delicate touch you
can<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> wind<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.170> doing<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> time

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
can the wind up doing this one at a time

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859 
can the wind up doing this one at a time
because<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:08.850> than<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.330> came<00:01:09.630> in

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
because there are more than one came in

gonna own one I want to talk your
attention<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.180> little<00:01:18.390> tool<00:01:18.689> at<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
attention to this little tool at the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
attention to this little tool at the
bottom<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> talk<00:01:19.830> about<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
bottom we're going to talk about it in a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
bottom we're going to talk about it in a
minute<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.420> don't<00:01:21.659> forget<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.439> keep

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
minute but don't forget it don't keep

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:37.140 
minute but don't forget it don't keep
your<00:01:22.740> eye<00:01:22.799> off<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.400> school

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:46.490 

like

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:06.840 

Oh

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:18.630 

theory<00:02:07.850> so<00:02:08.179> simple

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:42.490 

obviously

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.300 

one

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
one

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.000 
one
ok
