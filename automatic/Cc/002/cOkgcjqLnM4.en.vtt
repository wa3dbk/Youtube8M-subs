I<00:02:13.940> haven't<00:02:14.209> run<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.629> instance<00:02:15.140> since<00:02:15.530> my

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
I haven't run this instance since my

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.680 
I haven't run this instance since my
main<00:02:16.129> account<00:02:16.430> Gears<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.819> War<00:02:16.940> was<00:02:17.360> around

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
this level so I'm pretty much don't know

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.339 
this level so I'm pretty much don't know
where<00:02:21.590> I'm<00:02:21.739> going<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.580> point<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.180> find<00:02:24.170> out

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
where I'm going at this point I find out

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.050 
where I'm going at this point I find out
later<00:02:24.379> that<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.099> go<00:02:25.250> through<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.610> hole<00:02:25.819> in

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
later that you go through the hole in

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.780 
later that you go through the hole in
the<00:02:26.150> middle<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:28.040> does<00:02:28.220> not<00:02:28.250> come<00:02:28.579> to<00:02:28.670> my

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the middle but that does not come to my

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.759 
the middle but that does not come to my
benefit<00:02:29.209> as<00:02:29.360> you'll<00:02:29.599> see<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.989> little<00:02:30.110> bit<00:02:30.260> so

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
benefit as you'll see in a little bit so

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.440 
benefit as you'll see in a little bit so
