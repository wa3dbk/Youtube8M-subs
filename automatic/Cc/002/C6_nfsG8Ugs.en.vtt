00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello we continue with exercise 13 in 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.809
 its numeral 7 we have the square of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.700
 these squared between 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:18.750
 parentheses we have issues of 33 more than 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.609
 which it is 4 ha less squared to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.029
 it is one that is squared 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.980
 in parentheses in the image m is a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.930
 medium plus n 503 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.930
 + 2 xx 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.920
 then let's first solve what 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.100
 the pairs we have all raised to 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.770
 square 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.460
 three four of seven 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.290
 minus 1 squared and this 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.580
 parentheses according to medium plus two thirds 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.980
 a half plus two thirds we multiply 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.199
 two by 36 now even one by three 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.289
 three two 24 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:05.149
 347 is about six would be seven insects 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.149
 the operation from parentheses 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 plus two times zero that is d 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.860
 we continue now solving the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.310
 powers 2 raised to squares 4 or 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.350
 remove this parenthesis 4 by 7 minus one 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.680
 squared is one that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.740
 multiply seven sixths we remove this 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.570
 parentheses more if we solve first the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.890
 multiplications among the four by 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.140
 728 minus 1 for 7 sixths anything 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.380
 multiplied by one gives us the same 7 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.030
 effects more all remember to add with 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.960
 zero gives the same then we will do 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.399
 28 7 628 we put a new player 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.380
 of fraction minus 76 we multiply 1 by 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:58.380
 66 and now in 138 by 66 by 48 46 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:03.140
 points 24 16 minus 177 178 minus seven 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.140
 would give us 161 are 6 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.610
 then the result of this operation 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.510
 would be 162 sixths and 162 this is the value 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.819
 Numeric of the algebraic expression 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.620
 8 we have 2 that multiplies am that is a 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.739
 nerve that multiplies x which is 0 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.590
 I read the open parenthesis Square 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.560
 everything is squared up more than 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.950
 high stress of the square we close 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.280
 parenthesis minus 4 that multiplies that 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.849
 is 4 squared we start to 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.500
 do the operations here we have some 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.209
 multiplications where the 0 intervenes 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.849
 whenever in several multiplications 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.990
 repeated are intervening the 0 that 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.210
 result would give us 0 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.340
 then six first springs of 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.290
 parentheses two squared that 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.770
 it's four plus it grows squared 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.690
 which is nine minus four here we can 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.140
 get this 4x4 square 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.930
 5 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.510
 we continue but more because this zero and 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.700
 would not affect anything we would have six that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.090
 multiply the parenthesis 4 manuel 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.069
 which is 13 minus 4 times 16 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.140
 we have the multiplication here 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.810
 a subtraction and multiplication first 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.830
 we must solve the multiplications 6 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:34.010
 by 13 by 36 18 an adviser arrived 16 and 17 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:36.860
 78 minus 4 times 16 than 64 78 ones 64 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.280
 would be 14 14 the numerical value for the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.090
 generalized expression 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.100
 9 we have then in parentheses a 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.850
 sum of fractions in the numerator of the 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.710
 first we have 8 by m 8 that multiplies 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.430
 am that is a 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.390
 in the denominator 9 multiplies in two 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.810
 thirds 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.620
 in the second we have 16 that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.130
 multiply ap 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.030
 quarter 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.790
 about this 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.130
 and that all multiplies what is 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.450
 let's start to operate then 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.350
 we have in our fractions 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.950
 to operate we put him to 81 to 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:32.400
 can multiply 9 and 16 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:34.110
 we would have 8 by 18 over 29 by 218 and 1 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.440
 by 33 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.070
 in the second fraction we would have 16 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.390
 116 have to name 1 by 44 and in the 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.310
 denominator of the large fraction 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.650
 allowed heap multiplying av 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.220
 we continue then let's simplify 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.870
 a little 8 between 2 would give us 4 in the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.320
 part of below and the fact of again 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.830
 would be 6 + 16 lived 4 which is 4 over two 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.390
 what multiplies av 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.390
 that makes a little space 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.660
 and we can continue to simplify 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.580
 fractions then four texts of what 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.520
 same as having two thirds pulling 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.410
 half up down plus four days between 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.830
 two would give us two 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.830
 all x 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.199
 let's do the operation of the 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:30.959
 parentheses that station plus two thirds 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.359
 more everyone to 2 we put a 1 below 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:36.899
 so that the wall between fractions 3 by 

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:42.689
 1 stress now included by 12 plus three 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:46.249
 for 262 thousand 608 on 38 third we 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.529
 would be in parentheses 8 third 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.289
 that multiplies to 1 but any the 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.719
 number x 1 be the same then we 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:57.429
 would give 808 thirds from the value 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.429
 Numeric of the algebraic expression
