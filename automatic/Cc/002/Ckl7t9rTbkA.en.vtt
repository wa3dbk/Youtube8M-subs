00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.200 

much<00:00:24.680> after<00:00:25.009> these<00:00:25.160> Eva's<00:00:25.670> on<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:25.970> first

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
much after these Eva's on this first

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.920 
much after these Eva's on this first
turn

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.960 

it<00:00:30.930> can<00:00:31.109> either<00:00:31.199> take<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.099> ear<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.610> go<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
it can either take the you ear to go of

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.260 
it can either take the you ear to go of
that<00:00:33.150> half<00:00:33.360> piping<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:33.960> those<00:00:34.110> items

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.990 

down<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.200> river<00:00:38.350> we<00:00:38.680> go

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.650 

took<00:00:46.510> me<00:00:46.660> forever<00:00:46.810> to<00:00:47.050> find<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.410> good<00:00:47.500> line<00:00:47.770> here

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
took me forever to find a good line here

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.690 
took me forever to find a good line here
but<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:49.720> eventually<00:00:50.020> found<00:00:50.530> one

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.310 

watch<00:00:57.700> out<00:00:57.910> for<00:00:58.090> this<00:00:58.210> electricity<00:00:59.079> through

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
watch out for this electricity through

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.310 
watch out for this electricity through
here<00:00:59.649> if<00:01:00.129> you<00:01:00.309> touch<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.149> you'll<00:01:01.540> get<00:01:01.690> swamped

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
here if you touch it you'll get swamped

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.020 
here if you touch it you'll get swamped
similar<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.430> lightning<00:01:03.790> bolt

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
similar to that of the lightning bolt

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
similar to that of the lightning bolt
item

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.530 

it<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.740> better<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> motto

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
it is better to get out of the motto

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.970 
it is better to get out of the motto
than<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:10.260> shrunk<00:01:12.590> driving<00:01:13.590> through<00:01:13.770> this

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
than get shrunk driving through this

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.160 
than get shrunk driving through this
water<00:01:14.340> will<00:01:14.700> most<00:01:15.030> likely<00:01:15.300> result<00:01:15.660> in<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
water will most likely result in you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:31.450 
water will most likely result in you
going<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.830> edge

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.310 

there's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.729> gap<00:01:33.149> beyond<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.140> up

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
there's a little gap beyond this way up

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.030 
there's a little gap beyond this way up
so<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.680> careful

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.740 

one<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.280> things<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.850> about<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
one of the things I like about the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.500 
one of the things I like about the
standard<00:01:43.110> cart<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.800> while<00:01:44.400> it<00:01:45.090> isn't<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
standard cart is that while it isn't the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.780 
standard cart is that while it isn't the
fastest<00:01:46.020> part<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.860> does<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.180> good<00:01:48.570> area<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
fastest part it does have a good area of

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.940 
fastest part it does have a good area of
strengths<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.420> many<00:01:51.600> weaknesses

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
strengths and not that many weaknesses

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.640 
strengths and not that many weaknesses
however<00:01:52.950> its<00:01:53.160> main<00:01:53.550> weakness<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.300> lack<00:01:54.570> of

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
however its main weakness is a lack of

00:01:54.650 --> 00:03:05.010 
however its main weakness is a lack of
specialization

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.020 

what<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.620> found<00:03:05.980> through<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.400> line<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.880> that

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
what I found through this line is that

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.590 
what I found through this line is that
it's<00:03:07.300> actually<00:03:07.690> easier<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.320> take<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.590> outside

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
it's actually easier to take the outside

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.240 
it's actually easier to take the outside
one<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.750> few<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.380> my<00:03:11.530> opinion<00:03:11.920> then<00:03:12.070> it's

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
one of the few in my opinion then it's

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:26.589 
one of the few in my opinion then it's
better<00:03:12.490> just<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.880> guess

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.080 

why<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.170> hekawis<00:03:27.620> racing<00:03:28.129> in<00:03:28.310> water<00:03:28.609> under

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
why the hekawis racing in water under

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:44.500 
why the hekawis racing in water under
water<00:03:29.359> that<00:03:29.930> doesn't<00:03:30.739> make<00:03:30.829> sense<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.280> me

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.390 

and<00:03:45.510> whoo-whoo<00:03:46.140> we<00:03:46.680> won

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and whoo-whoo we won

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.200 
and whoo-whoo we won
now<00:03:47.939> we're<00:03:48.180> going<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.569> next<00:03:48.780> race
