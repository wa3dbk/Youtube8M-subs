00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
really cool and most current devices

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
really cool and most current devices
should<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.619> lag<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.850> my
