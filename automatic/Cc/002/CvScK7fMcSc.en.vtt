spaces<00:06:14.870> can<00:06:15.020> animate<00:06:15.469> the<00:06:15.710> change<00:06:15.979> from<00:06:16.159> one

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
spaces can animate the change from one

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.300 
spaces can animate the change from one
space<00:06:16.669> to<00:06:16.729> another<00:06:17.500> I'll<00:06:18.500> check<00:06:18.860> this<00:06:19.039> and

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
space to another I'll check this and

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.980 
space to another I'll check this and
assign<00:06:19.580> a<00:06:19.610> transition<00:06:20.270> time<00:06:20.479> of<00:06:20.719> 1.5<00:06:21.380> seconds

assign a transition time of 1.5 seconds

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.839 
assign a transition time of 1.5 seconds
now<00:06:23.990> as<00:06:24.199> I<00:06:24.319> change<00:06:24.530> spaces<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.310> backgrounds

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
now as I change spaces the backgrounds

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.269 
now as I change spaces the backgrounds
fade<00:06:26.090> into<00:06:26.330> each<00:06:26.539> other<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:27.680> space<00:06:27.949> names

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:28.279 
fade into each other and the space names

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:33.120 
fade into each other and the space names
slide<00:06:28.759> to<00:06:29.060> their<00:06:29.210> new<00:06:29.360> position

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.430 

so<00:06:34.130> that's<00:06:34.340> hyper<00:06:34.580> spaces<00:06:35.150> you've<00:06:36.139> tried

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
so that's hyper spaces you've tried

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.800 
so that's hyper spaces you've tried
using<00:06:36.620> spaces<00:06:37.069> before<00:06:37.400> and<00:06:37.910> decided<00:06:38.539> not<00:06:38.660> to

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
using spaces before and decided not to

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.379 
using spaces before and decided not to
stick<00:06:39.050> with<00:06:39.229> it<00:06:39.520> Hyper's<00:06:40.520> faces<00:06:40.970> might<00:06:41.180> add

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
stick with it Hyper's faces might add

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.999 
stick with it Hyper's faces might add

visual cues and hyper spaces make it

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.469 
visual cues and hyper spaces make it
