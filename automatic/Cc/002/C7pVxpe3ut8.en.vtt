00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.830
 actually a very strange case for years long enough if you get dirty 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.430
 guests buyer the police could take full advantage of for years 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.680
 and happens in europe 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.919
 virtually nothing 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.229
 the municipality all major brands wake up 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:16.949
 volkswagen the title arrives on all devices soon there will also be colleague 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:17.529
 as 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.740
 and this is then the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.740
 dea 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.080
 and although on and this branch of sport has never really done anything 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.570
 maybe then immediately recognizable for the so-called kinetic 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 design is that sharp lines are the vast majority of shares 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720
 6 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.680
 we try to achieve and therefore share the infocus atmosphere very much with 11 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.420
 I think the centimeters players are not clear that the only one in 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.430
 the netherlands is coming 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.660
 further decided that the trend especially says decided whether the products 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.460
 cheaper eliminated we can get our country is simple reason for that 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.340
 It is also we can have 800 be bought in the Netherlands the production is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.240
 limited 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.270
 and indeed the height, but then one reason why is not immediately critical 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 therein, just like on the other misconduct of the drivers 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 in short, standing before hot fires has everything to do with Volkswagen on earlier 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.620
 over the years 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.160
 and get to know animal welfare as an excellent medium-sized trip 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.950
 celebration 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.880
 Fred Mac is provided but the good news is the tukkers will too 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.340
 very good authors he is wonderfully comfortable he is not laughing hard too 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.720
 not when needed he sharply sharp and sporty enough 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.100
 so good that they can expect from fort 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 that motor extension a little longer older mother but may well be possible later 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 opt for the fifth day gasoline engine at the end of this year 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.070
 this one already has a six-speed tank that is very tasty and instantly turns on the gas 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
 optionally becomes leeuwarden six-speed gearbox or an automatic 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 6 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.500
 or this done today that I just think so 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.970
 wear practical ease of use, the cars are very close to each other finish 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.259
 tyrol ditto ditto 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.689
 the steering of this sport is just a bit more refined and sharper than with the tiguan 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.719
 on the other hand, the volkswagen offers much more choice from the perspective 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.719
 foods it is a little idea to get the audi a3 for dozens of executions 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.359
 as long as it is me in it it is a fantastic weather and I saw her stay 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.200
 but must write a report from the Netherlands on the extended row 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.560
 That is in car week number 19 on May 7 in the store
