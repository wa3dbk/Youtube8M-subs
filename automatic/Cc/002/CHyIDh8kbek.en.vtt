00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
I go with a thunderpunch on way award

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.300 
I go with a thunderpunch on way award
because<00:06:47.930> I<00:06:48.229> know<00:06:48.289> that<00:06:48.620> that<00:06:48.800> will<00:06:49.009> hopefully

ever anyway I got a lucky flinch with a

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.149 
ever anyway I got a lucky flinch with a
magnezone<00:07:05.599> so<00:07:05.900> that<00:07:06.020> was<00:07:06.169> nice<00:07:06.319> the<00:07:06.979> trick

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
magnezone so that was nice the trick

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.769 
magnezone so that was nice the trick
room<00:07:07.340> goes<00:07:07.639> down<00:07:07.879> the<00:07:08.120> same<00:07:08.270> storm<00:07:08.599> is<00:07:08.719> still

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:08.779 
room goes down the same storm is still

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:10.989 
room goes down the same storm is still
going<00:07:09.050> blah<00:07:09.439> blah<00:07:09.590> blah<00:07:09.669> anyway<00:07:10.669> at<00:07:10.819> this

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:10.999 
going blah blah blah anyway at this

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.909 
going blah blah blah anyway at this
point<00:07:11.240> I<00:07:11.360> was<00:07:11.479> like<00:07:11.599> okay<00:07:12.409> what<00:07:12.650> should<00:07:12.680> I<00:07:12.860> do

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
point I was like okay what should I do

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:15.159 
point I was like okay what should I do
here<00:07:13.310> should<00:07:13.550> i<00:07:13.580> go<00:07:13.729> for<00:07:13.879> fire<00:07:14.210> punch<00:07:14.449> or<00:07:14.779> what

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:15.169 
here should i go for fire punch or what

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.040 
here should i go for fire punch or what
so<00:07:15.529> i<00:07:15.740> go<00:07:16.550> with<00:07:16.759> a<00:07:16.789> fire<00:07:17.029> punch<00:07:17.300> to<00:07:17.599> begin<00:07:17.900> with

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
so i go with a fire punch to begin with

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.570 
so i go with a fire punch to begin with
and<00:07:18.259> that's<00:07:18.379> like<00:07:18.620> you<00:07:19.129> know<00:07:19.250> what<00:07:19.430> actually

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
and that's like you know what actually

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.640 
and that's like you know what actually
since<00:07:20.120> golem<00:07:20.509> always<00:07:20.779> goes<00:07:20.960> first<00:07:20.990> that<00:07:21.439> means

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
since golem always goes first that means

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.429 
since golem always goes first that means
he's<00:07:22.069> the<00:07:22.370> slowest<00:07:22.879> so<00:07:23.449> i'll<00:07:23.870> go<00:07:24.110> with<00:07:24.259> an

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:24.439 
he's the slowest so i'll go with an

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:26.769 
he's the slowest so i'll go with an
earthquake<00:07:24.919> and<00:07:25.159> then<00:07:25.490> a<00:07:25.520> bone<00:07:25.849> rang<00:07:26.180> just<00:07:26.629> in

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:26.779 
earthquake and then a bone rang just in

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.070 
earthquake and then a bone rang just in
case<00:07:26.930> bone<00:07:27.169> ranked<00:07:27.469> mrs.<00:07:27.860> i'll<00:07:28.099> make<00:07:28.699> sure<00:07:28.729> to

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 
case bone ranked mrs. i'll make sure to

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.719 
case bone ranked mrs. i'll make sure to
hit<00:07:30.080> it<00:07:30.199> with<00:07:30.289> earthquake<00:07:30.740> and<00:07:30.949> right<00:07:31.460> then<00:07:31.699> I

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:31.729 
hit it with earthquake and right then I

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.610 
hit it with earthquake and right then I
was<00:07:32.060> like<00:07:32.090> oh<00:07:32.300> crap<00:07:32.599> no<00:07:32.750> I<00:07:32.990> didn't<00:07:33.319> mean<00:07:33.349> to<00:07:33.500> do

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
was like oh crap no I didn't mean to do

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.559 
was like oh crap no I didn't mean to do
thunderpunch<00:07:34.219> I<00:07:34.490> accidentally<00:07:34.909> hit<00:07:35.029> Thunder

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:35.569 
thunderpunch I accidentally hit Thunder

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:36.969 
thunderpunch I accidentally hit Thunder
punch<00:07:35.750> and<00:07:36.020> that<00:07:36.110> would<00:07:36.259> have<00:07:36.289> really<00:07:36.560> sucked

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:36.979 
punch and that would have really sucked

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.779 
punch and that would have really sucked
but<00:07:37.939> anyway<00:07:38.240> um<00:07:38.620> go<00:07:39.620> the<00:07:39.800> bone<00:07:39.979> rang<00:07:40.310> of<00:07:40.520> course

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:40.789 
but anyway um go the bone rang of course

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:42.579 
but anyway um go the bone rang of course
just<00:07:41.629> take<00:07:41.810> a<00:07:41.839> little<00:07:41.990> bit<00:07:42.139> of<00:07:42.199> time<00:07:42.409> because

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:42.589 
just take a little bit of time because

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:46.480 
just take a little bit of time because
of<00:07:42.740> this<00:07:42.860> dumb<00:07:43.189> lag<00:07:43.520> and<00:07:44.169> ash<00:07:45.169> this<00:07:46.009> lag<00:07:46.249> is

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490 
of this dumb lag and ash this lag is

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.269 
of this dumb lag and ash this lag is
totally<00:07:46.879> ash<00:07:47.089> anyway<00:07:47.839> Magnezone<00:07:48.770> goes<00:07:49.009> for

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:49.279 
totally ash anyway Magnezone goes for

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:52.959 
totally ash anyway Magnezone goes for
discharge<00:07:50.469> don't<00:07:51.469> ask<00:07:51.710> me<00:07:51.949> why<00:07:52.129> but<00:07:52.550> it<00:07:52.819> went

00:07:58.209 --> 00:07:58.219 
dumbest moves I've ever seen to be

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:01.149 
dumbest moves I've ever seen to be
honest<00:07:58.669> yeah<00:07:59.060> I<00:07:59.089> mean<00:07:59.419> you<00:08:00.349> see<00:08:00.589> what<00:08:00.740> the<00:08:00.860> 4th

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 
honest yeah I mean you see what the 4th

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:03.269 
honest yeah I mean you see what the 4th
generation<00:08:01.490> has<00:08:02.060> done<00:08:02.330> to<00:08:02.539> people<00:08:02.659> it's<00:08:03.050> like
