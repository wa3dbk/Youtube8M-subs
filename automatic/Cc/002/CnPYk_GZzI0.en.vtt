is a little redstone II and I I have to
say<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.300> has<00:00:12.420> been<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> long<00:00:12.900> time<00:00:13.230> since<00:00:13.440> I've

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
say it has been a long time since I've

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.079 
say it has been a long time since I've
been<00:00:13.830> delving<00:00:14.040> into<00:00:14.309> redstone<00:00:14.820> I've<00:00:14.940> been

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
been delving into redstone I've been

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.359 
been delving into redstone I've been
doing<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> few<00:00:15.480> smaller<00:00:15.839> redstone<00:00:16.680> II<00:00:16.710> projects

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
doing a few smaller redstone II projects

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.179 
doing a few smaller redstone II projects
for<00:00:17.609> some<00:00:17.760> other<00:00:17.910> things<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.949> really<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
for some other things I really want to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.650 
for some other things I really want to
get<00:00:20.250> back<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> redstone<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> tinker<00:00:21.480> box

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
get back to redstone on the tinker box

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.509 
get back to redstone on the tinker box
not<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.500> say<00:00:22.619> I'm<00:00:22.740> getting<00:00:22.980> rid<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.369> the

not to say I'm getting rid of all the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.130 
not to say I'm getting rid of all the
testing<00:00:23.939> stuff<00:00:24.150> I've<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.570> doing<00:00:24.869> cuz<00:00:25.019> I've

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
testing stuff I've been doing cuz I've

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.650 
testing stuff I've been doing cuz I've
really<00:00:25.590> enjoyed<00:00:25.849> testing<00:00:26.849> things<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
really enjoyed testing things but I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.000 
really enjoyed testing things but I
really<00:00:27.750> miss<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> derping<00:00:28.560> around<00:00:28.619> with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
really miss a derping around with

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.650 
really miss a derping around with
redstone<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.580> had<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> good<00:00:30.090> fun<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.599> and

what are we on here for today
we<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:37.079> today<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:39.420> tea<00:00:39.719> flip-flop

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
we are on here today for a tea flip-flop

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.790 
we are on here today for a tea flip-flop
I<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:41.340> looking<00:00:41.760> around<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.200> trying<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
I was looking around and I was trying to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.720 
I was looking around and I was trying to
find<00:00:44.010> myself

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
find myself

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.200 
find myself
a<00:00:45.079> really<00:00:46.079> good<00:00:46.260> T<00:00:46.500> flip-flop<00:00:46.789> using<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> new

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
a really good T flip-flop using the new

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
a really good T flip-flop using the new
repeaters<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.590> couldn't<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:49.980> find<00:00:50.280> one

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
repeaters and I couldn't really find one

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.029 
repeaters and I couldn't really find one
okay<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.960> lie<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.289> found<00:00:52.530> plenty<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
okay well that's a lie I found plenty of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
okay well that's a lie I found plenty of
them<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.399> found<00:00:53.699> tons<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.480> lot<00:00:54.660> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
them I found tons of them and a lot of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.260 
them I found tons of them and a lot of
them<00:00:54.960> were<00:00:55.140> terrible<00:00:55.620> well<00:00:55.829> not<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.460> mean<00:00:56.789> there

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
there were some where I was like that is

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.770 
there were some where I was like that is
a<00:01:04.019> monstrosity<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:05.400> don't<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.880> why<00:01:06.180> anyone

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
a monstrosity I don't know why anyone

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.580 
a monstrosity I don't know why anyone
would<00:01:07.140> build<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> decided<00:01:09.150> hey<00:01:09.600> let<00:01:10.409> me

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
would build that so I decided hey let me

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
would build that so I decided hey let me
build<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:10.979> own<00:01:11.010> T<00:01:11.340> flip-flop<00:01:11.850> these<00:01:12.240> people

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
build my own T flip-flop these people

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.030 
build my own T flip-flop these people
are<00:01:12.659> building<00:01:12.780> T<00:01:13.049> flip-flops<00:01:13.560> I'm<00:01:13.770> not

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
are building T flip-flops I'm not

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.550 
are building T flip-flops I'm not
satisfied<00:01:14.280> let<00:01:14.790> me<00:01:14.850> satisfy<00:01:15.030> myself<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.350> this

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
satisfied let me satisfy myself so this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.780 
satisfied let me satisfy myself so this
is<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.860> I've<00:01:16.950> done<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.280> built<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> T

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
is what I've done I've built a T

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.289 
is what I've done I've built a T
flip-flop<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:20.610> interesting<00:01:21.150> thing

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
flip-flop and the interesting thing

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
flip-flop and the interesting thing
about<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.600> T<00:01:21.840> flip-flop<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.040> has<00:01:23.220> two

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
about this T flip-flop is it has two

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
about this T flip-flop is it has two
different<00:01:23.820> places<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.360> put<00:01:24.570> inflation

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
different places you can put inflation

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
different places you can put inflation
to<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.340> gives<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.000> lot<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> options

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
to it so it gives you a lot of options

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.319 
to it so it gives you a lot of options
and<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> probably<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> easiest<00:01:29.640> key

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and it is probably the easiest key

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
and it is probably the easiest key
flip-flop<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> world<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.770> build<00:01:31.979> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
flip-flop in the world to build it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.990 
flip-flop in the world to build it's
beautiful<00:01:33.180> absolutely<00:01:33.900> beautiful<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
beautiful absolutely beautiful and it is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.789 
beautiful absolutely beautiful and it is
a<00:01:36.150> flip-flop<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.200> means<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> toggle

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
a flip-flop so that means I can toggle

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.240 
a flip-flop so that means I can toggle
it<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.880> also<00:01:39.030> toggle<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:40.250> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it here but I can also toggle it here so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.380 
it here but I can also toggle it here so
I<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.640> really<00:01:41.820> interesting<00:01:41.909> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I think it's really interesting that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
I think it's really interesting that
both<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.780> these<00:01:43.170> work<00:01:43.470> which<00:01:43.680> gives<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.070> just

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
both of these work which gives you just

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
both of these work which gives you just
more<00:01:44.970> input<00:01:45.420> possibilities<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.290> makes<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
more input possibilities and makes the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.340 
more input possibilities and makes the
design<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:47.130> adaptable<00:01:47.930> okay<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:48.990> let's<00:01:49.229> get

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
design more adaptable okay so let's get

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
design more adaptable okay so let's get
started<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.040> build<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
started on how to build it it's the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.569 
started on how to build it it's the
simplest<00:01:51.840> thing<00:01:51.960> ever<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.619> need<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> place

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
simplest thing ever you need to place

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.240 
simplest thing ever you need to place
two<00:01:53.909> blocks<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.619> put<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> piece<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.040> redstone

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
two blocks down put a piece of redstone

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.319 
two blocks down put a piece of redstone
in<00:01:56.610> between<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> blocks<00:01:57.439> put<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> torch<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
in between the blocks put a torch on the

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.899 
in between the blocks put a torch on the
far<00:02:00.329> block<00:02:00.750> when<00:02:01.409> you're<00:02:01.560> facing<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.399> forward

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
far block when you're facing it forward

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.069 
far block when you're facing it forward
it's<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.770> far<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:05.969> block<00:02:06.329> so

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
it's going to be the far right block so

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
it's going to be the far right block so
just<00:02:07.259> put<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> torch<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.799> Block<00:02:08.330> next<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
just put a torch on the Block next to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.290 
just put a torch on the Block next to
that<00:02:09.720> block<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.500> want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.979> put<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.459> repeater<00:02:12.150> on

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
that block you want to put a repeater on

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
that block you want to put a repeater on
full<00:02:12.690> delay

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
full delay

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
full delay
and<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.280> front<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.730> block<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.060> doesn't

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and in front of this block that doesn't

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.030 
and in front of this block that doesn't
have<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> torch<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.230> you're<00:02:16.650> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> put<00:02:17.010> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
have a torch on it you're going to put a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.570 
have a torch on it you're going to put a
repeater<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:17.850> full<00:02:18.120> delay<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:20.190> are

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
repeater with full delay and you are

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.500 
repeater with full delay and you are
done

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
done

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.400 
done
so<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.440> plop<00:02:22.680> down<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.920> button<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
so just plop down a button and there you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.590 
so just plop down a button and there you
go<00:02:25.790> simple<00:02:26.790> T<00:02:27.090> flip-flop<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
go simple T flip-flop and I like this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.300 
go simple T flip-flop and I like this
design<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.500> gives<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.950> four

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
design because it gives you four

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
design because it gives you four
different<00:02:32.670> inputs<00:02:33.000> one<00:02:33.600> two<00:02:34.560> three<00:02:35.460> four<00:02:36.210> so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
different inputs one two three four so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.270 
different inputs one two three four so
that's<00:02:37.080> four<00:02:37.380> different<00:02:37.500> places<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.040> could

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that's four different places you could

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.230 
that's four different places you could
send<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.640> signal<00:02:39.030> into<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.940> work

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
send a signal into it and get it to work

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.610 
send a signal into it and get it to work
so<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.550> just<00:02:44.700> kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.150> short<00:02:45.360> little

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
so this is just kind of a short little

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.040 
so this is just kind of a short little
