took<00:05:06.960> your<00:05:07.200> advice<00:05:07.260> Deb<00:05:07.680> easy<00:05:08.010> I'm<00:05:08.280> doing<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.820> I

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
took your advice Deb easy I'm doing it I

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.750 
took your advice Deb easy I'm doing it I
don't<00:05:11.160> know<00:05:11.220> what<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.370> want<00:05:11.550> all<00:05:11.640> those<00:05:11.700> things

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
don't know what I want all those things

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.820 
don't know what I want all those things
but<00:05:12.030> that's<00:05:12.330> where<00:05:12.540> we're<00:05:12.720> going<00:05:13.080> now<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.620> I

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
but that's where we're going now so I

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.770 
but that's where we're going now so I
find<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.460> convenient<00:05:14.850> I<00:05:15.180> guess<00:05:15.450> maybe<00:05:15.630> you

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
find it convenient I guess maybe you

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.090 
find it convenient I guess maybe you
have<00:05:15.870> to<00:05:15.990> decide<00:05:16.260> how<00:05:16.470> long<00:05:16.500> someone<00:05:16.890> will

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
have to decide how long someone will

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.800 
have to decide how long someone will
really<00:05:17.280> take<00:05:17.580> your<00:05:17.760> card<00:05:18.000> but<00:05:18.390> then<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.690> might

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
really take your card but then you might

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.660 
really take your card but then you might
get<00:05:18.990> into<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.290> question<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.740> are<00:05:19.980> they<00:05:20.250> even
