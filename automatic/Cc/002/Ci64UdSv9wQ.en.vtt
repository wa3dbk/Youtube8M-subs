00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.780 
light because almost every color on this
painting<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.750> mixed<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.290> white<00:00:13.610> it's<00:00:14.610> a

yellow it's a lighter color I use the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.759 
yellow it's a lighter color I use the
light<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> foreground<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> use<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
light in the foreground so I use it

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
light in the foreground so I use it
again<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> background<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.660> added

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
again in the background I just added

00:00:33.899 --> 00:01:02.340 
again in the background I just added
some<00:00:34.050> white<00:00:34.350> let's<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.280> painting

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.310 

this<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.070> how<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.220> arranged<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.910> colors<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
this is how I arranged the colors to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.569 
this is how I arranged the colors to
darks<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:06.070> lights<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.960> mid-tones

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.859 

in<00:01:13.939> this<00:01:14.210> formula<00:01:14.840> we<00:01:14.990> use<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.619> more<00:01:15.649> Sienna

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
in this formula we use a bit more Sienna

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.719 
in this formula we use a bit more Sienna
Sienna<00:01:17.869> is<00:01:18.109> a<00:01:18.140> reddish<00:01:18.560> brown<00:01:18.590> kind<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.460> color

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
Sienna is a reddish brown kind of color

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.660 
Sienna is a reddish brown kind of color
and<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.899> makes<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.320> skin<00:01:21.679> tone<00:01:21.979> look<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.369> bit

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
and it makes the skin tone look a bit

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:32.130 
and it makes the skin tone look a bit
