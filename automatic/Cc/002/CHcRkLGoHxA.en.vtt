now<00:00:00.989> what<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.260> have<00:00:01.290> here<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:02.190> something<00:00:02.669> very

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
now what we have here is something very

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.420 
now what we have here is something very
very<00:00:03.149> awesome<00:00:03.449> indeed<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> digital

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
very awesome indeed this is a digital

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.549 
very awesome indeed this is a digital
designs<00:00:05.940> redline<00:00:06.870> series<00:00:08.120> 712<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:10.230> is

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
designs redline series 712 so this is

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.660 
designs redline series 712 so this is
the<00:00:11.420> second<00:00:12.420> largest<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.920> redline<00:00:14.219> series

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the second largest of the redline series

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730 
the second largest of the redline series
which<00:00:14.849> they<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.900> difference<00:00:16.289> between<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
which they do the difference between the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.580 
which they do the difference between the
redline<00:00:17.160> series<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.449> DD<00:00:18.869> series<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
redline series and the DD series and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769 
redline series and the DD series and
normal<00:00:19.890> USA<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.580> these<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.119> actually<00:00:21.539> put

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
normal USA so is these are actually put

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.529 
normal USA so is these are actually put
together<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.350> China<00:00:22.640> therefore<00:00:23.640> being<00:00:24.480> able

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
together in China therefore being able

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.920 
together in China therefore being able
to<00:00:24.689> reduce<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.380> cost<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> customer

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
to reduce the cost to the customer

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.080 
to reduce the cost to the customer
significantly<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.310> now<00:00:29.310> don't<00:00:29.580> let<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.789> for

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
significantly and now don't let that for

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.020 
significantly and now don't let that for
you<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.349> designs<00:00:31.650> won't<00:00:31.920> settle<00:00:32.279> for

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you do so designs won't settle for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.510 
you do so designs won't settle for
anything<00:00:33.690> other<00:00:34.020> than<00:00:34.200> top<00:00:34.649> quality<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.399> their

anything other than top quality in their

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
anything other than top quality in their
products<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.480> no<00:00:36.780> no<00:00:37.350> kind<00:00:37.620> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you have cooling vents again there it is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
you have cooling vents again there it is
really<00:01:26.100> nice<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> smooth<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.119> very<00:01:27.479> very

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
really nice and smooth it's very very

the the terminals are pushed terminals
rather<00:01:46.710> than<00:01:46.829> direct<00:01:47.189> leads<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.759> actually

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
rather than direct leads this actually

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.969 
rather than direct leads this actually
makes<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.600> easier<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
makes it a little bit easier for the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
makes it a little bit easier for the
user<00:01:50.340> who's<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:51.090> buying<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> whack<00:01:52.049> in

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
user who's just buying these to whack in

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.510 
user who's just buying these to whack in
their<00:01:52.350> daily<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.159> kind<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
their daily you know it's kind of the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.630 
their daily you know it's kind of the
redline<00:01:53.820> series<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:54.570> aimed<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.770> wider

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
redline series is more aimed at a wider

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
redline series is more aimed at a wider
kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> audience<00:01:57.420> than<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> DD<00:01:58.049> range<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
kind of audience than the DD range and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.469 
kind of audience than the DD range and
so<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.280> makes<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.759> little<00:01:59.850> easier<00:02:00.299> for

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so that makes it a little easier for

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
so that makes it a little easier for
wiring<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:01.049> there<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> good<00:02:01.829> high<00:02:02.070> quality

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
wiring up there are a good high quality
