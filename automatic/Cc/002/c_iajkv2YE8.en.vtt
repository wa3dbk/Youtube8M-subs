00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
on my left hand hand side I have a n97

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.450 
on my left hand hand side I have a n97
one<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.580> 97<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:13.230> key<00:00:13.679> usability

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
one here is in 97 to the key usability

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.230 
one here is in 97 to the key usability
enhancement<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.199> 97<00:00:16.890> too<00:00:17.850> we

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
enhancement we have is that in 97 too we

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.870 
enhancement we have is that in 97 too we
are<00:00:18.690> introducing<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> kinetic<00:00:20.160> scrolling<00:00:20.430> so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
are introducing a kinetic scrolling so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.410 
are introducing a kinetic scrolling so
that<00:00:21.539> allows<00:00:21.900> us<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:23.090> scroll<00:00:24.740> very<00:00:25.740> smoothly

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
that allows us to scroll very smoothly

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
that allows us to scroll very smoothly
all<00:00:27.420> kinds<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> items<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.560> look<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.800> from

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
all kinds of items if you look at from

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.280 
all kinds of items if you look at from
the<00:00:29.330> 120<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:31.170> doesn't<00:00:31.500> scroll<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
the 120 it doesn't scroll so you have to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
the 120 it doesn't scroll so you have to
take<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> scroll<00:00:35.399> bar<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.700> order<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
take into the scroll bar in order to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.790 
take into the scroll bar in order to
move<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.719> kinetic<00:00:37.170> scrolling<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
move this kinetic scrolling is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.310 
move this kinetic scrolling is
introduced<00:00:38.460> everywhere<00:00:39.000> we're<00:00:39.719> scrolling<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
introduced everywhere we're scrolling is

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.029 
introduced everywhere we're scrolling is
involved<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.040> music<00:00:41.460> photos<00:00:45.410> application<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
involved so music photos application to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.730 
involved so music photos application to
it<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.750> do<00:00:51.960> scrolling<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> is

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 
it we can just do scrolling so this is

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.600 
it we can just do scrolling so this is
very<00:00:55.400> handy<00:00:56.800> also<00:00:57.800> in<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.040> application

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
very handy also in the application

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.450 
very handy also in the application

so lots of kind of conventional error
Corrections<00:01:37.760> for<00:01:37.940> improving<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.600> stability

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
Corrections for improving the stability

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.630 
Corrections for improving the stability
performance<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:42.190> then<00:01:43.190> also<00:01:43.400> we

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
performance and so on and then also we

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.450 
performance and so on and then also we
have<00:01:43.790> kind<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:45.010> improved<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.190> memory

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
have kind of improved the memory

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.880 
have kind of improved the memory
configuration<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.500> amount<00:01:48.740> of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
configuration so that the the amount of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.100 
configuration so that the the amount of
the<00:01:49.160> free<00:01:49.790> phone<00:01:50.150> internal<00:01:50.600> memory<00:01:50.900> has

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
the free phone internal memory has

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.160 
the free phone internal memory has
increased<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.460> that<00:01:52.660> well<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.780> current

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
increased so that well the current

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.350 
increased so that well the current
estimate<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:55.010> there<00:01:55.310> between<00:01:55.520> 25

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
estimate is that it's there between 25

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.779 
estimate is that it's there between 25
to<00:01:56.390> 30<00:01:57.380> megabytes<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.070> don't<00:01:58.250> know<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.490> exact

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
to 30 megabytes I don't know the exact

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.930 
to 30 megabytes I don't know the exact
figure<00:01:59.030> yet<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.390> h3<00:01:59.750> increase<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.820> has

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
figure yet so h3 increase so that has

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.639 
figure yet so h3 increase so that has
been<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.179> one<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.600> kind<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.170> area<00:02:03.410> we<00:02:03.530> have

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
been a one of a kind of the area we have

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.740 
been a one of a kind of the area we have
photo<00:02:03.890> lots<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.250> feedback<00:02:04.399> that<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.970> amount

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
photo lots of feedback that the amount

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.230 
photo lots of feedback that the amount
