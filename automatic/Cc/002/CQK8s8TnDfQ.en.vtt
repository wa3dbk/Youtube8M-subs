00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
helps I think the hitches are one of my

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.380 
helps I think the hitches are one of my
key<00:04:57.230> routes<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.700> even<00:04:58.940> if<00:04:59.000> they<00:04:59.090> do<00:04:59.150> get

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
key routes and even if they do get

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.870 
key routes and even if they do get
pressed<00:04:59.630> out<00:04:59.780> still<00:05:00.110> work<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.530> still<00:05:00.830> work<00:05:01.070> so

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
pressed out still work and still work so

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.550
