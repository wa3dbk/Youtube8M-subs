further sort of video i guess to explain
my<00:00:27.960> thoughts<00:00:28.169> more<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.860> so<00:00:29.669> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.000> fall

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
my thoughts more and so this is fall

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
my thoughts more and so this is fall
from<00:00:30.480> eminem's<00:00:30.960> new<00:00:31.079> survival<00:00:31.829> music<00:00:32.220> video

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
from eminem's new survival music video

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
from eminem's new survival music video
and<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.960> survival<00:00:34.470> is<00:00:34.620> revealed

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and as we know that survival is revealed

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.450 
and as we know that survival is revealed
with<00:00:35.160> ghosts<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.820> ghost<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.450> his<00:00:36.719> video<00:00:37.460> so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
with ghosts and ghost is in his video so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.610 
with ghosts and ghost is in his video so
there's<00:00:39.360> sort<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.960> big<00:00:40.110> connection<00:00:40.380> there

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there's sort of a big connection there

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.710 
there's sort of a big connection there
and<00:00:40.920> there's<00:00:41.130> things<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.000> apply<00:00:42.240> to<00:00:42.330> eminem

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720

and there's things that apply to eminem
like<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.140> cabin<00:00:43.560> that<00:00:43.710> apply<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> his

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
like this cabin that apply to his

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.730 
like this cabin that apply to his
personal<00:00:44.640> life<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.000> his<00:00:45.180> story<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
personal life and his story that you

personal life and his story that you
don't<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.130> think<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.090> call

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
don't really think have to do with call

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.030 
don't really think have to do with call
of<00:00:48.330> duty<00:00:48.510> ghosts<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.380> if<00:00:49.560> you<00:00:49.650> look<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
of duty ghosts but if you look at the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.980 
of duty ghosts but if you look at the
leaked<00:00:50.220> achievements<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:50.790> example<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
leaked achievements for example one of

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.560 
leaked achievements for example one of
the<00:00:52.140> locations<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.460> cabin<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.180> extinction

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the locations is a cabin and extinction

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
the locations is a cabin and extinction
and<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.980> looks<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.579> dreary

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and this kind of looks like a dreary

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.060 
and this kind of looks like a dreary
rundown<00:00:57.600> nighttime<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.950> you're

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
rundown nighttime as you can see you're

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.910 
rundown nighttime as you can see you're
here<00:00:59.220> it's<00:00:59.400> all<00:00:59.550> rubble<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> destroyed<00:01:00.540> a

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
here it's all rubble and destroyed a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.860 
here it's all rubble and destroyed a
cabin<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> woods<00:01:02.310> that's<00:01:03.180> sort<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.630> like

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
cabin in the woods that's sort of like

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
cabin in the woods that's sort of like
you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.530> alien<00:01:05.220> apocalypse<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.060> think

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you know alien apocalypse and i think

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
you know alien apocalypse and i think
that's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.810> fitting<00:01:07.350> setting<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:08.100> this

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that's a very fitting setting for this

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.460 
that's a very fitting setting for this
likewise<00:01:09.149> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> next<00:01:09.990> picture<00:01:10.110> i'm<00:01:10.350> going

to show you guys which is going to be of
the<00:01:11.820> city<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.979> eminem's<00:01:13.979> new<00:01:14.100> music<00:01:14.580> video

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the city in eminem's new music video

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.320 
the city in eminem's new music video
there's<00:01:15.450> also<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.900> city<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.710> his<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:18.120> leaked

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there's also a city in his in the leaked

there's also a city in his in the leaked
achievements<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.900> extinction<00:01:19.350> mode<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.190> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
achievements for extinction mode so that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
achievements for extinction mode so that
just<00:01:20.580> leads<00:01:20.729> me<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> believe<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.570> are

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just leads me to believe that these are

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.800 
just leads me to believe that these are
sort<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.050> like<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.830> real<00:01:23.430> teasers<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.600> like

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
sort of like not real teasers but like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.890 
sort of like not real teasers but like
just<00:01:25.170> hints<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.540> what's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
just hints you know like this is what's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.840 
just hints you know like this is what's
happening<00:01:27.990> look<00:01:28.650> there's<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.310> mean<00:01:29.580> it's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
happening look there's the I mean it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
happening look there's the I mean it's
clearly<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.229> totally<00:01:31.890> destroyed<00:01:32.220> but

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
clearly not like totally destroyed but

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.770 
clearly not like totally destroyed but
it's<00:01:32.580> night<00:01:32.790> people<00:01:33.120> are<00:01:33.299> gathering<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it's night people are gathering on the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's night people are gathering on the
roof<00:01:34.020> maybe<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.710> an<00:01:34.830> extraction

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
roof maybe that's like an extraction

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.039 
roof maybe that's like an extraction
point<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> make<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.270> city<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.630> climb<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
point you make it the city you climb to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.149 
point you make it the city you climb to
the<00:01:37.080> top<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> roof<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.010> that

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the top of the roof you get on that

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.550 
the top of the roof you get on that
extraction<00:01:38.610> helicopter<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.840> fly<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.350> out

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
extraction helicopter and you fly on out

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
extraction helicopter and you fly on out
that's<00:01:41.040> certainly<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.610> possibility<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that's certainly a possibility and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
that's certainly a possibility and
extinction<00:01:42.930> mode<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.440> like<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:44.970> all

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
extinction mode and like you can see all

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.850 
extinction mode and like you can see all
