this but at least at least it's going to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.809 
this but at least at least it's going to
get<00:03:38.620> some<00:03:38.829> harassment<00:03:39.040> done<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.609> twelve

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
get some harassment done the twelve

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.879 
get some harassment done the twelve
o'clock<00:03:40.060> position<00:03:40.510> babies<00:03:41.410> gotten<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.680> lot<00:03:41.829> of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
harassment and done it had done and it

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.289 
harassment and done it had done and it
might<00:03:43.630> be<00:03:43.810> enough<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.220> even<00:03:45.220> out<00:03:45.579> this<00:03:45.790> loss<00:03:46.060> of

might be enough to even out this loss of

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.879 
might be enough to even out this loss of
it<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.930> think<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.200> baby<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.470> taking<00:03:47.799> the
