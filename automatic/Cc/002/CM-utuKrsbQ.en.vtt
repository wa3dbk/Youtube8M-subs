00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:08.320
 Hello everyone, I have already installed a windmill 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:14.230
 it turns out to be my mother that 1 of 2 here 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.960
 Between the point wi-fi turned out to fit 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.819
 almost that is there is the only thing with 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.890
 cutting 

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:23.769
 there were burrs inside the pipe I let go 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 All this straightened flat screwdriver so 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:30.119
 how it is welded from two halves knocked out 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.119
 extra 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.730
 directional steel don't remember how 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.609
 called and here don't look at what u 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.250
 dirty was completely clean but 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:45.910
 while I'm wearing gloves with a rusty pipe all this 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:50.379
 case one fought the whole thing secured 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.829
 he has become a little of that color 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.699
 the funny thing is at an angle 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:01.659
 it is a miracle that tries to rotate and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.469
 now almost no wind 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 interesting 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:14.159
 our simple winter time my flashlight 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 shine 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.180
 he started already spinning he is already trying a 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.090
 if you turn towards the wind then he 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.890
 even the breeze seems to be starting to spin 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.299
 that is, there is no wind on earth 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.149
 here it rotates about what is current through the wires 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.470
 preform I connected them in the pipe prokinul 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.690
 also had to cut in the cold 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.180
 and throw it from top to bottom because 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:55.280
 from the bottom up I could not stretch the issue 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 mast length over 6 meters with kopecks 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 here it is there from ends welded 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.210
 here participation in the center where the wire 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.130
 rested damn I'm pleased with the only 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.340
 I found out that I was off the ramp 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.240
 there moments she's weakened now i'm from below 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.760
 I'll show you how this whole thing looks like. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.209
 guys i'm satisfied and i'm home 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.810
 came even looked spark there now 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:36.810
 let's see how it will work 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:42.920
 right here I got a little better from roofs 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.920
 Slazil he here is right well yayaril 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.470
 slippery roof scary 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.520
 here's a sunny one who is interested in winter 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.280
 the period from the back is all snow 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.380
 littered one if you look closely 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.470
 the gap between the snow and the sun 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.470
 there is so no heat and the snow is melting 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.440
 here you can equip a room 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.030
 a bunch of extra wires for this second 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:31.420
 wind turbine had to pull included. 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:38.940
 his match is like that now 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:42.390
 I will fix the match so I set exactly 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.549
 the wind from below almost does not feel at all 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.720
 not felt it is plainly visible 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.720
 on the video that he plays 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.579
 here it is this cable 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.060
 which I hang from strong 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.780
 gusts can be clearly seen as he shakes a pony 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.160
 mm x 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:11.410
 frozen hands it's all fine 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:15.549
 noticeable, that is, a sound is heard 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.530
 working generator paired brake by the way 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:22.840
 heard that is when we short three 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:30.740
 phases hear the hum of the generator when it 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:33.979
 trying to stop the video 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.250
 and started now I have it all 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:40.520
 business will be pulled a little further already 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:46.030
 video tests for this I will ask 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.030
 Thank you all for your attention. Good luck.
