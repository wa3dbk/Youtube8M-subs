00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
to remember is to be sure to use a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.349 
to remember is to be sure to use a
stitch<00:00:27.109> that's<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:28.070> same<00:00:28.279> on<00:00:28.490> both<00:00:28.670> sides

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
stitch that's the same on both sides

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.599 
stitch that's the same on both sides
I<00:00:29.390> used<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.929> garter<00:00:30.259> stitch<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.099> reason<00:00:31.460> for

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
I used a garter stitch the reason for

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.810 
I used a garter stitch the reason for
that<00:00:31.759> is<00:00:32.029> that<00:00:32.060> it<00:00:32.480> is<00:00:32.660> going<00:00:32.990> to<00:00:33.200> twist<00:00:33.820> when

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
that is that it is going to twist when

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.910 
that is that it is going to twist when
you<00:00:34.970> bind<00:00:35.330> off<00:00:35.660> after<00:00:36.230> you've<00:00:36.350> gotten<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
you bind off after you've gotten the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.130 
you bind off after you've gotten the
scarf<00:00:37.219> as<00:00:37.430> long<00:00:37.640> as<00:00:37.789> you<00:00:37.879> want<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:38.270> make<00:00:38.840> sure

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
scarf as long as you want it make sure

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.410 
scarf as long as you want it make sure
that<00:00:39.410> you're<00:00:39.590> bound<00:00:39.920> off<00:00:40.190> tail<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:40.969> on<00:00:41.270> the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
that you're bound off tail is on the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.069 
that you're bound off tail is on the
same<00:00:41.750> end<00:00:42.140> as<00:00:42.469> the<00:00:43.399> tail<00:00:43.670> where<00:00:44.329> you<00:00:44.570> started

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
same end as the tail where you started

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.100 
same end as the tail where you started
so<00:00:45.260> both<00:00:46.070> tails<00:00:46.579> are<00:00:46.940> on<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.210> same<00:00:47.449> end<00:00:47.750> that's

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
so both tails are on the same end that's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.760 
so both tails are on the same end that's
very<00:00:48.469> important<00:00:49.960> then<00:00:50.960> you're<00:00:51.199> going<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.559> take
