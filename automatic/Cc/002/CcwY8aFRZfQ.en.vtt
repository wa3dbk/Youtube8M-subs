 well a genius is not reinventing I'm under 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.250

 it's brown when it was good environment 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.219
 but that sense is also lived 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.320
 impotent when you score a goal 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.180

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.890
 locks then trained day to 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.329
 day to be better if lethal 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.609
 coaches who do not do it well 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.710
 match a final I'll bet they tell me 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.999
 to the worst tracks and others that are hallucinate 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.589

 sacks the taco finishes you touch penalties of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.149
 side the party is the crappy but not 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.649

 I do not stop fighting until this does not 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.340
 ends and the match does not end until 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.850

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.950
 individual each match is a final if 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.420
 it comes out badly and the new account does not say 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.640
 that you do not die without having done the test 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.190

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.410
 makes them stay at four and 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.209

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.350
 I have also lived feeling helpless 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.180
 when you score a goal celebrating 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.950
 front wide for locks to 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.810
 then entering day by day to 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.280
 be able to be better if the coach shouts 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.380
 is that you do not do it well 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.000
 a final I will show my level to 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.319
 worse tracks and others that are translucent 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.910
 in playing games with flights that do not 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.440

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.750
 this does not end and the game is not over 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.200
 until you hear the horn as picture 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.800
 individual each match is a final if 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.510

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.010
 where he thinks writing, he fucks me 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.570
 I knew I was a martyr now that you 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.289
 I count this many will think that I lie 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.999

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.740
 remove as individual box each 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.389
 match is a final if it goes wrong so 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.249
 no new accounts do not say it's not cool 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.189
