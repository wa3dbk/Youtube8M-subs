00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.820
 then you made such a tv 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:00.120
 so with zumba I stuck on it 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.680
 then here is a skateboard like this 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.680
 to implement a fall 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.580
 lamp that can do but that works 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.580
 Not 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:31.579
 So that's what she looks like when she does 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:37.350
 everything you can not do it now 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:43.380
 Well, I'll make you more short 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:57.119
 look at the wardrobe 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:02:00.049
 on the other hand keeps pockets in there then I have 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.110
 here so all this to the carton 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.459
 then I have the DIY 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:36.330
 the terrarium of a kind made because they 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:42.180
 So it has the hand and then it is here 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:47.489
 to enter such a guest 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:54.150
 of it is still a door the pensioner 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:58.470
 now not a door proves so again 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.550
 open up here so the whole thing 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.550
 I made a lot of things 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.110
 then there is still such a customer then is 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.390
 But this is about it 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.950
 a little bit that hangs down because we 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.409
 whenever I go to the festival that 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.620
 That's why we stop that 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:22.400
 little bit off then here is the whole 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.620
 So it's a carpet here 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:34.319

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.650
 And then I still have sinks here 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.070
