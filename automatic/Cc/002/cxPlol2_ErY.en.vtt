 the express summit he had simply 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.360
 Why 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.040
 nv what trends and the timing 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.660
 good evening but how good are you 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.600
 lose everything 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.850
 it is true that it is then you who 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.220
 have your first morning ep a very 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.260
 great success he was certified disc of 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.850
 platinum that I have very quickly for you 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.530
 that's exactly what you want 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.530
 all the academicians here tonight 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.940
 yes if I had something then say the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.650
 top of my little experience 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.910
 these voices there to paraphrase a 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.680
 artist we talk a lot about 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.990
 moment a great artist who said that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.550
 with his guitar in his hand and the fear of 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.140
 nothing and I believe that's true in this 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.060
 craft everything is possible with a 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.620
 guitar with a microphone we can realize 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.990
 many, many of his childhood dreams 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.460
 so here you hang on to your dreams 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.410
 do what you like you do it 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.730
 so well done I spent we note 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.410
 so if dwan and daniel 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.300
 they are two voices and two 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.130
 totally different personalities 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.530
 how did you find these two duets 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.330
 precisely these two songs that have a 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.560
 kind of common point in the turn of 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.080
 guitar but which melodically are 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.720
 radically different and I find 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.580
 that both came out what is 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.080
 interestingly it is that here is the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.240
 time of a duet the song is revisited 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.740
 lé recut into a duo here 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.090
 I've been singing for two years 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.670
 the clock turns alone I was finally 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.920
 glad to be able to share it with 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.180
 a singer and life simply I 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.680
 find that you have sublime you and my 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.100
 new song so thank you 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.100
 here 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.420
 other consequence than juliette solal 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.120
 design the care then what are you 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.620
 have thought it was benefit then 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.620
 first night in Cairo 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.220
 in the heel 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.540
 your coach omnium so I said no 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.650
 evening to everyone and good evening a 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.980
 mechanism good evening you are beautiful 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.840
 more issue to mercy that's nice so 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.310
 I will talk about sidoine I am very 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.520
 happy tonight because I have 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.380
 heard if dwan your spoken voice sung 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.810
 your stamp and what stood out 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.460
 from that of michael elsewhere since 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.930
 when we sing a song like that that 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.790
 you who come closer to you as 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.130
 the folk of pop in French that you 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.530
 looks and threw it well felt in 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.669
 tone your element in any case just a 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.669
 little thing that gives because me 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.320
 photo I use a trick not nice tone 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.810
 microphone when he moved to take it to 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.340
 the hand and but the loan of your mouth 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.530
 he was a little too low here but 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.650
 listen in any case here are his good 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.840
 benefits and get in the habit 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.820
 daniel still beats the same daniel I 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.229
 found that he was completely 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.610
 relaxed in bed all was well 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.350
 the smallest qu sidoine is normal 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.910
 micro arrived at the right level 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.440
 because they were amateurish 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.950
 of art yes that's why I say it but 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.500
 it is not mean 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.240
 go back good night and we 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.390
 birthday good score but also 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.390
 a lot 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.400
 now michael actually it's 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.510
 it's a song that may seem 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.860
 sometimes a bit soft but the line 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.380
 melodic ask to have a 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.640
 accuracy and accuracy because the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.870
 song is so sober in the 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.300
 arrangements she actually has 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.720
 need to be extremely precise and I 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.460
 did not find 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.100
 I did not always find you very precise 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.150
 customs on the accuracy of huge nipples 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.660
 but I find I did not find very 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.800
 very precise daniel for me the head a 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.780
 racing car when you're in full 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.130
 speed you make tubes beat them 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.440
 incredible records and when we're at 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.570
 slowed down we know exactly how to appreciate 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.250
 all the comfort of your velvet voice 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:14.120
 I loved once again thanks to all 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.120
 thank you thank you it's a great pleasure
