00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
not simultaneously one at a time now the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.349 
not simultaneously one at a time now the
thing<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.109> me<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.640> believe<00:00:20.640> that's<00:00:20.850> been

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
thing for me is I believe that's been

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.380 
thing for me is I believe that's been
scientifically<00:00:22.109> proven<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.029> rind

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
scientifically proven that the the rind

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.550 
scientifically proven that the the rind
is<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.680> most<00:00:26.029> nutritious<00:00:27.029> part<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.320> fruit

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is the most nutritious part of the fruit

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.510 
is the most nutritious part of the fruit
so<00:00:30.019> that's<00:00:31.019> great<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.830> those<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.189> us<00:00:32.309> only

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so that's great for those of us only

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.920 
so that's great for those of us only
have<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:32.820> hand<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.239> typically<00:00:33.809> I'll

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
have one hand because typically I'll

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620 
have one hand because typically I'll
just<00:00:34.110> eat<00:00:34.260> an<00:00:34.380> orange<00:00:34.910> like<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.090> apple

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
much the same way I usually just eat

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.319 
much the same way I usually just eat
like<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> cob<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> corn<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.850> let's<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> big

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
like a cob of corn so let's take a big

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.670 
like a cob of corn so let's take a big
ol<00:01:03.480> bite<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> middle<00:01:04.229> just

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.649 
my chest we'll just peel it down the
only<00:02:02.459> problem<00:02:02.789> with<00:02:02.879> this<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.239> that<00:02:03.270> sometimes

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
only problem with this is that sometimes

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.410 
only problem with this is that sometimes
the<00:02:04.319> banana<00:02:04.679> stuff<00:02:05.039> does<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.909> off<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.270> your

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the banana stuff does get off on your

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.039 
the banana stuff does get off on your
shirt<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> that's<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.220> bummer<00:02:09.049> but

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
shirt so that's kind of a bummer but

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.599 
shirt so that's kind of a bummer but
it's<00:02:10.200> totally<00:02:10.379> yummy<00:02:11.720> now<00:02:12.720> oranges<00:02:13.489> what<00:02:14.489> I'll

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
it's totally yummy now oranges what I'll

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.800 
it's totally yummy now oranges what I'll
do<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.049> loosen<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.530> up<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.859> I<00:02:17.760> guess<00:02:18.329> it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
do I like to loosen it up and I guess it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.089 
do I like to loosen it up and I guess it
doesn't<00:02:19.019> matter<00:02:19.200> how<00:02:19.380> many<00:02:19.440> hands<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:19.950> have

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
doesn't matter how many hands you have

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.949 
doesn't matter how many hands you have
this<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.370> probably<00:02:20.609> a<00:02:20.670> good<00:02:20.760> idea<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.870> I'll

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
this is probably a good idea so I'll

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.410 
this is probably a good idea so I'll
just<00:02:22.109> roll<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.410> around<00:02:22.760> try<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.819> loosen<00:02:24.239> up<00:02:24.359> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
just roll it around try to loosen up the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.819 
just roll it around try to loosen up the
skin<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> little<00:02:24.959> bit<00:02:29.060> then<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> lot<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.269> times<00:02:30.829> if

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
skin a little bit then a lot of times if

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.210 
skin a little bit then a lot of times if
I'm<00:02:32.010> at<00:02:32.190> work<00:02:32.720> I'll<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:34.019> have<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> plastic

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
things I've never had one in my entire

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.479 
things I've never had one in my entire
life<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.239> don't<00:02:42.569> know<00:02:42.780> why<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.739> have<00:02:43.769> usually

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
life I don't know why but I have usually

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.009 
life I don't know why but I have usually
I'll<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.940> use<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> knife<00:02:46.130> pretty<00:02:47.130> funny<00:02:47.400> huh

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
I'll just use a knife pretty funny huh

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:59.350 
I'll just use a knife pretty funny huh
and<00:02:49.019> now<00:02:49.169> I'll<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.290> score<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:51.870> this

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.140 

like<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.890> probably<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.520> weirdest<00:03:04.970> way

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
like that is probably the weirdest way

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.700 
like that is probably the weirdest way
you<00:03:05.210> can<00:03:05.360> do<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.660> but<00:03:05.900> whatever<00:03:06.080> it's<00:03:06.530> how<00:03:06.680> I

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
you can do this but whatever it's how I

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.940 
you can do this but whatever it's how I
do<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:08.450> works<00:03:08.690> for<00:03:08.990> me<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:09.440> that's<00:03:09.830> the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
do it and it works for me and that's the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:28.000 
do it and it works for me and that's the
key<00:03:10.220> right<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:13.040> then<00:03:13.780> just<00:03:14.780> gonna<00:03:15.050> peel<00:03:15.470> away

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.430 

not<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:29.379> least<00:03:30.379> messy<00:03:31.129> thing<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.640> do<00:03:32.260> but<00:03:33.260> hey

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440

not the least messy thing to do but hey
it<00:03:33.560> smells<00:03:33.680> good<00:03:34.129> so<00:03:35.060> that's<00:03:35.209> awesome

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090
