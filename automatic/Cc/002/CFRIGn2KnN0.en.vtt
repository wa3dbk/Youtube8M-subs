stuff<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:16.710> look<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.190> gonna

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
stuff now if we look at it I'm gonna

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.530 
stuff now if we look at it I'm gonna
break<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> down<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:17.910> I'm<00:02:17.970> gonna<00:02:18.090> open<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.480> up

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
break it down here I'm gonna open it up

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.670 
break it down here I'm gonna open it up
from<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> inside<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.320> show<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> what

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
from the inside out and show you what

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
from the inside out and show you what
the<00:02:19.770> dry<00:02:19.980> pack<00:02:20.220> component<00:02:20.730> looks<00:02:20.850> like<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.450> now

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the dry pack component looks like so now

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.030 
the dry pack component looks like so now
I've<00:02:21.660> unstuffed<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.350> here<00:02:22.500> let's<00:02:22.710> break<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
I've unstuffed it here let's break it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.020 
I've unstuffed it here let's break it
down<00:02:23.070> from<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.400> inside<00:02:23.640> out<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.910> it's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
down from the inside out and it's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.190 
down from the inside out and it's
typically<00:02:24.300> gonna<00:02:24.450> function<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:25.050> you'd

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
typically gonna function like you'd

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.810 
typically gonna function like you'd
expect<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.710> dry<00:02:25.890> bag<00:02:26.100> or<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> dry<00:02:26.460> pack<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
expect from a dry bag or a dry pack the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.640 
expect from a dry bag or a dry pack the
waterproofing<00:02:27.360> comes<00:02:27.570> from<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> roll<00:02:28.080> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
waterproofing comes from the roll to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.020 
waterproofing comes from the roll to
rolls<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.100> you're<00:02:29.190> typically<00:02:29.490> able<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> clip

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
rolls and you're typically able to clip

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.480 
rolls and you're typically able to clip
right<00:02:30.240> down<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.840> open<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.440> will<00:02:31.650> note<00:02:31.860> one

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
right down we open it up I will note one

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.530 
right down we open it up I will note one
of<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.640> things<00:02:32.790> you're<00:02:32.880> gonna<00:02:32.940> notice<00:02:33.150> right
