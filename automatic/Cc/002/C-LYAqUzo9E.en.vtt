00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.020 
or when it's going to be added to
playstation<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.659> xbox<00:01:43.549> but<00:01:44.549> hopefully<00:01:45.000> soon

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
playstation and xbox but hopefully soon

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.999 
playstation and xbox but hopefully soon
i<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.710> say<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
i think they first of all say and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
i think they first of all say and
they're<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.490> five<00:01:48.360> our<00:01:48.570> prestigious

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
they're going to do five our prestigious

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.789 
they're going to do five our prestigious
so<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.350> i<00:01:49.409> take<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> 15<00:01:50.070> total<00:01:51.409> with<00:01:52.409> scope

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so that i take up to 15 total with scope

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.899 
so that i take up to 15 total with scope
to<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> 20<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.579> bit<00:01:56.700> mental

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to go to 20 so that's a bit mental

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
to go to 20 so that's a bit mental
another<00:01:57.420> 10<00:01:57.659> print<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.079> doubling<00:01:58.590> what

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
another 10 print that's doubling what

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
another 10 print that's doubling what
I've<00:01:59.100> done<00:01:59.219> now<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.090> will<00:02:00.270> honestly

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I've done now and but I will honestly

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.370 
I've done now and but I will honestly
look<00:02:00.719> forward<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.490> for<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
look forward to that and for one of the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.520 
look forward to that and for one of the
prestigious<00:02:04.380> probably<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:05.579> I'm

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
prestigious probably when I'm

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.949 
prestigious probably when I'm
going<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.610> 15th<00:02:07.940> prestige<00:02:08.119> or<00:02:08.450> when<00:02:08.750> I'm<00:02:08.869> in

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
going to 15th prestige or when I'm in

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.930 
going to 15th prestige or when I'm in
15th<00:02:09.410> prestige<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.920> will<00:02:10.069> try<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.340> do<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:10.580> road

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
15th prestige I will try and do it road

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.230 
15th prestige I will try and do it road
to<00:02:11.270> whatever<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.530> I'll<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.550> road<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.940> level

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
to whatever so I'll do a road to level

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.699 
to whatever so I'll do a road to level
80<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.690> that'll<00:02:14.990> probably<00:02:15.170> be<00:02:15.290> showing<00:02:15.560> you

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
80 so that'll probably be showing you

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.190 
80 so that'll probably be showing you
every<00:02:16.400> game<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.819> played<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.990> guys

five pills left and sponsorship place

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.920 
five pills left and sponsorship place
and<00:02:48.019> I'd<00:02:48.080> die<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:49.310> go<00:02:49.459> 0<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:50.030> 1<00:02:50.209> or<00:02:50.239> 1<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.810> 2

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
and I'd die and like go 0 to 1 or 1 to 2

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.420 
and I'd die and like go 0 to 1 or 1 to 2
or<00:02:50.959> something<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.560> spark<00:02:51.890> like<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.220> only

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
or something that spark like the only

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.059 
or something that spark like the only
time<00:02:52.640> I'll<00:02:52.970> go<00:02:53.090> negative<00:02:53.709> yeah<00:02:54.709> most<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
time I'll go negative yeah most of the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.430 
time I'll go negative yeah most of the
time<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.720> generally<00:02:56.720> stay<00:02:56.870> positive<00:02:57.080> and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
time I generally stay positive and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.040 
time I generally stay positive and
that's<00:02:57.890> why<00:02:57.980> my<00:02:58.130> KD<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.640> shooting<00:02:59.600> up<00:02:59.690> as<00:02:59.900> well

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
that's why my KD is shooting up as well

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.540 
that's why my KD is shooting up as well
although<00:03:00.290> cross<00:03:00.920> I've<00:03:01.040> had<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.250> nearly

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
although cross I've had like nearly

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.699 
although cross I've had like nearly
80,000<00:03:02.239> kills<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.540> think<00:03:02.780> now<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.440> obviously

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
80,000 kills I think now it obviously

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.610 
80,000 kills I think now it obviously
takes<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:04.040> lot<00:03:04.250> longer<00:03:04.370> for<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.730> KD<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.180> go<00:03:05.330> up

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
takes a lot longer for the KD to go up

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.930 
takes a lot longer for the KD to go up
but<00:03:06.620> it'll<00:03:06.950> soon<00:03:07.190> be<00:03:07.220> at<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.430> level<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.730> I'm

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
but it'll soon be at a level that I'm

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.059 
but it'll soon be at a level that I'm
really<00:03:08.450> really<00:03:08.690> happy<00:03:08.840> with<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.350> yeah<00:03:09.890> really

worked my ass off to get those because

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080 
worked my ass off to get those because

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.949 
some of them ie the shotguns I've got
most<00:03:23.329> of<00:03:23.450> them<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:23.750> gold<00:03:24.019> now<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:25.160> KSG<00:03:25.489> i<00:03:26.060> think

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
most of them in gold now the KSG i think

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.600 
most of them in gold now the KSG i think
is<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.560> only<00:03:27.739> one<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.010> I've<00:03:28.160> not<00:03:28.400> gotten

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.170 
is the only one that I've not gotten
gold<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.120> that's<00:03:29.299> level<00:03:29.840> 30<00:03:30.549> nearly<00:03:31.549> level<00:03:31.790> 31

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
gold and that's level 30 nearly level 31

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.340 
gold and that's level 30 nearly level 31
