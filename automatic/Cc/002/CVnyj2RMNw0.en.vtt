 like my facebook page already 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.240
 knowing this tunes your guitar and we're going 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.240
 to start 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.800
 the standard tuning for our 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.949
 guitar for this song we will use 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.000
 the following chords for sharp 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.590
 minor the greatest 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.010
 my greatest 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.260
 D major 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.120
 D minor and if minor use for this 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.079
 song would be the next three hits 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.060
 down 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.810

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.210
 yes 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.210
 2 up on the highest strings 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.190
 and one down the ropes more 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.190
 sharp 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.660
 that the order of the notes for this 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.660
 song would be as follows 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.430
 yes 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.770
 and 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.550
 do not 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.290
 minutes 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.420

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.440
 Y 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.840
 to 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.050
 and here we will repeat what was agreed this 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.720
 song is very repetitive and repeats 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.459
 many times the chorus then it would be 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.770

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.300
