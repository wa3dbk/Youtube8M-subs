00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this is a really simplistic game it's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
this is a really simplistic game it's
got<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.420> similar<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.229> gameplay<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
got a very similar kind of gameplay to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
got a very similar kind of gameplay to
flappy<00:01:44.520> birds<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> different

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
flappy birds but it's got a different

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
flappy birds but it's got a different
style<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> gameplay<00:01:46.860> you're<00:01:47.579> basically<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
style of gameplay you're basically a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
style of gameplay you're basically a
thief<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> you're<00:01:48.930> trying<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> run<00:01:49.409> away<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
thief and you're trying to run away you

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.230 
thief and you're trying to run away you
have<00:01:50.220> different<00:01:50.579> blocks<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
have different blocks that you have to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
have different blocks that you have to
jump<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> double<00:01:52.770> tap<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> do

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
jump to and you can double tap to do

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950 
jump to and you can double tap to do
front<00:01:53.759> flips<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> jump<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.780> higher

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
front flips and jump a little bit higher

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
front flips and jump a little bit higher
but<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.280> challenging<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.030> found

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
but it is really challenging and I found

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
but it is really challenging and I found
myself<00:01:57.329> getting<00:01:57.750> engrossed<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.560> because

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
myself getting engrossed in this because

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.859 
myself getting engrossed in this because
you<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.700> better<00:01:59.880> each<00:02:00.210> time<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you just want to do better each time and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.240 
you just want to do better each time and
it<00:02:01.170> definitely<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.159> most

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it definitely is one of the most

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.620 
it definitely is one of the most
challenging<00:02:02.759> games<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.210> picked<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
challenging games that are picked up and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
challenging games that are picked up and
played<00:02:03.780> turbo<00:02:04.350> dismount<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> fantastic

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
played turbo dismount is a fantastic

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.359 
played turbo dismount is a fantastic
application<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.350> heavily<00:02:07.590> driven<00:02:08.039> by

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
application and it's heavily driven by

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.949 
application and it's heavily driven by

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the physics that they have running in

the physics that they have running in
the<00:02:10.050> background<00:02:10.310> really<00:02:11.310> amazing<00:02:11.730> physics

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
the background really amazing physics

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.550 
the background really amazing physics

I<00:02:45.860> was<00:02:46.010> blown<00:02:46.250> away<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.550> angry<00:02:47.090> birds<00:02:47.360> and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
I was blown away that angry birds and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.199 
I was blown away that angry birds and
transformers<00:02:48.560> combined<00:02:49.370> together<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:50.030> create

transformers combined together to create
such<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> fantastic<00:02:50.930> app<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.920> isn't<00:02:52.459> just

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
such a fantastic app here it isn't just

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.270 
such a fantastic app here it isn't just
the<00:02:53.120> stereotypical<00:02:53.690> angry<00:02:54.260> birds<00:02:54.470> game<00:02:54.739> they

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
the stereotypical angry birds game they

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.430 
the stereotypical angry birds game they
still<00:02:55.550> do<00:02:55.730> have<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.239> core<00:02:56.540> fundamentals<00:02:57.290> that

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
still do have the core fundamentals that

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.470 
still do have the core fundamentals that
is<00:02:57.739> angry<00:02:58.370> birds<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> physics<00:02:59.270> in<00:02:59.390> the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
have the bird transformers or whatever

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.340 
have the bird transformers or whatever
their<00:03:07.820> classes<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:08.900> transform
