00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
what am I talking about base designs

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.020 
what am I talking about base designs
we're<00:00:42.989> back<00:00:43.140> doing<00:00:43.590> another<00:00:43.710> base<00:00:44.220> design<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
we're back doing another base design and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
we're back doing another base design and
as<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.900> already<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.290> from<00:00:46.470> that<00:00:46.590> thing

sense whoo okay we got redstone blocks

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.620 
sense whoo okay we got redstone blocks
on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> floor<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.740> another<00:01:26.630> another

with every chest i went with a another

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.400 
with every chest i went with a another
quirk<00:01:35.009> block<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:35.940> yeah<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.380> of

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
quirk block and then yeah it's kind of

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.779 
quirk block and then yeah it's kind of
base<00:01:37.590> i<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.860> thinking<00:01:38.099> about<00:01:38.250> making<00:01:38.429> it<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
base i was thinking about making it on

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.190 
base i was thinking about making it on
mcpvp<00:01:39.330> but<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.080> don't<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.780> why<00:01:42.780> everything

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
mcpvp but I don't know I why everything

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.910 
mcpvp but I don't know I why everything
gets<00:01:43.410> x-rayed<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.160> i<00:01:44.190> doubt<00:01:44.700> i'll<00:01:44.910> do<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.209> um

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
gets x-rayed so i doubt i'll do that um

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.249 
gets x-rayed so i doubt i'll do that um
but<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.160> guys<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.429> like<00:01:47.819> if<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.319> want<00:01:49.319> to<00:01:50.039> UM

but yeah guys it like if you want to UM
change<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> base<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.679> any<00:01:52.830> way<00:01:52.979> shape<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.310> form

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
change the base in any way shape or form

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.990 
change the base in any way shape or form
like<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:55.200> ceiling<00:01:55.709> or<00:01:55.950> without<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> lava<00:01:56.759> or

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
this is a pretty big storage space I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.760 
this is a pretty big storage space I
mean<00:02:06.539> depending<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.020> how<00:02:07.140> many<00:02:07.200> people<00:02:07.349> you're

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
mean depending on how many people you're

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
mean depending on how many people you're
going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.300> it's<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> pretty<00:02:09.899> big<00:02:10.140> storage

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to have it's a pretty big storage

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.540 
going to have it's a pretty big storage
space<00:02:10.800> you're<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.160> split<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.520> between

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
space you're going to split it between

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.180 
space you're going to split it between
two<00:02:11.819> people<00:02:12.209> down<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> middle<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.190> you
