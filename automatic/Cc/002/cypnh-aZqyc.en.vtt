things are loose and we're out and as
you<00:04:11.580> can<00:04:11.730> see<00:04:11.760> there's<00:04:12.150> some<00:04:12.209> ball<00:04:12.510> joints

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
where everything will pop apart guess

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.860 
where everything will pop apart guess
that's<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.410> only<00:04:16.470> downfall<00:04:17.480> about<00:04:18.480> her<00:04:18.660> is

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810
