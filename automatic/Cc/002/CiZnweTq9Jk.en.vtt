there<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.120> was<00:02:06.300> easy<00:02:07.820> next<00:02:08.820> I'm<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
there that was easy next I'm going to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.770 
there that was easy next I'm going to
take<00:02:09.600> my<00:02:09.810> red<00:02:10.050> ribbons<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.690> fold<00:02:12.690> them<00:02:12.870> around

take my red ribbons and fold them around
almost<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.320> figure<00:02:16.710> eight<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:18.540> want<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
almost in a figure eight you want the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.950 
almost in a figure eight you want the
loops<00:02:19.250> pointing<00:02:20.250> inward<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.070> looks<00:02:26.310> like

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
loops pointing inward so it looks like

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.900 
loops pointing inward so it looks like
that<00:02:30.410> make<00:02:31.410> sure<00:02:31.440> your<00:02:31.860> loops<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.400> relatively

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
that make sure your loops are relatively

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.050 
that make sure your loops are relatively
even<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:35.400> you're<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.820> want<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
even and then you're going to want to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.690 
even and then you're going to want to
put<00:02:36.270> some<00:02:36.480> hot<00:02:36.690> glue<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.380> hold<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.770> together

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.010 

doesn't<00:02:41.700> take<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.910> lot<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.750> little<00:02:43.040> and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
doesn't take a lot just a little and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.510 
doesn't take a lot just a little and
because<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.260> ribbon<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.740> thin<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.310> glue

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
because the ribbon is thin and the glue

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.920 
because the ribbon is thin and the glue
is<00:02:47.700> hot<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.709> like<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.980> use<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.660> tweezers<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
is hot I like to use the tweezers to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:10.430 
is hot I like to use the tweezers to
pinch<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.560> together

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.970 

and<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.220> will<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:12.260> for<00:03:13.260> all<00:03:13.290> four

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
and you will do this for all four

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.790 
and you will do this for all four
strands<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.120> red<00:03:15.300> ribbon<00:03:18.530> you'll<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.680> the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
strands of the red ribbon you'll do the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.000 
strands of the red ribbon you'll do the
same<00:03:19.830> kind<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.430> loop<00:03:20.700> for<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.530> green<00:03:22.530> ribbon

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
same kind of loop for the green ribbon

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.750 
same kind of loop for the green ribbon
those<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.490> leaves<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:25.400> once<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.610> have

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
those are the leaves and once you have

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.570 
those are the leaves and once you have
them<00:03:26.880> all<00:03:27.090> glued<00:03:27.980> first<00:03:28.980> thing<00:03:29.220> you'll<00:03:29.400> do<00:03:29.550> is

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
them all glued first thing you'll do is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.990 
them all glued first thing you'll do is
put<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.120> green<00:03:30.360> one<00:03:30.600> at<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.900> end<00:03:30.930> by<00:03:31.800> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
put the green one at the end by the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:46.540 
put the green one at the end by the
pincher<00:03:33.000> part<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> clip

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.210 

ok<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.810> then<00:03:48.440> slightly<00:03:48.860> further<00:03:49.400> down<00:03:51.220> you're

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
ok and then slightly further down you're

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.930 
ok and then slightly further down you're
going<00:03:52.460> to<00:03:52.580> glow<00:03:52.910> your<00:03:53.150> first<00:03:53.510> red<00:03:54.110> loop<00:03:54.940> or

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
going to glow your first red loop or

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.000 
going to glow your first red loop or
petal<00:03:56.600> loop<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:57.050> should<00:03:57.290> say<00:03:57.560> because<00:03:57.800> you

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
petal loop I should say because you

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:10.000 
petal loop I should say because you
could<00:03:58.190> use<00:03:58.370> any<00:03:58.550> color<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:59.090> course

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:45.370 

and<00:04:10.129> you'll<00:04:11.090> crisscross<00:04:11.780> them
