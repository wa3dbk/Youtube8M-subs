00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
thought i would be worse so um i don't

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.720 
thought i would be worse so um i don't
know<00:00:24.960> i<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:25.439> got<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.769> earlier<00:00:26.099> today<00:00:26.279> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

the<00:00:27.300> theater<00:00:27.660> mode<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.470> really<00:00:28.740> really

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the theater mode thing is really really

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
the theater mode thing is really really
confusing<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.119> Call<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> Duty<00:00:30.689> how

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
confusing it's not like Call of Duty how

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.260 
confusing it's not like Call of Duty how
you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> look<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.180> your

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
you can just like go and look at your

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
you can just like go and look at your
recent<00:00:33.450> games<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.230> play<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.309> record

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
recent games and play it and then record

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
recent games and play it and then record
it<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> let<00:00:36.630> go<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.020> save<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it you have to let go and save it to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.270 
it you have to let go and save it to
your<00:00:38.149> ear<00:00:39.149> local<00:00:39.840> storage<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.190> have

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
your ear local storage and then you have

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
your ear local storage and then you have
to<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:41.879> theatre<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.110> weird

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to go into theatre is it's really weird

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.650 
to go into theatre is it's really weird
it's<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.590> weird<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.370> finally<00:00:45.210> got<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it's really weird but I finally got it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.709 
it's really weird but I finally got it
and<00:00:45.690> um<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.670> watching<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and um so you're watching it and this is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.240 
and um so you're watching it and this is
probably<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> my<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:49.620> games<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
probably one of my better games I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
probably one of my better games I
haven't<00:00:50.489> played<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.760> whole<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.629> I've

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
haven't played a whole lot because I've

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
haven't played a whole lot because I've
just<00:00:51.840> been<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> still<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.670> my

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
just been you know I still have to do my

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.260 
just been you know I still have to do my
school<00:00:54.059> work<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.420> stuff<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.250> I

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
school work and stuff like that but I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.110 
school work and stuff like that but I
think<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.690> was<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> 19<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.859> 4<00:00:59.489> gameplay<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
think this one was a 19 in 4 gameplay so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080 
think this one was a 19 in 4 gameplay so
it's<00:01:00.600> pretty<00:01:00.809> good<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.340> for<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.520> seeing<00:01:02.969> as

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it's pretty good for for me seeing as

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
it's pretty good for for me seeing as
I'm<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.019> great<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.470> game<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.860> mean

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
I'm not that great at this game I mean

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.700 
I'm not that great at this game I mean
I'm<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.189> bad<00:01:05.400> i'm<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:05.760> good<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.930> first

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
I'm not bad i'm pretty good at first

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
I'm not bad i'm pretty good at first
person<00:01:07.890> shooters<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> general<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.150> at

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
person shooters just in general but at

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
person shooters just in general but at
this<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.990> game<00:01:10.260> i<00:01:10.530> haven't<00:01:10.890> played<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.100> lot<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
this this game i haven't played a lot of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.899 
this this game i haven't played a lot of
like<00:01:11.820> Halo<00:01:12.270> series<00:01:12.600> game<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.500> um<00:01:14.130> yeah<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
like Halo series game so um yeah I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
like Halo series game so um yeah I
thought<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> did<00:01:15.299> pretty<00:01:15.420> good<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.259> I'm<00:01:16.799> still

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
thought I did pretty good and I'm still

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.050 
thought I did pretty good and I'm still
getting<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> hang<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.909> these

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
getting the hang of this like these

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
getting the hang of this like these
killstreaks<00:01:18.720> these<00:01:18.960> look<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.320> pretty

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
killstreaks these look actually pretty

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
killstreaks these look actually pretty
cool<00:01:19.920> i<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> kill<00:01:20.790> streak<00:01:20.939> like

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
cool i think you get a kill streak like

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
cool i think you get a kill streak like
every<00:01:21.810> four<00:01:22.470> kills<00:01:22.890> or<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.250> four<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.670> five

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
every four kills or so four or five

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.359 
every four kills or so four or five
pills<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.530> choose<00:01:25.950> on

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
pills and then you get to like choose on

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
pills and then you get to like choose on
a<00:01:26.570> weapon<00:01:27.570> that's<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.920> one

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
a weapon that's on there and this one

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
a weapon that's on there and this one
had<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> sniper<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.970> shotgun<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.600> i

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
had like a sniper in a shotgun so i

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.950 
had like a sniper in a shotgun so i
picked<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> sniper<00:01:31.320> which<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.820> am<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.869> good

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
picked a sniper which i am not very good

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
picked a sniper which i am not very good
at<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> sniper<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:35.310> i<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
at the sniper these i think it just
