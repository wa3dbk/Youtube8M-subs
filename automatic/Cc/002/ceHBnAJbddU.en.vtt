new little bit of the new design looks

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.109 
new little bit of the new design looks
very<00:00:24.750> similar<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.170> past<00:00:26.010> Galaxy<00:00:26.519> devices<00:00:26.670> with

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
very similar to past Galaxy devices with

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.200 
very similar to past Galaxy devices with
that<00:00:27.269> new<00:00:27.420> perforated<00:00:28.250> look<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.760> back

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.180 

and<00:00:33.969> as<00:00:34.969> a<00:00:35.000> full<00:00:35.270> HD<00:00:35.540> display<00:00:35.960> we<00:00:36.829> didn't<00:00:37.070> get

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
and as a full HD display we didn't get

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.979 
and as a full HD display we didn't get
to<00:00:37.370> version<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.879> galaxy<00:00:38.360> s5<00:00:38.660> like<00:00:38.870> we

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
to version to the galaxy s5 like we

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.680 
to version to the galaxy s5 like we
thought<00:00:39.170> we<00:00:39.410> would<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.430> display<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:41.059> an

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
thought we would the display is an

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.540 
thought we would the display is an
active<00:00:42.019> display<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.710> changes<00:00:43.129> with<00:00:43.309> based

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
active display so it changes with based

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.090 
active display so it changes with based
on<00:00:43.730> colors<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.809> has<00:00:44.930> super<00:00:45.590> dimming<00:00:45.949> the

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
on colors and it has super dimming the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.130 
on colors and it has super dimming the
battery<00:00:46.790> is<00:00:46.969> 2800<00:00:47.840> familiars<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:50.629> we'll<00:00:51.110> also

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
battery is 2800 familiars and we'll also

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.579 
battery is 2800 familiars and we'll also
have<00:00:51.530> an<00:00:52.010> ultra<00:00:52.489> power<00:00:52.670> saving<00:00:52.820> mode<00:00:53.589> that

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
have an ultra power saving mode that

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.210 
have an ultra power saving mode that
will<00:00:54.649> at<00:00:55.010> ten<00:00:55.280> percent<00:00:55.640> left<00:00:55.909> here<00:00:56.540> will

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
will at ten percent left here will

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.590 
will at ten percent left here will
basically<00:00:58.220> make<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:59.059> a<00:00:59.120> black<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.510> white

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
basically make it a black and white

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.930 
basically make it a black and white
picture<00:00:59.720> and<00:01:00.620> turn<00:01:00.890> out<00:01:01.070> much<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.729> things

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
picture and turn out much of the things

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.490 
picture and turn out much of the things
that<00:01:02.030> separate<00:01:02.420> text<00:01:02.720> messages<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.260> calls

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
that separate text messages and calls

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.150 
that separate text messages and calls
which<00:01:04.129> would<00:01:04.280> make<00:01:04.429> it<00:01:04.489> going<00:01:04.789> on<00:01:04.879> 24<00:01:05.479> hours<00:01:06.160> in

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
which would make it going on 24 hours in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.840 
which would make it going on 24 hours in
standby<00:01:08.060> mode

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.570 

the<00:01:11.270> UI<00:01:11.450> looks<00:01:12.290> very<00:01:12.650> much<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.890> same<00:01:13.130> as<00:01:13.490> in

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
the UI looks very much the same as in

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.399 
the UI looks very much the same as in
the<00:01:13.670> past<00:01:13.820> they're<00:01:14.479> calling<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:14.990> simpler

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
the past they're calling it a simpler

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.030 
the past they're calling it a simpler
look<00:01:15.970> in<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.090> settings<00:01:19.600> settings<00:01:20.600> there

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
look in the settings settings there

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.410 
look in the settings settings there
touch<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.220> Settings<00:01:22.369> properly<00:01:23.000> has<00:01:23.390> a

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
it but the home button does have a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.249 
it but the home button does have a
fingerprint<00:01:34.280> scanner<00:01:34.580> built<00:01:35.570> into<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.140> and

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
fingerprint scanner built into it and

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.410 
fingerprint scanner built into it and
just<00:01:36.409> slide<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:37.009> why<00:01:37.640> they<00:01:37.880> didn't<00:01:38.119> talk<00:01:38.270> about

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
it is good if it's going to accept

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.370 
it is good if it's going to accept
different<00:01:40.670> fingers<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.780> open<00:01:41.990> up<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.200> phone

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
different fingers to open up the phone

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.809 
different fingers to open up the phone
apps<00:01:42.530> but<00:01:42.799> that<00:01:42.979> may<00:01:43.130> be<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.310> case<00:01:43.460> as<00:01:43.640> well
