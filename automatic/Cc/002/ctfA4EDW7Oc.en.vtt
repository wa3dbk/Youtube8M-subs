00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
show to show we had you know we grew up

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.969 
show to show we had you know we grew up
without<00:01:31.630> all<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.170> when<00:01:32.350> we<00:01:32.440> started<00:01:32.740> again

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
without all that when we started again

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.100 
without all that when we started again
but<00:01:33.220> there's<00:01:34.060> definitely<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.390> lot<00:01:34.479> more<00:01:34.539> bands

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
but there's definitely a lot more bands

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.840 
but there's definitely a lot more bands
now<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.770> it's<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.190> know<00:01:36.220> there's<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.580> big

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
now and it's you know there's a big

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.969 
now and it's you know there's a big
influx<00:01:37.299> it's<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.630> million<00:01:37.960> bands<00:01:38.200> hitting

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
influx it's a million bands hitting

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.649 
influx it's a million bands hitting
everyone's<00:01:39.310> ears<00:01:39.700> at<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.880> same<00:01:39.969> time<00:01:40.299> all<00:01:40.539> the

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
everyone's ears at the same time all the

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.120 
everyone's ears at the same time all the
time<00:01:40.689> so<00:01:41.079> it's<00:01:41.109> probably<00:01:41.409> harder<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.890> kind<00:01:42.039> of

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
time so it's probably harder to kind of

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.760 
time so it's probably harder to kind of
cut<00:01:42.399> through<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:42.969> these<00:01:43.570> like<00:01:44.079> found<00:01:44.409> or
