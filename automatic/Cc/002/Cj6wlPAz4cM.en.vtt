00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
they're both there with a period of

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.379 
they're both there with a period of
really<00:00:56.019> sturdy<00:00:57.010> set<00:00:57.309> really<00:00:57.699> sturdy<00:00:58.149> packs

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.389

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.800 
I'm trying to keep them as intact as
possible<00:01:05.409> which<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.590> why<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.890> always<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:07.659> that

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
possible which is why I always do that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.820
