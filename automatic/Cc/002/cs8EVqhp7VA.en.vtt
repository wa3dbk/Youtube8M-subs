00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.160
 so thank you is radiant to the world that you 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.590
 diversify their sector of activity 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
 actually this project emmaus in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 partnership with kobo was to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059
 develop this constructive system 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.309
 up to the housing level this is the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.170
 first housing that it achieves in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.489
 whole to the end loan ready 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.500
 dry industry 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.470
 the idea being that we work in the dry 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.250
 and that the finished evening panel 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.580
 internally and externally 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.199
 joinery pose electricity pose and 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.030
 the insulation incorporated between the two 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.220
 two parliaments actually took 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.330
 the option of 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.920
 to set up in the factory a maul 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.710
 allowing the carpenters so there in 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.050
 the occurrence the house scrublands become 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 position in conditions 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.790
 optimal all the joinery the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.890
 shutter boxes and so 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.800
 to ensure all seals water and 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.450
 air but more powerful possible then 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.100
 there is an important idea that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.840
 has been developing several 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.300
 years with wax that's the idea actually 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.980
 bring to the building site elements 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.520
 which is an important finishing state 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.280
 suddenly the ceilings of Emmaus by 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.830
 example that will stay raw concrete 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 are printed with a matrix that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.030
 allows to have a relief and this relief 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.410
 create a captivating finish that breaks 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.670
 the use of the concrete itself and 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.590
 try to go faster 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.650
 possible and as directly as possible 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.850
 to a state of completion since in fact we 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.550
 realizes that on construction sites 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.380
 current modern there are a lot of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.500
 successive layers of finishing on the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.620
 buildings in the cash face of 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.170
 embellishers painting the idea this is 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.840
 that here the quality of products are 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.370
 sufficient and even exceptional for 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.980
 that she can remain in her state on 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.600
 as close as possible to the gross 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.700
 it must also be added that in the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.880
 editing process that wax puts into 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.700
 place with his editor and bat on 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.730
 incorporates the bathrooms that are 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.950
 carried out on a site in the north of the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.690
 France by the completed company in and the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.870
 bathrooms will be brought into the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.519
 same delay in the same rhythm as the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.500
 facade panels is laid by the same 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.860
 installers do that the mason in 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.709
 the occurrence the wax becomes at once 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.049
 concrete installer woodworker alu 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.519
 bathroom poser and it's like 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.170
 that we get the very short time 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.420
 yes so m 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.770
 now in the camp what is that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.090
 has changed so unfortunately the part 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.580
 home you see it they are at home 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.810
 then it is a habitat that is known 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.810
 not the stakes I have online 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.180
 e 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.180

 we love me 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.890
 we 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.080
 so
