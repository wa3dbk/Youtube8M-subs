 hi i am like you and i would like to speak the following subliminal message topic 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.909
 today we are full to the top of hidden advertising 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.970
 sometimes we can not even perceive it ourselves 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 but what we do not know how to say how many effects it can have on our 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.460
 mind 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.179
 there was an example in the United States that is ready in a movie 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.370
 they put two laws in force in the same movie of course one said you have 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.490
 hungry eat popcorn has faith 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.850
 against coca cola 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.080
 it surpassed at least twice the statistics of people who will buy 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.360
 coasts 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 in the cinema function 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.870
 terol was not even achieved that most people were to buy 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.550
 the effect that is generated in the brain is very complex because the message that you 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 with seven fails to distinguish the conscientious mandate 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.239
 and in the subconscious it is processed and camouflaged to return to the conscious 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.730
 and in reflecting on your life 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.250
 how do you do this 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.940
 l yapa tablet your eyes your visit with the naked eye can not detect it but 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.700
 your subconscious professes that phrase 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.070
 how to camouflage 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.830
 pass your conscious and you des 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.930
 I want a Coke you go shopping Coke in front of the baby 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.760
 It is quite simple and quite complex at the same time as there are a lot of people 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.759
 who loves to put hidden messages in their songs and in their advertising 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.260
 they can be reciprocally by advertising or they can be under effects 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.530
 apanic 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.120
 yes it really is very worrying 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.930
 as I am here and many more examples 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.440
 on television and in the cinema 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 and at this point of the game there should be conscious people say that is what 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.620
 what are they doing and seeing their children 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.180
 you have to control it and you have to know how and where because otherwise 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.050
 of control marketing uses this type of mind control in children and 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.920
 they do exactly what they want them to do and this not only the children also 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 in adults of course 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.719
 let's not leave these things because I efecom
