recommend<00:02:26.430> Andy<00:02:27.430> cam<00:02:27.760> because<00:02:28.450> well<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:30.430> sucks

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
recommend Andy cam because well it sucks

recommend Andy cam because well it sucks
makes<00:02:31.570> good<00:02:31.780> power<00:02:32.100> but<00:02:33.510> about<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.980> that's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
makes good power but about it that's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.930 
makes good power but about it that's
pretty<00:02:36.220> much<00:02:36.700> as<00:02:36.880> simple<00:02:37.030> as<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.390> setup<00:02:37.630> is
