00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.980 
source at all yeah I think it's the best
bit<00:05:16.310> of<00:05:16.370> planting<00:05:16.699> the<00:05:16.789> garden<00:05:16.819> actually<00:05:17.449> only

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
bit of planting the garden actually only

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.600 
bit of planting the garden actually only
the<00:05:18.139> rest<00:05:18.289> of<00:05:18.469> it's<00:05:18.590> complete<00:05:18.919> rubbish<00:05:19.009> except

the rest of it's complete rubbish except
for<00:05:19.729> that<00:05:19.819> I<00:05:20.240> thought<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:20.690> know<00:05:20.840> what<00:05:21.050> the

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
for that I thought you know what the

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.709 
for that I thought you know what the
more<00:05:22.159> or<00:05:22.219> less<00:05:22.550> time<00:05:22.759> to<00:05:22.909> grow<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.090> little<00:05:23.270> here

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:23.719
