use<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.950> from<00:02:17.160> now<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> meet<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.500> new<00:02:25.709> cerana

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.080 

so<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.120> was<00:02:30.480> searching<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.230> mods<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.579> found

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
so I was searching for mods and I found

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.379 
so I was searching for mods and I found
this<00:02:33.389> one<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.959> couldn't<00:02:34.859> resist<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.609> face<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
this one I couldn't resist that face and

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.129 
this one I couldn't resist that face and
I<00:02:36.930> diluted<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.889> and<00:02:38.100> put<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.239> show<00:02:39.480> it's
