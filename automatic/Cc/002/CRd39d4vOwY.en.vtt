seriously change the cut off the texture
you<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.789> kind<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.180> distinguish<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.900> from<00:00:18.930> our

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
you can kind of distinguish it from our

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.050 
you can kind of distinguish it from our
background<00:00:21.320> green<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> Grinch<00:00:23.010> kind<00:00:23.880> of

life and in order to achieve some 3d

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.770 
life and in order to achieve some 3d
effect<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.730> go<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> modify<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
effect we have to go to modify and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.180 
effect we have to go to modify and
choose<00:00:34.559> bevel<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.780> as<00:00:36.780> soon<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.590> down<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
choose bevel and as soon as I down that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.260 
choose bevel and as soon as I down that
you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.690> shady<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.820> but<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.000> not

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you can see it's shady now but it's not

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.170 
you can see it's shady now but it's not
a<00:00:42.300> bad<00:00:42.540> match<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.370> play<00:00:44.700> around

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
a bad match so I'm gonna play around

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.869 
a bad match so I'm gonna play around
this<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:46.110> bit<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.770> first<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.820> should

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
this little bit at first we should

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.939 
this little bit at first we should
adjust<00:00:48.420> some<00:00:48.840> bevel<00:00:49.379> value<00:00:50.270> we<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
adjust some bevel value we are about to

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.420 
adjust some bevel value we are about to
increase<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.219> thickness<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.360> text<00:00:54.899> so

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
increase the thickness of the text so

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.889 
increase the thickness of the text so
personally<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:57.420> should<00:00:57.449> use

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
personally I think we should use

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.189 
personally I think we should use
negative<00:00:58.230> value<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> height<00:00:59.670> oh<00:01:00.199> Jesus

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
negative value for the height oh Jesus

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.399 
negative value for the height oh Jesus
Christ<00:01:01.730> bring<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> ugly<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.809> case<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
Christ bring you the ugly in this case I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.550 
Christ bring you the ugly in this case I
should<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.580> back<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.860> purple<00:01:07.970> can't<00:01:08.970> remember

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
should go back to purple can't remember

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
should go back to purple can't remember
but<00:01:10.560> anyway<00:01:11.040> we'll<00:01:11.460> already<00:01:11.610> achieved<00:01:12.270> some

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
but anyway we'll already achieved some

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.030 
but anyway we'll already achieved some
3d<00:01:13.650> talking<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> fragged<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:16.110> definitely<00:01:16.799> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
3d talking you fragged but definitely we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
3d talking you fragged but definitely we
can<00:01:17.250> produce<00:01:17.490> some<00:01:18.060> better<00:01:18.360> work<00:01:19.250> ok<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.939> time

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
can produce some better work ok now time

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.910 
can produce some better work ok now time
to<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.200> level<00:01:22.740> 2<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> level<00:01:23.369> 3<00:01:24.560> first<00:01:25.560> we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
to use level 2 and level 3 first we

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.390 
to use level 2 and level 3 first we
should<00:01:26.330> decrease<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.869> height<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.380> level<00:01:29.189> one

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
should decrease the height of level one

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.440 
should decrease the height of level one
under<00:01:30.150> turn<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.079> learn<00:01:31.619> outline<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.790> level<00:01:33.270> one

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
under turn up learn outline of level one

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.749 
under turn up learn outline of level one
just<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.729> some

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
just a little bit so we can have some

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.950 
just a little bit so we can have some
shading<00:01:36.390> effect

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.380 

hit<00:01:39.960> f3<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.610> polygons

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
hit f3 so we can see polygons

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.580 
hit f3 so we can see polygons
transformed<00:01:43.320> step<00:01:43.710> by<00:01:44.010> step<00:01:45.170> we<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.350> use

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
transformed step by step we will use

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.430 
transformed step by step we will use
level<00:01:47.100> 2<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.910> main<00:01:48.150> part<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:49.020> text

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
level 2 for the main part of this text

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.510 
level 2 for the main part of this text
under<00:01:50.070> use<00:01:50.280> level<00:01:50.760> 3<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.270> another<00:01:51.600> shading

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.349 

and<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:56.409> eventually<00:01:56.799> turned<00:01:57.609> out<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:58.000> be<00:01:58.149> more

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
and it eventually turned out to be more

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.669 
and it eventually turned out to be more
smooth<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.840> basically<00:02:02.049> how<00:02:02.469> you

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
smooth so that's basically how you

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.109 
smooth so that's basically how you
create<00:02:03.280> your<00:02:03.490> text<00:02:04.119> ringing<00:02:04.590> 3ds<00:02:05.590> max<00:02:06.119> 2011

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
create your text ringing 3ds max 2011

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.330 
create your text ringing 3ds max 2011
hope<00:02:07.719> you<00:02:07.869> learned<00:02:08.110> something<00:02:08.410> for<00:02:08.769> that<00:02:09.330> bye
