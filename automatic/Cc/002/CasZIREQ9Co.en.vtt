maker and I have taught other people to

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.459 
maker and I have taught other people to
make<00:00:11.250> cinches<00:00:11.880> as<00:00:12.059> well<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.110> thing<00:00:13.320> I've

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
make cinches as well and the thing I've

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.070 
make cinches as well and the thing I've
noticed<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.950> these<00:00:14.130> classes<00:00:14.700> there<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.630> one

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
noticed in these classes there is one

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.800 
noticed in these classes there is one
technique<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.130> seems<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.609> be<00:00:17.730> evasive<00:00:18.240> so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
technique that seems to be evasive so

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.290 
technique that seems to be evasive so
I'm<00:00:18.990> going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.230> go<00:00:19.380> over<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.830> technique<00:00:20.460> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
I'm going to go over that technique in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.550 
I'm going to go over that technique in
detail<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.880> leave<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.539> youtube<00:00:25.260> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
detail and leave it here on youtube so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.470 
detail and leave it here on youtube so
you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.830> refer<00:00:26.130> back<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.609> anytime<00:00:27.240> you

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
you can refer back to it anytime you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.410 
you can refer back to it anytime you
need<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.789> technique<00:00:30.210> we

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
need to do so this is the technique we

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.530 
need to do so this is the technique we
use<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:31.320> starting<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:33.000> turning<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
use for starting and for turning it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.799 
use for starting and for turning it
around<00:00:33.800> your<00:00:34.800> two-ply<00:00:35.399> yarn<00:00:35.630> when<00:00:36.630> you're

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
around your two-ply yarn when you're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.910 
around your two-ply yarn when you're
making<00:00:36.989> either<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.590> bar<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> diamond<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
making either a bar or a diamond so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.090 
making either a bar or a diamond so
listen<00:00:40.920> close<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:42.680> outside<00:00:43.680> strands

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
listen close here you go outside strands

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.889 
listen close here you go outside strands
going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:44.579> across<00:00:44.910> toward<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> middle<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
going to go across toward the middle and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
going to go across toward the middle and
the<00:00:46.829> inside<00:00:47.160> strand<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.059> go

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the inside strand is going to go

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
the inside strand is going to go
wrapping<00:00:48.870> around<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.969> making<00:00:50.969> an<00:00:51.329> X<00:00:52.370> see

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
wrapping around it and making an X see

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
wrapping around it and making an X see
how<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.699> makes<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.149> X<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.510> top<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:55.530> one

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
how that makes an X on top now one

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.420 
how that makes an X on top now one
problem<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.510> doing<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:59.070> if

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
problem of doing it that way is if if

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.220 
problem of doing it that way is if if
you're<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.059> holding<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.840> pull<00:01:01.050> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you're not holding it and you pull this

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.789 
you're not holding it and you pull this
tight<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:02.100> X<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.699> roll<00:01:02.910> around<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.799> cross

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
tight that X will roll around and cross

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
tight that X will roll around and cross
on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> back<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.330> position<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
on the back and in that position the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.200 
on the back and in that position the
horse<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.890> feel<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.090> want

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
horse will feel it and you don't want

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
horse will feel it and you don't want
that<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.439> nice<00:01:11.010> smooth<00:01:12.890> side<00:01:13.890> by<00:01:14.130> side

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that you want a nice smooth side by side

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.170 
that you want a nice smooth side by side
you<00:01:14.820> want<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.470> two<00:01:16.710> strands<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.759> lie<00:01:17.880> side

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you want the the two strands to lie side

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
you want the the two strands to lie side
by<00:01:18.210> side<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> horse<00:01:19.170> doesn't<00:01:19.590> feel<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
by side so the horse doesn't feel it a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.030 
by side so the horse doesn't feel it a
little<00:01:20.729> lump<00:01:21.030> from<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> crossover<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.830> one

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
little lump from the crossover now one

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190 
little lump from the crossover now one
way<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> figured<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:23.939> how<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.509> stay<00:01:25.170> on

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
way I figured out how to make it stay on

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
way I figured out how to make it stay on
the<00:01:25.409> top<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:28.220> instead

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the top it is to do it like this instead

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710 
the top it is to do it like this instead
of<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.460> straight<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of going straight here I'm going to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
of going straight here I'm going to
leave<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.170> slack<00:01:32.090> I'll<00:01:33.090> hold<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.450> in

that<00:02:07.439> hang<00:02:07.710> down<00:02:07.920> grab<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.640> next<00:02:09.030> strand<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.450> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that hang down grab the next strand of a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.229 
that hang down grab the next strand of a
play<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.330 

do<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> same<00:02:13.110> thing<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.159> go

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
do the same thing it's going to go

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.229 
do the same thing it's going to go
around<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.890> continue<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.579> that<00:02:17.610> same<00:02:18.000> way<00:02:20.239> all

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
around and continue in that same way all

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.380 
around and continue in that same way all
the<00:02:21.450> way<00:02:21.680> across<00:02:25.400> you'll<00:02:26.400> notice<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.000> each

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the way across you'll notice that each

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.750 
the way across you'll notice that each
time<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> take<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> new<00:02:28.500> step<00:02:28.530> I'll<00:02:29.310> grab<00:02:29.579> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
time I take a new step I'll grab the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.440 
time I take a new step I'll grab the
next<00:02:29.939> H<00:02:30.239> fly<00:02:30.870> strand<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.620> I'm<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.459> let

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
next H fly strand and I'm going to let

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.539 
next H fly strand and I'm going to let
the<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.680> leading<00:02:34.980> strand<00:02:35.790> hang<00:02:36.480> down<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
the the leading strand hang down and the

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.670 
the the leading strand hang down and the
trailing<00:02:38.819> strand<00:02:39.329> go<00:02:41.450> over<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.629> around<00:02:42.720> pick

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
trailing strand go over and around pick

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.319 
trailing strand go over and around pick
up<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.950> next<00:02:44.129> strand<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.670> eight<00:02:44.760> ply<00:02:47.120> over<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
up the next strand of eight ply over and

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.979 
up the next strand of eight ply over and
around<00:02:51.079> by<00:02:52.079> doing<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.590> way<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:54.510> actually

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
around by doing it this way it actually

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.170 
around by doing it this way it actually
twists<00:02:55.440> around<00:02:55.560> itself<00:02:55.889> each<00:02:56.459> time<00:02:56.879> you<00:02:57.030> do

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
twists around itself each time you do

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.849 
twists around itself each time you do
this<00:02:58.849> if<00:02:59.849> she<00:02:59.909> if<00:03:00.389> you<00:03:00.629> should<00:03:00.840> happen<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.230> put

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
this if she if you should happen to put

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.140 
this if she if you should happen to put
it<00:03:01.980> up<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:03.530> take<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:05.000> take<00:03:06.000> it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
it up like that and take a take it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.500 
it up like that and take a take it
around

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
around

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.920 
around
it<00:03:06.900> won't<00:03:07.139> twist<00:03:07.349> around<00:03:07.620> itself<00:03:08.659> and<00:03:09.659> it'll

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it won't twist around itself and it'll

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
it won't twist around itself and it'll
start<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.379> come<00:03:10.739> apart<00:03:10.889> so<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:11.579> very

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
start to come apart so it's very

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.410 
start to come apart so it's very
important<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.079> leading<00:03:13.680> strand

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
important to have that leading strand

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:23.180 
important to have that leading strand
down<00:03:15.769> when<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.859> take<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.250> next<00:03:17.430> stitch<00:03:22.190> now

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
down when you take the next stitch now

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.089 
down when you take the next stitch now
you'll<00:03:23.430> remember<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:24.180> said<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:25.500> use<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.859> same

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
you'll remember I said you use the same

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.890 
you'll remember I said you use the same
move<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.790> start<00:03:27.859> or<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:29.220> turn<00:03:29.459> around<00:03:29.900> we're

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
move to start or to turn around we're

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.449 
move to start or to turn around we're
going<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.169> turn<00:03:31.349> around<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.859> moment<00:03:32.250> when<00:03:32.430> we

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
going to turn around in a moment when we

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.360 
going to turn around in a moment when we
reach<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.060> other<00:03:33.239> side<00:03:33.949> and<00:03:34.949> I'll<00:03:35.129> show<00:03:35.340> you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
reach the other side and I'll show you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.339 
reach the other side and I'll show you
how<00:03:35.639> we<00:03:36.299> use<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.750> same<00:03:38.269> technique

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
how we use the same technique

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.729 
how we use the same technique
when<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:41.400> get<00:03:41.549> there<00:03:41.760> here<00:03:42.540> we<00:03:42.690> are<00:03:42.720> we're<00:03:43.530> at

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
when we get there here we are we're at

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.949 
when we get there here we are we're at
the<00:03:43.889> other<00:03:44.040> side<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.269> want<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.599> turn<00:03:45.810> around

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
the other side now I want to turn around

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.890 
the other side now I want to turn around
and<00:03:46.290> go<00:03:46.379> back<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:46.769> way<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.510> remember<00:03:48.510> to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and go back this way so remember to

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.879 
and go back this way so remember to
start<00:03:49.139> we<00:03:49.319> take<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.709> outside<00:03:50.280> strand<00:03:51.889> bring

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
start we take the outside strand bring

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.210 
start we take the outside strand bring
it<00:03:53.010> across<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.959> leave<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> little<00:03:55.260> slack<00:03:55.680> and

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
it across and leave a little slack and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.830 
it across and leave a little slack and
I'm<00:03:56.609> going<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.819> hold<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.209> place<00:03:57.359> with<00:03:57.659> my

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
I'm going to hold it in place with my

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.830 
I'm going to hold it in place with my
thumb<00:03:59.239> now<00:04:00.239> I'll<00:04:00.840> wrap<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:03.150> other<00:04:03.359> strand

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
thumb now I'll wrap the other strand

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.339 
thumb now I'll wrap the other strand
around<00:04:04.049> this<00:04:04.889> 2<00:04:05.190> ply<00:04:05.400> strand<00:04:05.819> around<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.199> 8

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
around this 2 ply strand around the 8

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.160 
around this 2 ply strand around the 8
ply

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.979 

that<00:04:11.319> good<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.040> tight<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.030> then<00:04:16.600> I'll<00:04:16.720> take

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that good and tight and then I'll take

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.940 
that good and tight and then I'll take
the<00:04:17.169> slack<00:04:17.440> out<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:19.600> remember<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.200> now

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
the slack out now remember that now

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.530 
the slack out now remember that now
we're<00:04:21.160> going<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.519> way<00:04:21.579> so<00:04:21.760> this<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.419> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
we're going that way so this is the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.180 
we're going that way so this is the
leading<00:04:22.750> strand<00:04:23.230> this<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.770> trailing

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
leading strand this is the trailing

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.220 
leading strand this is the trailing
strand<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:25.180> we'll<00:04:25.300> do<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.570> same<00:04:25.750> thing<00:04:26.080> going

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
strand and we'll do the same thing going

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.870 
strand and we'll do the same thing going
back<00:04:28.350> each<00:04:29.350> time<00:04:29.740> making<00:04:30.220> sure<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.550> leading

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
back each time making sure the leading

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.420 
back each time making sure the leading
strand<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.770> down<00:04:32.770> out<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.820> way<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:36.400> make

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
strand is down out of the way to make

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.909 
strand is down out of the way to make
sure<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:36.910> twists<00:04:37.270> now<00:04:37.930> up<00:04:38.290> until<00:04:38.500> this<00:04:38.710> point

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
sure it twists now up until this point

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.070 
sure it twists now up until this point
I've<00:04:39.340> had<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.760> hold<00:04:39.970> everything<00:04:40.270> together<00:04:40.570> now

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
I've had to hold everything together now

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.159 
I've had to hold everything together now
that<00:04:41.740> I've<00:04:42.190> gone<00:04:42.880> clear<00:04:43.300> across<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.960> turned

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
that I've gone clear across and turned

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.320 
that I've gone clear across and turned
back<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:45.010> will<00:04:45.190> kind<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.490> stay<00:04:45.729> in<00:04:45.880> place<00:04:46.530> as<00:04:47.530> I

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
back it will kind of stay in place as I

00:04:48.330 --> 00:05:03.000 
back it will kind of stay in place as I
do<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.479> rest<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:51.850> this<00:04:52.950> three<00:04:53.950> row<00:04:54.130> bar<00:05:01.860> once<00:05:02.860> I
