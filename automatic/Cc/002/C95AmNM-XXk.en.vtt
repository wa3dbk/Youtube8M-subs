this little section down here which is
called<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.990> input<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.710> output<00:00:29.890> level<00:00:30.400> so

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
called the input and output level so

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.760 
called the input and output level so
your<00:00:30.700> input<00:00:30.849> levels<00:00:31.300> output<00:00:32.259> levels<00:00:32.559> and

the gray slider in the middle often
referred<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.530> as<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.770> gamma<00:01:06.009> slider<00:01:06.340> because

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
referred to as the gamma slider because

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.210 
referred to as the gamma slider because
it's<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.880> mid<00:01:07.149> gray<00:01:07.509> point<00:01:07.899> so<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.860> is<00:01:09.039> a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
it's the mid gray point so this is a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's the mid gray point so this is a
pixel<00:01:09.759> value<00:01:09.990> okay<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.050> it's<00:01:11.530> saying<00:01:11.740> the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
pixel value okay so it's saying the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.480 
pixel value okay so it's saying the
pixel<00:01:12.310> value<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:12.850> zero<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.960> pure<00:01:14.890> black<00:01:15.190> and

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
pixel value of zero is pure black and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.170 
pixel value of zero is pure black and
this<00:01:16.479> here<00:01:16.750> 255<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.710> pixel<00:01:18.220> value<00:01:18.250> of<00:01:18.580> 255

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
this here 255 is a pixel value of 255

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.380 
this here 255 is a pixel value of 255
which<00:01:19.750> is<00:01:19.930> this<00:01:20.050> slider<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:21.160> pure<00:01:21.640> white<00:01:21.970> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
which is this slider is pure white and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.219 
which is this slider is pure white and
the<00:01:23.020> value<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.380> one<00:01:23.800> is<00:01:24.160> pure<00:01:24.640> gray<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
the value of one is pure gray so the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.770 
the value of one is pure gray so the
pixel<00:01:26.440> values<00:01:26.920> from<00:01:27.340> total<00:01:27.940> black<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.420> total

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
pixel values from total black to total

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.620 
pixel values from total black to total
white<00:01:28.929> in<00:01:29.110> our<00:01:29.320> shot<00:01:29.680> go<00:01:30.340> from<00:01:30.549> zero<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.939> 255

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
white in our shot go from zero to 255

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.980 
white in our shot go from zero to 255
and<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.049> midpoint<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.799> one<00:01:33.689> okay<00:01:34.689> so<00:01:34.720> if<00:01:34.900> we

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
and the midpoint is one okay so if we

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.990 
and the midpoint is one okay so if we
look<00:01:35.020> at<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.380> shot<00:01:35.619> over<00:01:35.920> here<00:01:36.189> we<00:01:36.729> can<00:01:36.790> see

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
look at the shot over here we can see

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.070 
look at the shot over here we can see
that<00:01:37.119> we've<00:01:37.240> got<00:01:37.270> things<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.750> should<00:01:38.049> be

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
that we've got things that should be

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.020 
that we've got things that should be
white<00:01:38.350> like<00:01:38.409> his<00:01:38.740> collar<00:01:39.009> things<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.880> should

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
white like his collar things that should

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.179 
white like his collar things that should
be<00:01:40.060> black<00:01:40.390> like<00:01:40.689> just<00:01:41.049> inside<00:01:41.470> his<00:01:41.710> bowtie<00:01:42.159> or

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
be black like just inside his bowtie or

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.929 
be black like just inside his bowtie or
possibly<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.909> base<00:01:43.210> of<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.600> teapot<00:01:44.500> here

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
possibly the base of this teapot here

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.249 
possibly the base of this teapot here
although<00:01:45.939> we<00:01:46.180> might<00:01:46.390> not<00:01:46.570> be<00:01:46.630> able<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.900> find<00:01:47.170> a

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
although we might not be able to find a

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.719 
although we might not be able to find a
true<00:01:47.560> black<00:01:47.799> point<00:01:48.130> because<00:01:48.400> there<00:01:48.490> isn't

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
true black point because there isn't

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.340 
true black point because there isn't
really<00:01:48.850> anything<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.540> truly<00:01:50.140> black

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
really anything that is truly black

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.810 
really anything that is truly black
because<00:01:50.770> even<00:01:51.100> though<00:01:51.189> some<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.520> these<00:01:51.579> things

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
because even though some of these things

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.969 
because even though some of these things
look<00:01:52.180> black<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.810> reality<00:01:53.439> they're<00:01:53.619> probably

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
look black in reality they're probably

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.760 
look black in reality they're probably
near<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> grey<00:01:54.549> than<00:01:54.790> pure<00:01:55.060> black<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.770> who

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
near a grey than pure black and who

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.950 
near a grey than pure black and who
knows<00:01:57.070> what<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.670> supposed<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.000> be<00:01:58.119> pure<00:01:58.329> gray<00:01:58.689> I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
knows what is supposed to be pure gray I

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.139 
knows what is supposed to be pure gray I
could<00:01:59.619> click<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.100> actually<00:02:00.520> select<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.939> great

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
could click and actually select a great

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.819 
could click and actually select a great
point<00:02:01.390> by<00:02:01.570> choosing<00:02:02.049> this<00:02:02.140> picker<00:02:02.439> here<00:02:02.710> and

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
trying to say take the gray of his hair

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.690 
trying to say take the gray of his hair
or<00:02:04.479> something<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.049> you<00:02:05.979> can<00:02:06.130> never<00:02:06.369> tell<00:02:06.670> if

it's<00:02:06.850> going<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.119> work<00:02:07.329> so<00:02:08.200> what's<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:08.890> all

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
it's going to work so what's this all

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.410 
it's going to work so what's this all
about

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
about

okay<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:10.840> we<00:02:10.959> need<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.260> do<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.650> we<00:02:11.860> need<00:02:12.010> to

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
okay what we need to do is we need to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.490 
okay what we need to do is we need to
tell<00:02:12.610> Premiere<00:02:13.150> Pro<00:02:13.209> what<00:02:13.720> should<00:02:14.019> be<00:02:14.170> pure

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
tell Premiere Pro what should be pure

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.190 
tell Premiere Pro what should be pure
white<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.940> say<00:02:16.180> all<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.690> pixels

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
white so that it can say all the pixels

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.009 
white so that it can say all the pixels
from<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.100> value<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.730> above<00:02:19.150> are<00:02:19.450> pushed<00:02:19.870> to

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
from that value and above are pushed to

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.199 
from that value and above are pushed to
pure<00:02:20.230> white<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:21.400> collar<00:02:21.700> at<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.940> moment

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
pure white so this collar at the moment

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.970 
pure white so this collar at the moment
actually<00:02:22.390> isn't<00:02:22.750> for<00:02:23.079> your<00:02:23.170> white<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.769> if<00:02:23.860> I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
actually isn't for your white and if I

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.830 
actually isn't for your white and if I
take<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.310> picker<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.790> take<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> white<00:02:25.329> level

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
take the picker to take the white level

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.259 
take the picker to take the white level
and<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.590> go<00:02:26.769> over<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.340> takes<00:02:27.579> it<00:02:27.760> back<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.000> its

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
and I go over it it takes it back to its

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.080 
and I go over it it takes it back to its
previous<00:02:28.930> level<00:02:29.290> okay<00:02:30.280> as<00:02:30.340> its<00:02:30.549> ignoring

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
previous level okay as its ignoring

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.130 
previous level okay as its ignoring
everything<00:02:31.299> else<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.660> I've<00:02:31.750> done<00:02:31.959> and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
everything else that I've done and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.960 
everything else that I've done and
taking<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> back<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.890> how<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.400> originally<00:02:33.880> was

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
taking it back to how it originally was

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.479 
taking it back to how it originally was
and<00:02:34.540> if<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.410> look<00:02:35.620> over<00:02:35.799> here<00:02:35.919> at<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> white

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
and if we look over here at the white

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.009 
and if we look over here at the white
levels<00:02:36.940> you'll<00:02:37.090> see<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.419> in<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.630> white<00:02:37.780> box

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
levels you'll see that in the white box

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.390 
levels you'll see that in the white box
when<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.290> click<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.769> it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
when I click on it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.470 
when I click on it
I've<00:02:39.610> got<00:02:39.849> something<00:02:40.120> that's<00:02:40.239> slightly

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
I've got something that's slightly

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.809 
I've got something that's slightly
purely<00:02:41.019> off-white<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.310> pulled<00:02:42.640> this

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
purely off-white and it's pulled this

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.809 
purely off-white and it's pulled this
slider<00:02:43.120> down<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.599> two<00:02:43.810> three<00:02:44.080> nine<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.700> what

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
slider down to two three nine and what

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.970 
slider down to two three nine and what
it's<00:02:45.940> saying<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:47.170> pixels<00:02:47.590> here<00:02:47.830> were

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
it's saying is that the pixels here were

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.400 
it's saying is that the pixels here were
two<00:02:48.190> three<00:02:48.459> nine<00:02:48.700> therefore<00:02:49.510> every<00:02:49.930> pixel

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
two three nine therefore every pixel

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.190 
two three nine therefore every pixel
that<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.560> two<00:02:50.920> three<00:02:51.280> nine<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.819> above<00:02:52.420> up<00:02:52.959> to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
that is two three nine and above up to

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.660 
that is two three nine and above up to
255<00:02:53.800> has<00:02:54.580> now<00:02:54.819> been<00:02:55.060> pushed<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.599> pure<00:02:55.870> white

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
255 has now been pushed to pure white

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.100 
255 has now been pushed to pure white
okay<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.730> I'll<00:02:57.849> say<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.150> again<00:02:58.420> when<00:02:59.080> I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
okay so I'll say that again when I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.920 
okay so I'll say that again when I
clicked<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.920> collar<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:01.150> pixel<00:03:01.599> value

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
clicked on the collar the pixel value

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.809 
clicked on the collar the pixel value
which<00:03:02.080> was<00:03:02.230> supposed<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.769> be<00:03:02.920> pure<00:03:03.160> white<00:03:03.459> was

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
which was supposed to be pure white was

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.759 
which was supposed to be pure white was
actually<00:03:04.299> not<00:03:04.569> pure<00:03:04.780> white<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.140> was<00:03:05.200> two<00:03:05.440> three

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
actually not pure white it was two three

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.160 
actually not pure white it was two three
nine<00:03:06.099> so<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:06.819> less<00:03:07.180> than<00:03:07.360> pure<00:03:07.569> white<00:03:07.840> and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
nine so it's less than pure white and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.800 
nine so it's less than pure white and
we've<00:03:08.830> said<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.250> Premiere<00:03:09.610> Pro<00:03:09.640> okay<00:03:10.239> every

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
we've said to Premiere Pro okay every

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.960 
we've said to Premiere Pro okay every
pixel<00:03:11.200> value<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.650> as<00:03:12.040> white<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:12.640> shirt

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
pixel value that as white as this shirt

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.440 
pixel value that as white as this shirt
or<00:03:13.209> whiter<00:03:14.069> must<00:03:15.069> be<00:03:15.250> pushed<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:15.880> pure<00:03:16.180> white

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
or whiter must be pushed to pure white

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.270 
or whiter must be pushed to pure white
and<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.780> do<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.620> took<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:18.010> little

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
and to do that it took this little

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.089 
and to do that it took this little
slider<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.910> pulled<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.390> down<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.950> that

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
slider and it pulled it down and that

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.130 
slider and it pulled it down and that
kind<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.549> brightens<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.269> shot<00:03:22.480> up<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.750> bit<00:03:22.930> now

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
kind of brightens the shot up a bit now

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.690 
kind of brightens the shot up a bit now
the<00:03:23.950> black<00:03:24.459> level<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.720> we<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.560> say<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.280> base

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
the black level if we go to say the base

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.400 
the black level if we go to say the base
of<00:03:27.940> this<00:03:28.209> teapot<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:28.930> were<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.110> click<00:03:29.290> at

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
of this teapot and we were to click at

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.319 
of this teapot and we were to click at
the<00:03:29.470> base<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.890> teapot<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.549> was<00:03:30.700> set

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
the base of this teapot and it was set

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.750 
the base of this teapot and it was set
16<00:03:31.870> or<00:03:32.079> something<00:03:32.530> he<00:03:33.040> would<00:03:33.190> say<00:03:33.370> well<00:03:33.549> that's

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
16 or something he would say well that's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.000 
16 or something he would say well that's
supposed<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.390> be<00:03:34.450> pure<00:03:34.780> black<00:03:35.049> therefore<00:03:35.769> all

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
supposed to be pure black therefore all

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.559 
supposed to be pure black therefore all
the<00:03:36.160> pixels<00:03:36.549> that<00:03:36.610> are<00:03:36.760> at<00:03:36.849> that<00:03:37.060> level<00:03:37.269> and

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
the pixels that are at that level and

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.869 
the pixels that are at that level and
below<00:03:37.959> must<00:03:38.769> be<00:03:38.950> pushed<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.340> pure<00:03:39.579> black<00:03:39.849> and

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
below must be pushed to pure black and

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.580 
below must be pushed to pure black and
it<00:03:40.090> does<00:03:40.269> that<00:03:40.450> by<00:03:40.599> pulling<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.019> slider<00:03:41.290> up<00:03:41.500> so

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
it does that by pulling the slider up so

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.460 
it does that by pulling the slider up so
let's<00:03:41.739> just<00:03:41.920> try<00:03:42.069> that<00:03:42.340> let's<00:03:43.000> go<00:03:43.359> to<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.900> really

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
let's just try that let's go to a really

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.870 
let's just try that let's go to a really
black<00:03:44.709> bit<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:45.489> say<00:03:45.760> just<00:03:46.150> there<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:48.459> you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
black bit just say just there now you

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.720 
black bit just say just there now you
can<00:03:49.000> see<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.480> that's<00:03:49.690> actually<00:03:50.049> brown<00:03:50.739> what

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
can see that that's actually brown what

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.490 
can see that that's actually brown what
I've<00:03:51.850> clicked<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.359> was<00:03:52.630> brown<00:03:53.019> but<00:03:53.049> look<00:03:53.410> at

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
I've clicked on was brown but look at

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.620 
I've clicked on was brown but look at
the<00:03:53.560> contrast<00:03:54.069> change<00:03:54.400> it's<00:03:54.609> made<00:03:54.819> it's<00:03:55.450> made

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
the contrast change it's made it's made

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.259 
the contrast change it's made it's made
the<00:03:55.750> whole<00:03:55.959> image<00:03:56.349> a<00:03:56.470> lot<00:03:56.590> darker<00:03:57.220> because<00:03:58.030> it

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
the whole image a lot darker because it

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.509 
the whole image a lot darker because it
said<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.840> brown<00:03:59.349> as<00:03:59.889> it<00:04:00.010> actually<00:04:00.280> was

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
said that the brown as it actually was

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.099 
said that the brown as it actually was
should<00:04:01.180> have<00:04:01.299> been<00:04:01.420> black<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:01.989> it's

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
should have been black and so it's

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.190 
should have been black and so it's
pushed<00:04:02.319> that<00:04:02.500> pixel<00:04:02.859> value<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.849> black<00:04:04.329> now<00:04:05.079> if

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
pushed that pixel value to black now if

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.229 
pushed that pixel value to black now if
it's<00:04:05.349> overdone<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.519> think<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:06.940> too

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
it's overdone and you think it's too

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.270 
it's overdone and you think it's too
much<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.780> could<00:04:08.200> always<00:04:08.380> take<00:04:08.739> these<00:04:08.919> sliders

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
much you could always take these sliders

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.120 
much you could always take these sliders
and<00:04:09.579> pull<00:04:10.000> them<00:04:10.359> back<00:04:10.389> a<00:04:10.630> bit<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.799> that's<00:04:11.980> how

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
and pull them back a bit so that's how

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.970 
and pull them back a bit so that's how
it<00:04:12.190> originally<00:04:12.519> was<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.780> then<00:04:14.049> I<00:04:14.290> clicked<00:04:14.769> in

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
it originally was and then I clicked in

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.620 
it originally was and then I clicked in
there<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.400> pulled<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.000> back<00:04:16.120> off<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.389> it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
there and I pulled it back off and it

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.930 
there and I pulled it back off and it
came<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.169> something<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.820> can

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
came up to something like that you can

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.339 
came up to something like that you can
see<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.269> that's<00:04:19.419> giving<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.810> quite<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.049> big

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
see that that's giving it quite a big

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.170 
see that that's giving it quite a big
contrast<00:04:20.889> change<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.340> darken<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:21.849> image<00:04:22.060> down

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
contrast change it darken the image down

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.719 
contrast change it darken the image down
quite<00:04:22.479> a<00:04:22.510> bit<00:04:22.860> now<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.919> one<00:04:24.220> in<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.460> middle

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
quite a bit now the one in the middle

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.010 
quite a bit now the one in the middle
the<00:04:24.820> reason<00:04:25.060> I'm<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.180> bit<00:04:25.389> skeptical<00:04:25.750> about

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
the reason I'm a bit skeptical about

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.719 
the reason I'm a bit skeptical about
this<00:04:26.169> one<00:04:26.380> is<00:04:26.500> because<00:04:26.710> how<00:04:27.130> do<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.310> define

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
this one is because how do you define

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.300 
this one is because how do you define
what<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.180> absolute<00:04:28.780> gray<00:04:29.190> what's<00:04:30.190> the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
what is absolute gray what's the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.650 
what is absolute gray what's the
difference<00:04:30.669> when<00:04:30.789> I<00:04:30.820> actually<00:04:31.000> click<00:04:31.389> on<00:04:31.419> this

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
difference when I actually click on this

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.390 
difference when I actually click on this
when<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.930> say<00:04:32.139> take<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.770> gray<00:04:32.979> of<00:04:33.039> is<00:04:33.220> here

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
when I say take the gray of is here

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.640 
when I say take the gray of is here
because<00:04:33.520> that's<00:04:33.760> supposed<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.360> be<00:04:34.450> gray<00:04:34.810> it

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
because that's supposed to be gray it

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.810 
because that's supposed to be gray it
can<00:04:35.830> make<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.130> image<00:04:36.340> who<00:04:36.430> actually<00:04:36.550> that's

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
can make the image who actually that's

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.390 
can make the image who actually that's
not<00:04:37.000> too<00:04:37.240> bad<00:04:37.510> but<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.470> was<00:04:38.770> if<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:39.099> actually

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
not too bad but it was if you actually

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.120 
not too bad but it was if you actually
look<00:04:39.520> at<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.669> more<00:04:40.000> Brown<00:04:40.389> than<00:04:40.660> anything<00:04:40.840> else

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
look at it more Brown than anything else

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.650 
look at it more Brown than anything else
and<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.430> actually<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:43.210> reason<00:04:43.360> it's<00:04:43.570> not

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
and this is actually the reason it's not

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.760 
and this is actually the reason it's not
made<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.840> lot<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.080> difference<00:04:44.380> is<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.560> can<00:04:44.680> see

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
made a lot of difference is you can see

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.040 
made a lot of difference is you can see
the<00:04:44.860> values<00:04:45.220> not<00:04:45.400> change<00:04:45.669> much<00:04:45.940> but<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:47.020> can

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
the values not change much but you can

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.200 
the values not change much but you can
make<00:04:47.409> a<00:04:47.440> choice<00:04:47.830> about<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.370> contrast<00:04:48.849> of<00:04:49.030> your

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
make a choice about the contrast of your

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.469 
make a choice about the contrast of your
shot<00:04:49.539> by<00:04:50.200> pulling<00:04:50.919> this<00:04:51.070> slider<00:04:51.400> you've<00:04:52.270> got

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
shot by pulling this slider you've got

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.140 
shot by pulling this slider you've got
your<00:04:52.630> white

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
your white

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.240 
your white
use<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.930> he<00:04:54.020> got<00:04:54.200> your<00:04:54.350> black<00:04:54.590> values<00:04:55.070> which

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
use and he got your black values which

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.790 
use and he got your black values which
has<00:04:55.370> actually<00:04:55.670> made<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.910> shot<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.150> lot<00:04:56.360> crisper

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
has actually made the shot a lot crisper

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.440 
has actually made the shot a lot crisper
notice<00:04:57.800> here<00:04:58.010> on<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.190> RGB<00:04:58.550> parade<00:04:58.880> as<00:04:59.270> well

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
notice here on the RGB parade as well

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.600 
notice here on the RGB parade as well
it's<00:04:59.990> pulled<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.560> color<00:05:00.830> range<00:05:01.130> all<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.400> way

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
it's pulled the color range all the way

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.910 
it's pulled the color range all the way
up<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:01.940> hundred<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.450> down<00:05:02.660> from<00:05:02.900> zero<00:05:03.200> so

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
up to a hundred and down from zero so

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.260 
up to a hundred and down from zero so
we've<00:05:04.040> actually<00:05:04.190> got<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.460> really<00:05:05.030> wide

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
we've actually got a really wide

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.260 
we've actually got a really wide
luminance<00:05:06.020> range<00:05:06.550> inside<00:05:07.550> these<00:05:07.790> colors

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
luminance range inside these colors

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.480 
luminance range inside these colors
which<00:05:08.390> means<00:05:08.630> you've<00:05:08.810> got<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.960> really

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
which means you've got a really

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.250 
which means you've got a really
well-balanced<00:05:10.490> shot<00:05:10.760> now<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:11.930> can<00:05:12.110> also

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
well-balanced shot now that I can also

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.320 
well-balanced shot now that I can also
if<00:05:13.010> I<00:05:13.190> start<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.580> slide<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:13.910> up<00:05:14.090> I'll<00:05:14.210> make

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
if I start to slide this up I'll make

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.520 
if I start to slide this up I'll make
the<00:05:14.420> whole<00:05:14.450> thing<00:05:14.570> lighter<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.260> you'll<00:05:15.380> see

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
the whole thing lighter and you'll see

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.200 
the whole thing lighter and you'll see
that<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.740> pixels<00:05:16.100> in<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.220> middle<00:05:16.430> will<00:05:16.940> start

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
that the pixels in the middle will start

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.910 
that the pixels in the middle will start
to<00:05:17.300> go<00:05:17.420> up<00:05:17.450> I've<00:05:18.140> put<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.560> other<00:05:18.620> way<00:05:18.770> they

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
to go up I've put it the other way they

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.560 
to go up I've put it the other way they
go<00:05:19.070> down<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.580> pull<00:05:19.790> it<00:05:19.880> towards<00:05:20.420> the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
go down so if I pull it towards the

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.750 
go down so if I pull it towards the
white<00:05:20.780> you'll<00:05:21.770> see<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.250> whole<00:05:22.400> thing<00:05:22.610> gets

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
white you'll see the whole thing gets

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.370 
white you'll see the whole thing gets
brighter<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.300> all<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.450> pixels<00:05:23.810> kind<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.110> move

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
brighter and all the pixels kind of move

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.320 
brighter and all the pixels kind of move
up<00:05:24.590> in<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.800> middle<00:05:25.040> if<00:05:25.700> I<00:05:25.940> pull<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.240> the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
up in the middle if I pull it the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.840 
up in the middle if I pull it the
opposite<00:05:26.930> direction<00:05:27.110> pull<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:27.710> down<00:05:28.010> see<00:05:28.820> the

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
opposite direction pull it down see the

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.370 
opposite direction pull it down see the
whole<00:05:29.150> thing<00:05:29.420> gets<00:05:29.600> darker<00:05:30.050> but<00:05:30.170> all<00:05:30.290> the

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
whole thing gets darker but all the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.010 
whole thing gets darker but all the
pixels<00:05:30.920> have<00:05:31.130> been<00:05:31.700> pulled<00:05:32.000> down<00:05:32.120> but<00:05:32.900> I've

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
pixels have been pulled down but I've

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.440 
pixels have been pulled down but I've
still<00:05:33.410> got<00:05:33.650> my<00:05:33.770> white<00:05:34.070> point<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.090> still<00:05:35.330> got

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
still got my white point and I still got

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.170 
still got my white point and I still got
my<00:05:35.570> black<00:05:35.840> point<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:37.100> I've<00:05:37.220> got<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.430> really<00:05:37.760> well

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
my black point so I've got a really well

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.330 
my black point so I've got a really well
contrast<00:05:38.840> shop<00:05:39.200> now<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.650> I've<00:05:39.920> got<00:05:40.100> rid<00:05:40.310> of

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
contrast shop now and I've got rid of

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.560 
contrast shop now and I've got rid of
that<00:05:40.550> color<00:05:41.030> cast

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
that color cast

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.750 
that color cast
so<00:05:42.050> if<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.200> go<00:05:42.350> up<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.710> I<00:05:42.740> just<00:05:42.920> turn<00:05:43.220> off<00:05:43.490> the

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
so if I go up and I just turn off the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.910 
so if I go up and I just turn off the
fast<00:05:43.970> color<00:05:44.240> corrector<00:05:44.660> that's<00:05:45.290> how<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.620> shot

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
fast color corrector that's how the shot

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.730 
fast color corrector that's how the shot
started<00:05:46.430> off<00:05:46.750> and<00:05:47.750> then<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.200> first<00:05:48.470> thing<00:05:48.620> we

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
started off and then the first thing we

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.770 
started off and then the first thing we
did<00:05:48.860> was<00:05:48.980> the<00:05:49.130> white<00:05:49.340> balance<00:05:49.580> and<00:05:49.910> then<00:05:50.600> we

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
did was the white balance and then we

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.270 
did was the white balance and then we
did<00:05:50.930> setting<00:05:51.290> our<00:05:51.440> white<00:05:51.650> points<00:05:51.980> our<00:05:52.070> black

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
did setting our white points our black

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.040 
did setting our white points our black
points<00:05:52.580> in<00:05:52.670> our<00:05:52.760> grey<00:05:52.970> points<00:05:53.360> although<00:05:53.780> we

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
points in our grey points although we

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.870 
points in our grey points although we
fiddled<00:05:54.350> around<00:05:54.410> with<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.770> gray<00:05:54.950> point<00:05:55.190> we

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
fiddled around with a gray point we

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.580 
fiddled around with a gray point we
ended<00:05:55.970> up<00:05:56.180> with<00:05:56.420> that<00:05:56.660> which<00:05:57.230> is<00:05:57.350> a<00:05:57.380> much

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
ended up with that which is a much

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.710 
ended up with that which is a much
better<00:05:57.770> shot<00:05:58.160> but<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.850> can<00:05:59.030> still<00:05:59.300> make<00:05:59.510> a

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
better shot but I can still make a

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.150 
better shot but I can still make a
choice<00:05:59.990> I<00:06:00.170> can<00:06:00.320> still<00:06:00.500> turn<00:06:00.650> around<00:06:00.860> said<00:06:01.010> you

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
choice I can still turn around said you

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
choice I can still turn around said you
know<00:06:01.250> what<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.430> don't<00:06:01.550> think<00:06:01.730> that's<00:06:01.940> bright

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
know what I don't think that's bright

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.150 
know what I don't think that's bright
enough<00:06:02.480> and<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.200> can<00:06:03.380> go<00:06:03.500> in<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:03.740> change<00:06:03.920> say

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
enough and I can go in and change say

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.250 
enough and I can go in and change say
the<00:06:04.280> gamma<00:06:04.490> slider<00:06:04.880> or<00:06:05.480> possibly<00:06:05.840> even<00:06:05.900> move

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
the gamma slider or possibly even move

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.500 
the gamma slider or possibly even move
the<00:06:06.380> white<00:06:06.560> sliders<00:06:07.100> so<00:06:07.670> that's<00:06:07.850> the<00:06:08.000> input

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
the white sliders so that's the input

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.970 
the white sliders so that's the input
levels<00:06:08.840> what<00:06:09.500> output<00:06:10.040> levels<00:06:10.400> about<00:06:10.660> well

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
levels what output levels about well

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.380 
levels what output levels about well
sometimes<00:06:12.980> the<00:06:13.190> broadcast<00:06:13.790> system<00:06:14.210> won't

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
sometimes the broadcast system won't

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.770 
sometimes the broadcast system won't
cope<00:06:14.780> with<00:06:15.020> pure<00:06:15.350> black<00:06:15.650> or<00:06:15.860> pure<00:06:16.100> white<00:06:16.660> so<00:06:17.660> at

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
cope with pure black or pure white so at

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.540 
cope with pure black or pure white so at
the<00:06:17.900> moment<00:06:18.110> what's<00:06:18.560> happening<00:06:19.100> is<00:06:19.250> we're

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
the moment what's happening is we're

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.330 
the moment what's happening is we're
saying<00:06:19.790> that<00:06:20.000> from<00:06:20.570> 22.1<00:06:21.560> this<00:06:21.800> slider<00:06:22.100> is<00:06:22.220> at

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
saying that from 22.1 this slider is at

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.700 
saying that from 22.1 this slider is at
twenty<00:06:22.640> two<00:06:22.820> point<00:06:23.030> one<00:06:23.240> so<00:06:23.840> every<00:06:24.170> pixel<00:06:24.380> with

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
twenty two point one so every pixel with

a value of twenty two point one down to

a value of twenty two point one down to
zero

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680

has<00:06:28.130> been<00:06:28.310> pushed<00:06:28.640> to<00:06:28.790> pure<00:06:29.000> black<00:06:29.030> and<00:06:29.450> will

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
has been pushed to pure black and will

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.230 
has been pushed to pure black and will
be<00:06:29.630> output<00:06:29.870> to<00:06:30.200> pure<00:06:30.410> black<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:31.000> output<00:06:32.000> the

be output to pure black and output the
pure<00:06:32.480> black<00:06:32.660> is<00:06:32.930> zero<00:06:33.880> but<00:06:34.880> as<00:06:35.030> I<00:06:35.150> say<00:06:35.300> some

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
pure black is zero but as I say some

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.810 
pure black is zero but as I say some
broadcast<00:06:36.290> systems<00:06:36.680> won't<00:06:36.860> cope<00:06:37.250> with<00:06:37.550> pure

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
broadcast systems won't cope with pure

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.300 
broadcast systems won't cope with pure
black<00:06:38.200> so<00:06:39.200> you<00:06:39.260> can<00:06:39.440> say<00:06:39.650> okay<00:06:40.010> well<00:06:40.100> if<00:06:40.220> it

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
black so you can say okay well if it

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.580 
black so you can say okay well if it
won't<00:06:40.520> cope<00:06:40.820> with<00:06:41.030> pure<00:06:41.240> black<00:06:41.510> we<00:06:42.140> can<00:06:42.320> pull

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
won't cope with pure black we can pull

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.300 
won't cope with pure black we can pull
this<00:06:42.830> up<00:06:43.040> to<00:06:43.340> say<00:06:43.580> sixteen<00:06:44.980> now<00:06:45.980> some

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
this up to say sixteen now some

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.010 
this up to say sixteen now some
broadcast<00:06:46.790> systems<00:06:47.150> I<00:06:47.270> say<00:06:47.420> need<00:06:47.660> it<00:06:47.780> to<00:06:47.900> be

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
broadcast systems I say need it to be

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.690 
broadcast systems I say need it to be
something<00:06:48.380> like<00:06:48.560> sixteen<00:06:49.160> before<00:06:49.550> they're

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
something like sixteen before they're

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.280 
something like sixteen before they're
actually<00:06:49.820> coping<00:06:50.330> it<00:06:50.420> will<00:06:50.540> be<00:06:50.690> legal<00:06:51.110> so

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
actually coping it will be legal so

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.440 
actually coping it will be legal so
although<00:06:52.130> I've<00:06:52.370> got<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.640> input<00:06:52.820> side<00:06:53.300> of

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
although I've got the input side of

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.720 
although I've got the input side of
things<00:06:53.660> sorted<00:06:53.960> out<00:06:54.110> the<00:06:54.800> system<00:06:55.190> can't<00:06:55.490> cope

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
things sorted out the system can't cope

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.790 
things sorted out the system can't cope
with<00:06:55.760> pure<00:06:56.150> black<00:06:56.390> so<00:06:56.900> I<00:06:56.930> pull<00:06:57.200> the<00:06:57.230> slider<00:06:57.470> up

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
with pure black so I pull the slider up

with pure black so I pull the slider up
likewise<00:06:58.670> I've<00:06:59.000> got<00:06:59.810> my<00:06:59.960> whites<00:07:00.260> from<00:07:00.650> two

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
likewise I've got my whites from two

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.070 
likewise I've got my whites from two
three<00:07:01.250> nine<00:07:01.460> up<00:07:01.670> to<00:07:01.790> 255<00:07:02.300> they're<00:07:02.570> all<00:07:02.690> pure

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
three nine up to 255 they're all pure

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.900 
three nine up to 255 they're all pure
white<00:07:03.320> and<00:07:03.740> at<00:07:03.980> the<00:07:04.100> moment<00:07:04.430> all<00:07:04.550> of<00:07:04.580> them<00:07:04.790> will

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
white and at the moment all of them will

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.879 
white and at the moment all of them will
show<00:07:05.150> us<00:07:05.300> 255<00:07:05.990> but<00:07:06.620> if

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889 
show us 255 but if

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.459 
show us 255 but if
sister<00:07:07.280> won't<00:07:07.430> cope<00:07:07.729> with<00:07:07.999> pure<00:07:08.330> white<00:07:08.539> I<00:07:08.870> can

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
sister won't cope with pure white I can

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.649 
sister won't cope with pure white I can
pull<00:07:09.650> the<00:07:09.770> output<00:07:10.039> slider<00:07:10.550> down<00:07:10.819> and<00:07:10.879> all<00:07:11.539> of

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:11.659 
pull the output slider down and all of

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.029 
pull the output slider down and all of
those<00:07:11.749> will<00:07:11.930> be<00:07:12.020> mapped<00:07:12.229> to<00:07:12.319> a<00:07:12.409> darker<00:07:12.740> level

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 
those will be mapped to a darker level

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.850 
those will be mapped to a darker level
now<00:07:13.909> I<00:07:14.060> don't<00:07:14.419> often<00:07:14.659> play<00:07:15.020> with<00:07:15.259> the<00:07:15.319> output

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
now I don't often play with the output

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.040 
now I don't often play with the output
levels<00:07:16.430> although<00:07:16.879> I<00:07:17.029> do<00:07:17.120> occasionally<00:07:17.900> when

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
levels although I do occasionally when

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.899 
levels although I do occasionally when
something's<00:07:18.409> perhaps<00:07:18.800> a<00:07:19.009> little<00:07:19.400> bit<00:07:19.639> blown

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:19.909 
something's perhaps a little bit blown

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:22.719 
something's perhaps a little bit blown
out<00:07:20.150> in<00:07:20.330> one<00:07:20.509> color<00:07:20.779> channel<00:07:21.169> but<00:07:22.099> I<00:07:22.129> do<00:07:22.279> play

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:22.729 
out in one color channel but I do play

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.119 
out in one color channel but I do play
the<00:07:22.759> input<00:07:23.270> sliders<00:07:23.659> a<00:07:23.689> great<00:07:24.139> deal<00:07:24.409> this<00:07:25.069> is

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:25.129 
the input sliders a great deal this is

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:28.179 
the input sliders a great deal this is
the<00:07:25.460> equivalent<00:07:26.120> to<00:07:26.960> levels<00:07:27.590> in<00:07:27.860> After

00:07:28.179 --> 00:07:28.189 
the equivalent to levels in After

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:30.489 
the equivalent to levels in After
Effects<00:07:28.490> there<00:07:29.120> is<00:07:29.389> actually<00:07:30.080> a<00:07:30.110> levels

00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:30.499 
Effects there is actually a levels

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:32.769 
Effects there is actually a levels
effect<00:07:30.860> in<00:07:31.069> Premiere<00:07:31.610> Pro<00:07:31.639> but<00:07:32.029> it<00:07:32.150> is<00:07:32.360> very

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:32.779 
effect in Premiere Pro but it is very

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:35.080 
effect in Premiere Pro but it is very
difficult<00:07:32.960> to<00:07:33.199> use<00:07:33.469> I<00:07:33.770> will<00:07:34.430> demonstrate<00:07:34.669> it<00:07:35.060> a

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.090 
difficult to use I will demonstrate it a

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.339 
difficult to use I will demonstrate it a
bit<00:07:35.210> later<00:07:35.389> on<00:07:35.509> but<00:07:35.629> it's<00:07:35.840> not<00:07:35.990> a<00:07:36.020> particularly

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:36.349 
bit later on but it's not a particularly

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:39.040 
bit later on but it's not a particularly
easy<00:07:36.620> effect<00:07:37.189> to<00:07:37.279> use<00:07:37.520> so<00:07:38.270> this<00:07:38.449> is<00:07:38.599> kind<00:07:38.930> of

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050 
easy effect to use so this is kind of

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.050 
easy effect to use so this is kind of
like<00:07:39.199> the<00:07:39.349> levels<00:07:39.770> effect<00:07:39.889> and<00:07:40.340> it<00:07:40.819> really

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060 
like the levels effect and it really

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.999 
like the levels effect and it really
helps<00:07:41.449> you<00:07:41.629> to<00:07:41.659> get<00:07:42.139> your<00:07:42.289> shot<00:07:42.590> from<00:07:42.800> being

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:43.009 
helps you to get your shot from being

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:46.450 
helps you to get your shot from being
quite<00:07:43.279> gray<00:07:44.180> to<00:07:44.900> being<00:07:45.289> well<00:07:45.500> contrast<00:07:46.159> and

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460 
quite gray to being well contrast and

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.219 
quite gray to being well contrast and
having<00:07:46.789> a<00:07:46.849> good<00:07:47.090> decision<00:07:47.539> about<00:07:47.629> how<00:07:47.960> bright

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:48.229 
having a good decision about how bright

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:51.339 
having a good decision about how bright
or<00:07:48.259> dark<00:07:48.620> it<00:07:48.830> is<00:07:48.919> in<00:07:49.250> the<00:07:50.060> next<00:07:50.270> tutorial<00:07:51.050> what

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:51.349 
or dark it is in the next tutorial what

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:52.779 
or dark it is in the next tutorial what
we're<00:07:51.500> going<00:07:51.620> to<00:07:51.650> do<00:07:51.860> is<00:07:52.069> we're<00:07:52.250> going<00:07:52.460> to<00:07:52.550> deal

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:52.789 
we're going to do is we're going to deal

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:55.300 
we're going to do is we're going to deal
with<00:07:52.939> the<00:07:53.060> skin<00:07:53.479> tones<00:07:54.009> so<00:07:55.009> we're<00:07:55.129> going<00:07:55.250> to

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.310 
with the skin tones so we're going to

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.040 
with the skin tones so we're going to
make<00:07:55.430> sure<00:07:55.639> that<00:07:55.789> this<00:07:55.939> man's<00:07:56.240> skin<00:07:56.569> tone<00:07:56.840> is

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.050 
make sure that this man's skin tone is

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.899 
make sure that this man's skin tone is
correct<00:07:57.529> and<00:07:58.339> we're<00:07:58.430> going<00:07:58.580> to<00:07:58.639> use<00:07:58.789> the

00:07:58.899 --> 00:07:58.909 
correct and we're going to use the

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.189 
correct and we're going to use the
vectorscope<00:07:59.270> and<00:07:59.719> we're<00:07:59.900> going<00:08:00.020> to<00:08:00.080> use

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 
vectorscope and we're going to use

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:02.709 
vectorscope and we're going to use
another<00:08:00.560> instance<00:08:01.159> of<00:08:01.400> the<00:08:02.120> fast<00:08:02.419> color

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:02.719 
another instance of the fast color

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:07.159 
another instance of the fast color
corrector
