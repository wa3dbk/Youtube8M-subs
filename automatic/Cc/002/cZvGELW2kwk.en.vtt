00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.460 

quite<00:04:18.880> such<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.240> have<00:04:22.470> support

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
quite such there you have support

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.310 
quite such there you have support
somewhere<00:04:24.420> down<00:04:25.420> to<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.630> lower<00:04:25.810> level<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.170> the

somewhere down to the lower level to the
fire<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.700> can<00:04:27.850> cook<00:04:28.030> like<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.500> damper<00:04:29.500> on

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
fire so you can cook like a damper on

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.520 
fire so you can cook like a damper on
your<00:04:29.860> pant<00:04:30.160> oven<00:04:31.050> boiler<00:04:32.050> Billy<00:04:32.230> with<00:04:32.440> the
