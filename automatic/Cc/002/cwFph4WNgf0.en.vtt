00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 not good or not that it was a truth is 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.660
 what was it that you repeat yourself late 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.910
 TV situation but this was 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.359
 I was sure you were going to take care of me and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.830
 all the people of argentina were going to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.519
 treat well I did not want to leave the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.519
 tele because 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:33.100
 I want to play football I repeat that 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.970
 you're going to play you a question 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.970
 sorry for his decision 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.490
 I do not take care to tell me 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.990
 sorry not 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.350
 do not make sense 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.250
 but 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.690
 but I want to clarify that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.690
 that was my decision 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.719
 look 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.690
 the length of the story but knowing 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.390
 that in the part of television the part 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.049
 of my program I was only going to do the only thing 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.850
 what I was going to do is charity there is a 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.190
 part of forest regrets having 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.690
 made that decision or really follow 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.620
 with the same idea again come to 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.490
 Argentina 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.600
 clearly me 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.600
 I thought a lot 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.000
 lost my dreams always outside 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.000
 Andean 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.770
 but 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.340
 to repeat or not 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.410
 and in the future something comes out 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.850
 find something I'm going to evaluate but in 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 this moment I do not ask you again if 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.440
 he was already locked up that judge for the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.950
 future that really unfortunately 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.110
 LuÃ­s Ventura ran out of a player and 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.800
 I'm trying everything for you to be in the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.720
 future 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.119
 then you were going to play in a box 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.760
 Argentine was stronger the detail of the 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.590
 fear here are you going to do in my program to 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 what you want to do that play in a 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.760
 Argentine box 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.740
 fear was if you can talk about fear 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.200
 television in general 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.390
 good but you know that television in 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.580
 general is going to happen this takes this 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.050
 West week of any country because 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.030
 that got rid of vigo armando maradona 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.340
 then where you play and more if 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.890
 You're in this country, it's me 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.570
 I hired later you want any 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.490
 that I hired you the day you want or 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.770
 you decide to come here television and 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.120
 You will have the same press and all the 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.210
 harassment of the press will be equal 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.290
 so this is something I 'm going to know 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.290
 because that is the son of maradona 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.849
 for me the different theme 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.849
 if I have television but 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.129
 I did not want 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.319
 to do things like that 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.510
 go ahead they said to you you think 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.870
 to do charity is to be obliged to 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.870
 something 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.380
 without talking to schools identities help 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.030
 I think that's not something that 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.440
 may feel as an obligation I believe that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.990
 maybe I will not do it with my heart 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.000
 I do it too 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.310
 Well, how did you do it in Italy? 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.010
 same I felt that I was going to do it with 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.830
 All our heart we have Luis Ventura 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.830
 online now I also visit 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.390
 note 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.549
 ends closing in the explanation of 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.829
 diego and I know that diego is listening to me 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.480
 because when he gives his first 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.459
 explanation of why it does not come what 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.409
 first thing that says is that the contract that 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.840
 you send him they had nothing to do 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.269
 with the agreement is to say he does not say 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.639
 scared the television says the contract 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.409
 that they sent me was not what was agreed and a 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.480
 little loses the ball you say 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.280
 is now like changing the version not 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.640
 I know how we lived it I did this this 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.920
 explanation that gives us diego sr 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.340
 the future did not send him any contracts 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.340
 others 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.650
 then it would be good to diego 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.550
 clarify what he meant with those tweets 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.919
 where he said that the contract did not respond 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.680
 marine variety state I'll tell you 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.419
 one thing I go through life trying to 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 do things well I'm a man of 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.260
 goodwill I'm a decent guy I'm 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.840
 an honest guy we do not know all the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.090
 old men and me 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.000
 I diego and I know what we are talking about 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.540
 between us I know what I did for 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.640
 diego was Argentina 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.710
 but I did not do it this time what 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.300
 I did in others I did also when 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.760
 be part of the production of 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.160
 paparazzi on TV with production of 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.280
 marcelo tinelli I did it later more 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.920
 late when diego 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.860
 Diego was sinagra still and he was 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.300
 renegade the Argentine media I did 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.980
 a lot of things for the kid 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.950
 tell your story 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.419
 I when I talked to him what I 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.160
 it hurt at the time was that he said that 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.790
 he only spoke twice with me he knows that 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.550
 It was not like that, I do not want to load inks 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.070
 I want to blame, I have the best 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.440
 feeling sorry i lost 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.330
 let's say this opportunity to show 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.830
 here in Argentina because I think that 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.500
 would have been a good platform for 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.419
 take off for him and to show that he 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.669
 as a player it serves to demonstrate 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.010
 also his love and his love for his 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.960
 family and to prove that maybe 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.870
 Tomorrow in some opportunity 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.610
 you can join with your blood that 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.090
 was what I tried to promote simply 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.890
 from a humble austere place without 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.620
 no pretense other than to say 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.330
 to do good to diego armando maradona 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.610
 do well to the future and also 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.860
 favor the business part that I 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.840
 facilitated ricardo fort that was my only 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.560
 intention I do not have any resquemor 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.120
 I have no hatred any grudges no 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.880
 it came out did not come out yes 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.830
 if I tell you that in the future, on time 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.910
 it is detrimental to our 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.040
 movement promptly because that square 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.290
 write it could there be the 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.790
 I could have covered with another player 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.979
 banked with what I have and I love them 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.380
 to say today the future is the only 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.270
 pointer of the divisional because today 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.340
 tied in all the rest of those that what 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.900
 they were still lost and it was as unique 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.340
 pointer that is the team I was going to 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.610
 come diego armando maradona 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.610
 lost 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.120
 louis listening and what is I saying also 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.740
 to me what I would like to know more than 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.050
 nothing diego if the decision not to come 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.639
 was absolutely yours or if someone from 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.919
 your family environment influenced that in 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.370
 definitively you say no I'm not going to the 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.370
 Argentina 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:54.489
 that's the biggest madness you hear 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:07:01.039
 how could they threaten 

00:06:54.489 --> 00:07:04.779
 maybe advise and tell you things and 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.779
 they talked about threats 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:09.739
 One thing because they are ready was very 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.419
 logical here you have a country that is 

00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:12.769
 receiving that you have a businessman like 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.309
 me that is banking you so that you 

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:15.309
 come to the country
