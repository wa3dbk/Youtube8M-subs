00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
because you know she's been in love with

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.550 
because you know she's been in love with
him<00:04:39.729> forever<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.570> they<00:04:41.139> grew<00:04:41.289> up<00:04:41.380> together

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
him forever and they grew up together

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.469 
him forever and they grew up together
and<00:04:41.949> partly<00:04:42.280> because<00:04:42.340> he's<00:04:42.669> really<00:04:42.940> good<00:04:43.449> I

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
and partly because he's really good I

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.779 
and partly because he's really good I
mean<00:04:43.630> he's<00:04:43.840> just<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.289> master<00:04:44.770> manipulator<00:04:45.159> and

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
mean he's just a master manipulator and

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.180 
mean he's just a master manipulator and
so<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.930> plays<00:04:47.110> out<00:04:47.380> as<00:04:47.590> if<00:04:47.710> it's<00:04:47.860> going<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.099> be

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
so it plays out as if it's going to be

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.710 
so it plays out as if it's going to be
another<00:04:48.370> one<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.610> those<00:04:48.789> times<00:04:49.030> where<00:04:49.330> he<00:04:49.479> no

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
kind of think like that's that's how

kind of think like that's that's how
it's<00:04:58.210> going<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.630> end

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
it's going to end

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.070
