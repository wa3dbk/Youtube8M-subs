neck I mean the ipad pro in this last

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.190 
neck I mean the ipad pro in this last
sentence<00:01:42.240> yeah<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> does<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.020> so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
sentence yeah it does because it's so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960 
sentence yeah it does because it's so
much<00:01:43.350> bigger<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.729> it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
much bigger it's gonna be I think it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.160 
much bigger it's gonna be I think it's
be<00:01:45.060> very<00:01:45.299> close<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> computing<00:01:45.930> experience

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
be very close to computing experience

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170 
be very close to computing experience
because<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.250> some<00:01:47.579> photos<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.119> been

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
because there are some photos have been

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
because there are some photos have been
leaked<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.780> cases<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.500> show<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> has

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
leaked up some cases that show that has

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.859 
leaked up some cases that show that has
two<00:01:50.310> ports<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.329> bottom<00:01:51.630> where<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
two ports from the bottom where you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
two ports from the bottom where you
would<00:01:51.990> charge<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.680> also<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> side<00:01:53.490> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
would charge it and also on the side of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
would charge it and also on the side of
it<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> them's<00:01:54.930> probably<00:01:54.990> gonna<00:01:55.259> be

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it and one of them's probably gonna be

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
it and one of them's probably gonna be
charging<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> Lightning<00:01:56.759> port

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
charging with like the Lightning port

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
charging with like the Lightning port
and<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.090> open<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.509> could<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> USBC<00:01:58.560> port

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and the open one could be a USBC port

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
and the open one could be a USBC port
made<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.430> feel<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.790> keyboard<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> adding

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
made you feel like a keyboard is adding

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.530 
made you feel like a keyboard is adding
more<00:02:01.049> portable<00:02:01.560> yeah<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.369> look<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.149> leak

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
more portable yeah so look like the leak

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.070 
more portable yeah so look like the leak
cases<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:04.259> suggested

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
cases have suggested

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.440 
cases have suggested
that<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.670> lightning<00:02:06.670> port<00:02:06.790> in<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:06.940> bottom<00:02:07.300> but

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
that a lightning port in the bottom but

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.780 
that a lightning port in the bottom but
an<00:02:07.570> USB<00:02:08.020> type-c<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.710> side<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:09.640> means

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
an USB type-c on the side so that means

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.280 
an USB type-c on the side so that means
that<00:02:10.000> Apple<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.420> probably<00:02:10.720> going<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.050> sell

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
that Apple is probably going to sell

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.890 
that Apple is probably going to sell
some<00:02:11.740> keyboard<00:02:12.490> docks<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.570> put<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
some keyboard docks so you just put the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.860 
some keyboard docks so you just put the
ipad<00:02:14.170> pro<00:02:14.350> in<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.650> dock<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.210> use<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.390> as<00:02:16.480> a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
ipad pro in a dock and use it as a

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.500 
ipad pro in a dock and use it as a
laptop<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.980> ipad<00:02:18.280> pro<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.520> give<00:02:18.760> me<00:02:18.790> four

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
laptop so the ipad pro is give me four

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.540 
laptop so the ipad pro is give me four
more<00:02:19.690> productivity<00:02:20.290> I'm<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.190> that's<00:02:21.340> why<00:02:21.490> it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
more productivity I'm so that's why it

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.460 
more productivity I'm so that's why it
definitely<00:02:21.970> could<00:02:22.210> replace<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:23.050> aging

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
definitely could replace the aging

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.320 
definitely could replace the aging
macbook<00:02:23.890> air<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.940> think<00:02:25.030> this

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
macbook air and really I think this

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.730 
macbook air and really I think this
would<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.600> good<00:02:25.810> step<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.260> Apple<00:02:26.470> because

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
would be a good step for Apple because

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.010 
would be a good step for Apple because
their<00:02:27.210> iPads<00:02:28.210> really<00:02:28.570> haven't<00:02:28.810> been<00:02:28.840> doing

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
their iPads really haven't been doing

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.300 
their iPads really haven't been doing
the<00:02:29.200> greatest<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.680> recent<00:02:29.980> years<00:02:30.010> they've

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
the greatest in recent years they've

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.650 
the greatest in recent years they've
been<00:02:30.640> decreasing<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.510> like

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
been decreasing because of like

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.330 
been decreasing because of like
Samsung's<00:02:32.230> happen<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.620> count<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:33.010> maybe<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
Samsung's happen to count out maybe the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.250 
Samsung's happen to count out maybe the
Nexus<00:02:33.790> they've<00:02:34.330> all<00:02:34.450> been<00:02:34.600> doing<00:02:34.840> very<00:02:34.870> good

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
Nexus they've all been doing very good

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.870 
Nexus they've all been doing very good
in<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.470> iPad<00:02:35.800> really<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.280> stayed<00:02:36.490> word<00:02:36.670> as

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
in the iPad really just stayed word as

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.550 
in the iPad really just stayed word as
and<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.360> has<00:02:37.480> gotten<00:02:37.750> pretty<00:02:37.780> much<00:02:38.170> thinner

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
and just has gotten pretty much thinner

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.350 
and just has gotten pretty much thinner
and<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.430> iPad<00:02:39.940> pro<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:42.240> basically<00:02:43.240> going

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
and so this iPad pro is basically going

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.420 
and so this iPad pro is basically going
to<00:02:43.480> compete<00:02:43.840> with<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.290> mic<00:02:44.770> rough<00:02:45.010> surface

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
to compete with the mic rough surface

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.340 
to compete with the mic rough surface
pro<00:02:45.700> yeah<00:02:45.970> that's<00:02:46.270> kind<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.690> what's<00:02:46.990> meant<00:02:47.260> to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
pro yeah that's kind of what's meant to

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.800 
pro yeah that's kind of what's meant to
do<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.550> guess<00:02:48.730> also<00:02:49.030> kind<00:02:49.240> of<00:02:49.300> replace<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
do and I guess also kind of replace the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.110 
do and I guess also kind of replace the
macbook<00:02:50.110> air<00:02:50.290> too<00:02:50.530> yeah<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.640> way<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> kind

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
macbook air too yeah and the way I kind

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.110 
macbook air too yeah and the way I kind
of<00:02:52.180> seed<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.990> new<00:02:53.220> iPad<00:02:54.220> pro<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.760> kind

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
of seed is that the new iPad pro is kind

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.140 
of seed is that the new iPad pro is kind
of<00:02:55.270> um<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.350> touch<00:02:56.709> display<00:02:57.430> equivalent<00:02:58.000> of

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
of um the touch display equivalent of

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.820 
of um the touch display equivalent of
the<00:02:58.360> macbook<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.140> if<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.500> macbook

next-gen<00:03:18.160> cpu<00:03:18.700> yeah<00:03:19.060> probably<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.540> three

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
next-gen cpu yeah probably like three

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.320 
next-gen cpu yeah probably like three

speed bump over the ipad air 2 that
exists<00:03:26.590> now<00:03:26.769> probably<00:03:27.100> two<00:03:27.370> gigabytes<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.850> ram

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060

on<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.300> inside<00:03:28.830> three<00:03:29.830> would<00:03:30.010> be<00:03:30.040> ideal

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
on the inside three would be ideal

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.130 
on the inside three would be ideal
especially<00:03:31.000> with<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.209> dual<00:03:31.420> window<00:03:31.540> mode<00:03:31.870> but

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
especially with the dual window mode but

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.100 
especially with the dual window mode but
