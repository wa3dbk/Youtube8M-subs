00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
which is a mechanical puffle and I was

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590 
which is a mechanical puffle and I was
going<00:00:38.040> through<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> lot<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> images<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> it

someone to make this video and they may

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
someone to make this video and they may
actual<00:01:21.900> sounds<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> puffle<00:01:23.100> would

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
actual sounds to what the puffle would

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310 
actual sounds to what the puffle would
sound<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> game<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.170> for

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
sound like if it was in the game so for

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
sound like if it was in the game so for
example<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.890> own<00:01:26.220> sound<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
example there is own sound of it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.940 
example there is own sound of it
starting<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.869> there's<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> sound<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
starting up there's a sound of it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.030 
starting up there's a sound of it
powering<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.990> also<00:01:30.990> short-circuiting<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
powering down also short-circuiting so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
powering down also short-circuiting so
I'm<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.700> gonna<00:01:32.790> play<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
I'm not gonna play it just because I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.690 
I'm not gonna play it just because I
don't<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:34.079> computer<00:01:35.040> audio<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.520> right

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
don't have my computer audio on right

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.730 
don't have my computer audio on right
now<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.960> something<00:01:37.439> that's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
now but I think it's something that's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830 
now but I think it's something that's
quite<00:01:38.430> notable<00:01:38.820> by<00:01:39.000> these<00:01:39.210> guys<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.689> amount

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
quite notable by these guys the amount

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
quite notable by these guys the amount
of<00:01:39.900> effort<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> as

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
of effort that they put in to do this as

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
of effort that they put in to do this as

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
back in what was it June 2012 when we

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.800 
back in what was it June 2012 when we
had<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.610> battle<00:02:54.910> like<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.180> really<00:02:55.450> really

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
had to battle like that really really

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.900 
had to battle like that really really
big<00:02:56.019> robot<00:02:56.380> during<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.070> Marvel<00:02:57.400> superhero

big robot during the Marvel superhero
party<00:02:58.120> that's<00:02:58.780> kind<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.110> like<00:02:59.200> what<00:02:59.350> they<00:02:59.470> say

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
party that's kind of like what they say

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.100 
party that's kind of like what they say
is<00:02:59.680> accepting<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.550> puffle<00:03:01.090> version<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.840> think

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
is accepting a puffle version so I think

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.530 
is accepting a puffle version so I think
the<00:03:02.800> thought<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.459> pretty<00:03:03.880> cool<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
the thought of it is pretty cool and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.840 
the thought of it is pretty cool and
although<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.739> may<00:03:05.860> not<00:03:05.890> make<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.549> game

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
although it may not make it to the game

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.789 
although it may not make it to the game
I<00:03:07.090> kind<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.660> want<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.989> support<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.470> paints

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
I kind of want to support the paints

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.440 
I kind of want to support the paints
seeing<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.430> how<00:03:09.549> much<00:03:09.700> effort<00:03:09.940> was<00:03:10.030> put<00:03:10.090> into

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
seeing is how much effort was put into

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.420 
seeing is how much effort was put into
it<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.200> fact<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.709> really<00:03:12.100> do<00:03:12.220> like

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
it and the fact that I really do like

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.170 
it and the fact that I really do like
the<00:03:12.580> idea<00:03:13.110> altogether<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.370> if<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.760> guys<00:03:15.880> want

go ahead and check out this page I
really<00:03:19.000> do<00:03:19.209> think<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.600> we<00:03:19.720> deserve<00:03:20.080> some

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
really do think that we deserve some
