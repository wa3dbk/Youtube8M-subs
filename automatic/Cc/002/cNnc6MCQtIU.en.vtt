00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
the confines of the engine space they

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.070 
the confines of the engine space they
give<00:06:35.319> you<00:06:35.469> you're<00:06:36.159> doing<00:06:36.370> real<00:06:36.580> well<00:06:37.080> that's

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
give you you're doing real well that's

give you you're doing real well that's
not<00:06:38.229> easy<00:06:39.210> that<00:06:40.210> runs<00:06:41.400> there<00:06:42.400> is<00:06:42.490> water<00:06:42.699> in<00:06:42.879> the

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:42.969 
not easy that runs there is water in the

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.670 
not easy that runs there is water in the
reservoir<00:06:43.060> but<00:06:43.599> I<00:06:43.779> think<00:06:44.020> it's<00:06:44.139> only<00:06:44.259> set<00:06:44.529> up

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
reservoir but I think it's only set up

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.369 
reservoir but I think it's only set up
head<00:06:45.189> level<00:06:45.430> just<00:06:46.419> using<00:06:46.689> convection<00:06:47.199> at<00:06:47.319> the

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:47.379 
head level just using convection at the

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:52.260 
head level just using convection at the
moment<00:06:48.180> but<00:06:49.180> yeah<00:06:49.599> she<00:06:50.590> still<00:06:50.740> works<00:06:51.210> now<00:06:52.210> to

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
moment but yeah she still works now to

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.800 
moment but yeah she still works now to
find<00:06:52.539> somewhere<00:06:52.779> to<00:06:52.870> put<00:06:53.050> it<00:06:53.169> hmm<00:06:54.629> making<00:06:55.629> room
