00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.480
 short but far-reaching for me 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.580
 notice that is from 1 February I will 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.640
 enter into employment with fc twente 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 very difficult to combine with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.850
 cambuur 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.939
 so i go i can leave now and also per 1 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.630
 February to join it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.000
 board of fc twente fc twente will be one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 one-tier board with one 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 seven-member boards in which two 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 will say excecutive and one of will 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.329
 being me 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.219
 with the financial paddle while cfo and 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.020
 it all goes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.129
 disadvantages transformation of that structure that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 will be a February final 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.500
 means that I am therefore behind me 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.489
 left after more than five and a half years that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 have been difficult difficult 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.629
 moment must be fair the choice to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 for me it is not difficult for twente 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.049
 trend is a top club in my 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.049
 province 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.840
 i think i will call a nice sequel to my 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.460
 my career so far to five 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.119
 cluppie a few years ago 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 champion so I think in every 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.049
 everything a big club and proud of me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.930
 my son's club when we go but it is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.070
 not an easy choice because I have it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.299
 just waste good to my liking 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.909
 leeuwarden 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.049
 we have a great period behind 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.770
 the back 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.109
 there are in the momentum of one 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.369
 the club where it is great 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.810
 that is very nice to be part of 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.179
 to make 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.840
 we come from far away then it is nice too 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:53.409
 in order to take these moments with you 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.329
 dealing with the club but at the same time 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.069
 a certain form of it also arises 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.770
 saturation 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.409
 everything we had in mind was what I felt 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.729
 posed six years ago that is almost 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.950
 almost 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.080
 realizes a great pity for that 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.209
 cambuur of course but a fantastic one 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.459
 step for you I think 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.269
 yes absolutely i leave a great club 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.630
 behind 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.180
 so that feeling is whole 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.709
 2 2 warrior but also great club to 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.349
 to go so a very nice step 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.079
 was a difficult decision for you to 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.670
 the cells of i go cambuur after more than five 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.959
 and left half a year 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.239
 well the decision was not difficult because 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.340
 what i say i thought twente was such 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.380
 opportunity and such a club that that on 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.120
 my list was from van to things 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.840
 which I would like to do and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.400
 top club 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.280
 and then also a club that suits me 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.000
 the neighborhood comes so that decision was 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.930
 not difficult 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 but 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.960
 if you make that decision then make it 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.450
 that you release a lot and that 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.350
 that was very difficult yes because we 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.300
 the net already belonged to him 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.910
 press conference your rating yes i am real 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.380
 front neighborhood in recent years and 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.430
 maybe it will always be that way 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.440
 stay 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.970
 yes after i get the benefit of on this 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.050
 way I think in history 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.700
 from cambuur that is not very much 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.020
 directors by the for the outside 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.840
 went 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.300
 so i can come in here for the next 20 years 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.620
 leeuwarden walking around with one on one 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.510
 good way i have a lot of friends 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.980
 made in leeuwarden i have a lot 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.260
 gained knowledge 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.730
 I am I am very proud of this club 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.870
 and then what we are all here 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.790
 have achieved 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.070
 that's what water you so that you 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.330
 leave and of course you have a lot 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.750
 experienced a lot 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.390
 You have already achieved your goals 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.730
 well if i like you i go a bit 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.130
 but has succeeded a lot and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.650
 the last step is the new stadium 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.470
 that is the the missing link before the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.000
 future and I hope that one day 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.560
 just before I leave that works because 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.850
 in January we met with the municipality 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.290
 agreed then we go there one 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.930
 decision moment in forcing 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.270
 so i fervently hope that that will be my last 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.900
 job becomes in leeuwarden and and if that 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.280
 succeeds 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.250
 yes then i'm perfectly happy 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.910
 been leeuwarden again from 1 February 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.550
 left 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.720
 b the transfer period will come 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.090
 at 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.230
 yes and we have this mass of keyser we 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.930
 already had the organization 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.580
 recent years it boasted that 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.950
 dependence on me was already a lot 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.600
 less large and from the count who 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.180
 just remains massively just so 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.440
 I'm not so worried about that 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.450
 I am 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.460
 just in service until 1 February 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.870
 from cambuur and also the after i will be there 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.450
 where necessary 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.540
 be employable so I just want it 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.070
 very good closure here and yes it 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.320
 preferably with a new stadium 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.940
 in principle , art is going to take over 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.070
 yours are confident that 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.890
 cambuur remains in good hands 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.080
 yes naturally we think i have that 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.720
 type her to dig and the three of me 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.090
 kind of the troika and we called it 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.820
 ourselves I think we are the we 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.190
 Cambuur always defend interests 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.320
 and type is still hard there is still 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.150
 but the emperor has come to that 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.320
 we have a good stuff with a good one 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.810
 selection 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.150
 my biggest concern for cambuur is 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.070
 is the stadium and for the rest I have 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.180
 I have the idea that it looks very good 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.220
 state 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.800
 yet I think it is different to run away 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.210
 at a football club such as cambuur then on 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.280
 proof of speech 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.870
 yes that's right but that's coming 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.440
 because we are here 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.750
 on 3 May 2013 with everyone whining for the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.880
 arms have flown and because we are with 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.920
 dwight lodeweges should have been here 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.990
 run for the supporters 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.060
 because we have moments in the city 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.230
 Sat because we have a loan from the 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.030
 needed because the club 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.660
 otherwise we would not have existed 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.760
 so 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.260
 with a group of people here also with 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.060
 a number of volunteers have such a bond 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.460
 built up by all that emotional 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.950
 moments that is just very different 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.820
 Then you go to Achmea or IV or or one 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.860
 another company 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.580
 the door closes behind you so that 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.580
 I take it that bad
