00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.040
 the university hospital hamburg-eppendorf belongs to the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.370
 most modern clinics in Europe more than 8000 employees are committed to 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.120
 human health research and teaching the specialists healing 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.119
 At first glance, this could be a cozy craft class 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.900
 in fact, the doctors of tomorrow are sitting here in Cairo 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.110
 Tobias Engelhardt is one of them in a course learning such rogue beautiful 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.439
 Art techniques and handling the material are what NADA is all about 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.980
 perpendicular to ticks half an inch from the fringe of the fringe 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.640
 and now stab in a wrist injury 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.510
 once through the tissue the coronation of the needle consequences that is whole 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.870
 important we have their reason the basic home market techniques 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.330
 so that we are basically able to at least know each other 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.690
 Learn how to easier even after performed and minor wounds 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.420
 Hong Kong can close 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.890
 and that, of course, with technology can take on internal leadership as 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.150
 actually not reachable 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.170
 housed the course is the forces in the medical 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.079
 Training center rhein-neckar e 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.159
 without any risk there trained on models his practical skills 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.299
 This also includes the revival in this doll let pulse rate and 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.299
 Ortmann simulate five points separate 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.490
 back then 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 Away from the patient 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.650
 Kate Baker's refuted copper price next evening is not about life and 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.160
 Death there waiting for the anatomical models to be borrowed 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.580
 a lot of sensitivity and a good dose of action like Jasper needs them 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.400
 minimally invasive procedure 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.300
 So an operation in the least possible skin is to be injured 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.730
 He learns to work in the room and with her on a piece of pork liver 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.960
 About it is just on the way to a lecture, the 25-year-old 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.549
 Medical student today has the lawyer on her timetable 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.749
 Even today, the lecture is an important part of the study 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.710
 for many inner improvement 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.280
 who have also made more training which one, for example, Reinecke 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.249
 fourth year of education is still something to find and then 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:20.379
 Mexican try and many internships then the accompanying open and 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.869
 where one had the whole thing at the graft right break another could 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.969
 that works in the lab with the delete 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.999
 Andreas Kruse belongs to a new generation of professors he wants 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.540
 Away from the gray theory around his lectures very close to the practice 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:35.750
 align 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.200
 three projectors should guarantee that up to 440 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.080
 Students also miss in the last row not a single molecule in the future 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.319
 the event should become even more interactive 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.029
 So the idea is there 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.969
 with her own laptop 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.689
 This can happen here 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.829
 For example, by giving feedback on specific questions 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 to order 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:02:59.939
 or maybe 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.169
 to that, whether the full even more interesting 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.289
 or has become a bit too monotonous 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:10.829
 The course of study should also be reformed starting in the winter semester of 2012 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.689
 So far, the students go through a theoretical one 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.689
 preclinical part that begins after two years at the clinical part of the 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.349
 Study that leads the students into the practice 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.319
 The aim of the reform is to bring theory and practice together earlier 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.739
 Nevertheless, medical studies is and remains a great one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:28.939
 Challenge 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.179
 Ballack just has to because my husband 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:35.539
 One day you just have no other moment in Greiz than you study 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:40.209
 But we are in the section began to have Steiner knees on there one is 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.059
 really from 8 o'clock in the morning to partly 18 o'clock at the university 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.329
 Municipal House that you keep learning 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.049
 And it is very exhausting but you realize the goal in mind 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.069
 Authenticity sometime 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.409
 but Kinect only really challenged Sander percent 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.239
 to be able to apply his knowledge 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.249
 Tobias Engelhardt was already in the second case of his studies to come with 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.429
 He is also able to treat patients professionally in conversations 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.299
 regularly with actors 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.790
 Work will thus confront diseases such as Alsheimer nobody 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 thereby also on speeds the question 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.099
 Fri cracking point 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.409
 that's fine so question what is this race doing 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.400
 For rank 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.389
 I still want to talk to him like that, too, as I have to talk about it 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.130
 Man goes on to say they have silvered friends 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.620
 how is it with us at their home carry out a well 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.960
 The actors work with detailed information during their hospital stay 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.710
 Scroll scripts which are unknown to the students in the protected frame 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.220
 Tobias can be on this path and know his communication Staal End 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.950
 use 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.090
 and also be evaluated immediately - it was the first Maat 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:55.349
 say professional speakers include you 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.449
 my soul should have reconciled - is 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.869
 SORBENT's lifestyle usually looks like it's finally here 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:04.629
 Patients acted 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.349
 They have a very cautious about a ladder to this delicate topic 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.469
 dementia diseases 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.779
 Tobias Damm teaches in the daily medical routine 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.399
 Patient bed proves patients stand up for an examination 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:18.229
 disposal 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.369
 later the procedure will be discussed by lecturers 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.899
 meanwhile everywhere serious during the first part of the study the hindere of the 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:26.849
 Know people 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.590
 In cooperation, body donors introduce themselves for educational purposes 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:35.259
 The dead will be treated with the same respect many treat 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.550
 patients 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.160
 what must be scary 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.529
 so it's my feast to fight my country 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.669
 Strunz 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.970
 and then you get a tad quicker than interest 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.080
 is sleeping and it is very much too 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.710
 Gratitude so that's that for what 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.390
 so most students did so instead of gratitude to them 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.819
 People are always easy 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.279
 because the lot for us ten years 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.359
 Timo Boll was and the other students in this course are building and the 

00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:08.519
 Vulnerability of the body know the teamwork and the confrontation with the 

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:11.719
 Death is an important experience for the future 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.889
 She then works on her new insights into the human body 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.159
 In the library you can buy 290 thousand books and magazines 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.970
 read there 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.020
 however, she often uses that internet portal for Ukraine students 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.120
 matching her timetable, she gets all the information about her event there 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.139
 Tobias Engelhardts is already close to his dream job 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.699
 later this year made the last exams 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.910
 Medicine is a team sport points 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.600
 Dante just has a lot to talk about with other people like us 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.969
 have done that 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.099
 and as I said always nice, so he always think in the short term 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.209
 set achievable goals and if the then achieved before still quite 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.279
 fine 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.929
 Tobias and bind want to understand the body of man and carry it 

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:56.100
 can 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.290
 Their path to medicine is long but enthusiasm for the profession gives them 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.600
 to stand the power
