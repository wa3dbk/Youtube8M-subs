pistols<00:01:05.060> rifles<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.510> thought<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.140> get

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
pistols rifles I thought that would get

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.039 
pistols rifles I thought that would get
it<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.510> hopefully<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.260> over<00:01:10.409> run

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
it and hopefully don't get on over run

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
it and hopefully don't get on over run
but<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.670> suck<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> get

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
but that would really suck to get

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.380 
but that would really suck to get
overrun<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.860> as<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
overrun but as you can see here in the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
overrun but as you can see here in the
gameplay<00:01:18.869> I'm<00:01:19.049> stopping<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.070> i

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
gameplay I'm stopping right here but i

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.249 
gameplay I'm stopping right here but i
do<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.450> killstreaks<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:22.080> think

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
do get you know my killstreaks i think

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
like twice on this but yeah so what I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
like twice on this but yeah so what I
would<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.380> actually<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.270> probably<00:01:30.270> um<00:01:31.790> not

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
would do actually do is probably um not

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
would do actually do is probably um not
my<00:01:32.909> house<00:01:33.119> cuz<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.570> kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
populated area not do populated I'd have

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.140 
populated area not do populated I'd have
to<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.170> place<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:38.220> find<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> players<00:01:38.909> get

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to like get place or find a players get

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.260 
to like get place or find a players get

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
in the car and just probably drive

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.899 
in the car and just probably drive
somewhere<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:44.280> populated

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
somewhere that is not that populated

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.520 
somewhere that is not that populated
like<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> house<00:01:45.470> like<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> country<00:01:47.189> where

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
like a house like in the country where

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.990 
like a house like in the country where
you<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.520> wouldn't<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.880> expect

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you would you wouldn't really expect

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
you would you wouldn't really expect
someone<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> would

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
someone to be there but you would

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.920 
someone to be there but you would
actually<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.759> an<00:01:53.939> advantage<00:01:54.420> over<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
actually have like an advantage over the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.160 
actually have like an advantage over the
zombies<00:01:55.549> then<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.750> guns<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
zombies then like with your guns and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.719 
zombies then like with your guns and
everything<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.649> probably<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.310> top<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
everything like probably on top of a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.050 
everything like probably on top of a
hill<00:01:59.909> too<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.710> easier<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.729> shoot

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
hill too because it's easier to shoot

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330 
hill too because it's easier to shoot
when<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:04.110> while<00:02:04.439> looking<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.979> down<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
when you're while looking like down the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.440 
when you're while looking like down the
hill<00:02:05.490> instead<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.090> walking<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.450> would

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
hill instead of walking up it so I would

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.600 
hill instead of walking up it so I would
do<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
do that and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.700 
do that and
I<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.750> don't<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.960> what<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.500> place

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
I don't I don't know what kind of place

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.030 
I don't I don't know what kind of place
it<00:02:13.920> would<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.700> um<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.890> is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it would be like this but um this is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.630 
it would be like this but um this is
this<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.250> my<00:02:17.400> imaginary<00:02:17.820> here<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.460> would

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.460 
that would look like would be able to
survive<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.299> my<00:04:15.420> family<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.019> all<00:04:16.109> those

survive it and my family and all those
people<00:04:16.950> they<00:04:17.880> would<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.060> able<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.239> survive<00:04:18.479> it

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
people they would be able to survive it

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.400 
people they would be able to survive it
but<00:04:20.359> depends<00:04:21.359> how<00:04:21.510> many<00:04:21.570> either<00:04:21.900> actually<00:04:22.260> are

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
but depends how many either actually are
