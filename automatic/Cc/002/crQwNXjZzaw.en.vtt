in<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.550> play<00:01:42.729> mode<00:01:42.940> you<00:01:43.149> have<00:01:43.179> I'm<00:01:43.720> going<00:01:43.960> to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
in the play mode you have I'm going to

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.710 
in the play mode you have I'm going to
say<00:01:44.140> no<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:45.130> play<00:01:45.310> mode<00:01:45.429> you<00:01:45.550> gotta

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
say no and the play mode you gotta

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.960 
say no and the play mode you gotta
crapola<00:01:46.720> in<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.049> play<00:01:47.259> mode<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.790> have<00:01:48.909> a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
crapola in the play mode you have a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.609 
crapola in the play mode you have a
couple<00:01:49.150> different<00:01:49.329> types<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.110> games<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.439> can

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
couple different types of games you can

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.340 
couple different types of games you can
play<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:50.860> got<00:01:51.040> classic<00:01:51.579> bad<00:01:52.000> lens<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:53.020> speed

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
play you got classic bad lens and speed

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.130 
play you got classic bad lens and speed
stack<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.920> so<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.640> classic<00:01:55.180> it's<00:01:55.420> really

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
stack and so in classic it's really

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.899 
stack and so in classic it's really
really<00:01:56.409> simple<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:57.250> have<00:01:57.399> an<00:01:57.549> amount<00:01:57.729> of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
really simple you have an amount of

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.539 
really simple you have an amount of
hearts<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:59.290> have<00:01:59.500> you<00:02:00.220> don't<00:02:00.399> have<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
hearts and you have you don't have a

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.429 
hearts and you have you don't have a
time<00:02:00.790> limit<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.149> you<00:02:01.360> can<00:02:01.780> keep<00:02:01.930> on<00:02:02.110> stacking

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
time limit so you can keep on stacking

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.319 
time limit so you can keep on stacking
until<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.009> run<00:02:03.130> out<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.340> hearts<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:04.060> lose<00:02:04.299> a

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
until you run out of hearts you lose a

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.810 
until you run out of hearts you lose a
heart<00:02:04.720> by<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.799> know<00:02:05.920> I'm<00:02:06.130> miss<00:02:06.340> stacking<00:02:06.759> a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
heart by you know I'm miss stacking a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.940 
heart by you know I'm miss stacking a
sheep<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.240> letting<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.689> couple<00:02:08.229> fall<00:02:08.410> that's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
sheep and letting a couple fall that's

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.460 
sheep and letting a couple fall that's
how<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.160> lose<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.369> heart<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.200> have<00:02:11.230> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
how you lose a heart and you all have to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.020 
how you lose a heart and you all have to
do<00:02:11.590> with<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.829> classic<00:02:12.370> mode<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:12.880> just

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
do with this classic mode is you just

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.340 
do with this classic mode is you just
got<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.239> keep<00:02:13.329> on<00:02:13.480> stacking<00:02:13.720> until<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.260> run

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
got to keep on stacking until you run

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.620 
got to keep on stacking until you run
out<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.560> how<00:02:14.680> hearts<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.459> my<00:02:15.700> highest<00:02:16.360> i<00:02:16.420> think

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
out of how hearts and my highest i think

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.580 
out of how hearts and my highest i think
is<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:16.870> 50<00:02:17.320> something<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:18.610> not<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.940> great

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
is like 50 something it's not that great

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.009 
is like 50 something it's not that great
imbalance<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.430> use<00:02:24.459> your

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
imbalance you have to use your

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.390 
imbalance you have to use your
accelerometer<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.260> actually<00:02:26.709> stack<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
accelerometer to actually stack the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.340 
accelerometer to actually stack the
sheep<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.820> that's<00:02:28.390> pretty<00:02:28.600> much<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
sheep and that's pretty much it it's the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.720 
sheep and that's pretty much it it's the
same<00:02:29.530> thing<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.739> classic<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.549> have<00:02:30.640> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
same thing as classic just you have to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.819 
same thing as classic just you have to
use<00:02:31.180> your<00:02:31.209> accelerometers<00:02:31.959> yeah<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.680> found

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
use your accelerometers yeah and I found

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.470 
use your accelerometers yeah and I found
that<00:02:32.980> with<00:02:33.100> my<00:02:33.190> camcorder<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:34.360> gonna

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that with my camcorder that I'm gonna

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.690 
that with my camcorder that I'm gonna
have<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:34.989> cut<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.590> up<00:02:35.739> I'm<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.489> have<00:02:36.610> to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
have to like cut it up I'm gonna have to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.830 
have to like cut it up I'm gonna have to
make<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> screen<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> little<00:02:37.180> smaller<00:02:37.630> because

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
make the screen a little smaller because

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.479 
make the screen a little smaller because
it<00:02:38.049> does<00:02:38.200> cut<00:02:38.410> off<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> video<00:02:38.799> like<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.220> much

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
it does cut off the video like this much

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.050 
it does cut off the video like this much
so<00:02:40.090> yeah<00:02:40.570> I'm<00:02:40.870> hopefully<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.530> will<00:02:41.620> work<00:02:42.060> as

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
so yeah I'm hopefully this will work as

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.250 
so yeah I'm hopefully this will work as
you<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.329> see<00:02:43.510> I'm<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> little<00:02:43.900> farther<00:02:44.109> away

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
you can see I'm a little farther away

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.259 
you can see I'm a little farther away
from<00:02:44.350> my<00:02:44.590> ipod<00:02:44.890> as<00:02:45.070> usual<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.609> then<00:02:45.970> speed

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
from my ipod as usual and then speed

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.819 
from my ipod as usual and then speed
stack<00:02:46.540> you're<00:02:46.690> giving<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.989> set<00:02:47.200> time<00:02:47.380> limit<00:02:47.739> and

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
stack you're giving a set time limit and

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.020 
stack you're giving a set time limit and
no<00:02:47.980> hearts<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.430> you're<00:02:48.549> just<00:02:48.760> trying<00:02:48.940> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
no hearts and you're just trying to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.089 
no hearts and you're just trying to
stack<00:02:49.329> as<00:02:49.600> many<00:02:49.630> as<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.110> possibly<00:02:50.410> can<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.800> a

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
stack as many as you possibly can in a

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.830 
stack as many as you possibly can in a
set<00:02:51.310> period<00:02:51.489> of<00:02:51.640> time<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:52.030> wish<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.540> thought<00:02:52.720> you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
set period of time I wish I thought you

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.760 
set period of time I wish I thought you
you<00:02:53.110> know<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.530> know

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770

like that um let's just go into classic

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.280 
like that um let's just go into classic
because<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.390> fundamentals<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.020> game<00:03:08.080> are

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
because the fundamentals of the game are

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.650 
because the fundamentals of the game are
