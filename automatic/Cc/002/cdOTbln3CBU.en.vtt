00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
xbox 360 and ps3 which isn't too hard to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
xbox 360 and ps3 which isn't too hard to
believe<00:00:54.690> at<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.440> ps3<00:00:55.860> uses<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
believe at all because the ps3 uses a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.090 
believe at all because the ps3 uses a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
ps3 xbox 360 is really outdated now I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
ps3 xbox 360 is really outdated now I
mean<00:01:07.110> they're<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.710> pathetically

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
mean they're really pathetically

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.060 
mean they're really pathetically
underpowered<00:01:08.960> looking<00:01:09.960> pair<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> modern<00:01:10.590> pcs

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
underpowered looking pair to modern pcs

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
underpowered looking pair to modern pcs
so<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:12.600> don't<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:12.900> we'll<00:01:13.110> take

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so I really don't think we'll take

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.630 
so I really don't think we'll take
months<00:01:13.530> become<00:01:13.860> more<00:01:14.040> powerful<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.400> those<00:01:14.520> two

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
months become more powerful in those two

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.969 
months become more powerful in those two

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
now imagine a gaming controller like the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.370 
now imagine a gaming controller like the
360s<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:56.759> example<00:01:57.149> what<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.750> 6<00:01:58.140> inch

360s for example what they 6 inch
touchscreen<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.280> that<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.020> kind

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
touchscreen on it that is you know kind

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.620 
touchscreen on it that is you know kind
of<00:02:01.439> crazy<00:02:01.649> thing<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.420> sure<00:02:03.479> if

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of crazy thing about so I'm not sure if

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.170 
of crazy thing about so I'm not sure if
I<00:02:03.780> totally<00:02:04.110> believe<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:05.579> six<00:02:05.790> inches<00:02:06.030> right

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
I totally believe the six inches right

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180 
I totally believe the six inches right
there<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.350> believe<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.860> will<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there but I do believe it will have a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.529 
there but I do believe it will have a
touchscreen<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.970> some<00:02:09.119> sort<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
touchscreen of some sort on the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.510 
touchscreen of some sort on the
controller<00:02:10.080> itself<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:10.860> Nintendo<00:02:11.370> has

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
controller itself because Nintendo has

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.460 
controller itself because Nintendo has
stated<00:02:11.760> publicly<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.270> their<00:02:13.140> biggest

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
stated publicly that their biggest

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.910 
stated publicly that their biggest
contender

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
contender

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.610 
contender
is<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.120> near<00:02:15.300> microsoft<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:16.230> actually

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
is not so near microsoft it's actually

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.680 
is not so near microsoft it's actually
the<00:02:16.740> mobile<00:02:17.069> gaming<00:02:17.250> market<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.819> iOS<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the mobile gaming market in iOS and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.870 
the mobile gaming market in iOS and
Android<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:20.069> what<00:02:20.250> I'm<00:02:20.340> thinking<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.819> that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
Android so now what I'm thinking is that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.580 
Android so now what I'm thinking is that
Nintendo<00:02:21.420> wants<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.900> steal<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> Thunder<00:02:22.500> way

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
Nintendo wants to steal the Thunder way

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.190 
Nintendo wants to steal the Thunder way
from<00:02:22.770> ios<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.310> android<00:02:23.430> by<00:02:24.330> creating<00:02:24.959> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
from ios and android by creating a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.160 
from ios and android by creating a
gaming<00:02:26.069> console<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:27.060> also<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.360> sub<00:02:27.780> console

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
gaming console but also I sub console

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.750 
gaming console but also I sub console
within<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.470> console<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.310> play<00:02:29.550> those

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
within that console so it can play those

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.910 
within that console so it can play those
mobile<00:02:29.940> kind<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.300> games<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.620> download

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
mobile kind of games and it can download

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.979 
mobile kind of games and it can download
those<00:02:32.040> games<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.489> other<00:02:32.610> new<00:02:33.000> online<00:02:33.239> system

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
those games the other new online system

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.540 
those games the other new online system
so<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.200> could<00:02:34.470> be<00:02:34.500> very<00:02:35.040> popular<00:02:35.370> right

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so that could be very popular right

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.040 
so that could be very popular right
there<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.450> believe<00:02:36.750> they're<00:02:36.870> going<00:02:36.989> to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
there and I do believe they're going to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.559 
there and I do believe they're going to
do<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.380> because<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.370> said<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:39.420> have

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
do that because like I said they have

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.940 
do that because like I said they have
publicly<00:02:39.870> stated<00:02:40.260> many<00:02:40.410> times<00:02:40.560> at<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
publicly stated many times at the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.040 
publicly stated many times at the
biggest<00:02:41.250> competitor<00:02:41.670> right<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.239> ios<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
biggest competitor right now is ios and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.110 
biggest competitor right now is ios and
android<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.560> Sony<00:02:43.769> Microsoft<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.760> do

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
android not Sony Microsoft so I do

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.180 
android not Sony Microsoft so I do
believe<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.930> touch<00:02:46.200> screen<00:02:46.230> will<00:02:47.040> be

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
believe that this touch screen will be

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.240 
believe that this touch screen will be
used<00:02:47.489> me<00:02:48.269> know<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.569> not<00:02:48.750> fully<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.410> part<00:02:49.709> to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
used me know it not fully but in part to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.430 
used me know it not fully but in part to
play<00:02:50.459> mobile<00:02:50.940> games<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.720> another

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
play mobile games on it and another

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.440 
play mobile games on it and another
critical<00:02:52.980> feature<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:53.700> controller<00:02:54.209> is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
critical feature of this controller is

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.809 
critical feature of this controller is
that<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:55.140> can<00:02:55.290> stream<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.769> games<00:02:56.220> wirelessly

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819

6 inch touchscreen on the controller

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.509 
6 inch touchscreen on the controller
itself<00:03:02.700> which<00:03:03.510> would<00:03:03.959> be<00:03:04.080> pretty<00:03:04.410> cool<00:03:04.519> but
