flipping another really important thing

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.990 
flipping another really important thing
is<00:00:42.540> knowing<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.170> rotations<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.850> want

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
is knowing your rotations you don't want

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.729 
is knowing your rotations you don't want
to<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.239> take<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> bottle<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> throw<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to just take a bottle and throw it in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.029

the air

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.709 
the air
because<00:00:47.610> you're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.180> hard<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> know

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because you're going to be hard to know

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
because you're going to be hard to know
when<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> grab<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> concept<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
when to grab it so the concept is is to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
when to grab it so the concept is is to
know<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.270> rotation<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> how<00:00:52.590> hard<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> throw

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
know your rotation of how hard to throw

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
know your rotation of how hard to throw
it<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.730> rotation<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:55.170> rotations

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it for one rotation and two rotations

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
it for one rotation and two rotations
and<00:00:55.980> things<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:57.059> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> know

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and things like that you need to know

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
and things like that you need to know
your<00:00:57.600> height<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.260> need<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:58.770> hard<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
your height you need to know how hard to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
your height you need to know how hard to
snap<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.640> wrist<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> create<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> feel<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
snap your wrist and create a feel of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080 
snap your wrist and create a feel of
muscle<00:01:01.710> memory<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.820> where

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
muscle memory so that you know where

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.939 
muscle memory so that you know where
your<00:01:03.210> bottle<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> land<00:01:04.110> before<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
your bottle is going to land before it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.310 
your bottle is going to land before it
does<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.299> exact<00:01:06.659> idea<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
does you want to have an exact idea of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.380 
does you want to have an exact idea of
where<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> place<00:01:08.280> your<00:01:08.549> hand<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
where to place your hand and when the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
where to place your hand and when the
bottle<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> fall<00:01:10.170> into<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.890> then

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
bottle is going to fall into it and then

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.280 
bottle is going to fall into it and then
the<00:01:11.790> third<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.330> which<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> probably<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the third thing which is probably the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
the third thing which is probably the
hardest<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.860> new<00:01:14.010> Flair<00:01:14.280> bartenders<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
hardest for new Flair bartenders is to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.300 
hardest for new Flair bartenders is to
walk<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> bar<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> try<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> behind

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
walk into a bar and try to do it behind

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
walk into a bar and try to do it behind
the<00:01:17.549> bar<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.270> there's<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> progression<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the bar so there's a progression of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.960 
the bar so there's a progression of
practice<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.159> start<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.610> your<00:01:20.729> flare

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
practice you start with your flare

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.550 
practice you start with your flare
bottle<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.080> shatterproof

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bottle which is which is shatterproof

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.679 
bottle which is which is shatterproof
and<00:01:22.860> unbreakable<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.759> gain<00:01:23.939> confidence<00:01:24.270> in

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and unbreakable to gain confidence in

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.450 
and unbreakable to gain confidence in
your<00:01:24.990> move<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> muscle<00:01:26.009> memory<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
your move and get the muscle memory and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
your move and get the muscle memory and
get<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> feel<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
get the feel for it then you take a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
get the feel for it then you take a
empty<00:01:29.159> glass<00:01:29.400> bottle<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:29.970> start<00:01:30.240> practicing

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
empty glass bottle and start practicing
