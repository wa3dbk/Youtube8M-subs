00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hey sports club i am simon newer 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.120
 muscle makers in this video pro and 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.670
 contra to the so-called fat grips too 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.490
 this funny rubber thing here 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 philips ticker at the same weight 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.610
 that's the slogan do not dazzle that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 Let's just say that you see that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 in fact, the advertising message so one 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.140
 thicker grip he should lead to that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.050
 the muscles become more so more 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.550
 Muscles here is the advertising message with 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.510
 I always talk about advertising 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.980
 Carefully around 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.269
 I want you in this video also 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.769
 do not be bored but I will be you 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.460
 Immediately show how I do with these things 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.960
 work out 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.030
 first and foremost 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 Imagination of them are quite robust 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.809
 I would appreciate that the apiece 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 So for about 200 grams weigh relatively 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.120
 heavy 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 they have me one side so one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.410
 opening and although here you can the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 get dumbbell and go 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 automatically back to, however, is 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.350
 then a small gap and something like that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.940
 They look like that but they hold 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.860
 really good at the dumbbells and have 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.809
 also grip so this rubber this 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.399
 Rubber ensures that the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.750
 also do not turn the dumbbell bar and 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.340
 turn but at the moment where you too 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.350
 still to pack it is a good one 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 Connection from the processing ago mose 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.790
 First of all, say it is quite good, but also 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.260
 as expected good for the price 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.869
 I also expect a good one 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.680
 workmanship and a good quality 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.850
 I do myself a lot 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.229
 I can not be difficult at first 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.420
 Imagine how to get it done 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.860
 his grip pieces so materials 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 this robustness but also 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.400
 flexibility to get so who's there 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.170
 an idea has how somehow 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.909
 could do it without you 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.380
 because the training in danger can bring 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.180
 he likes to be below this video 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.159
 otherwise I comment on this 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.020
 first no alternative that are here 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.670
 the original fed grips are now available 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.229
 There are also a few other companies that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.280
 whole try in the similar way and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.990
 to recreate 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.369
 as I said with the original one is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.930
 certainly always very good and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.490
 That's why I would suggest 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.659
 We'll take a look at how 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.340
 I'm training at the coup 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.340
 Dumbbells have used press 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.570
 intervened quite easy to see 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.300
 relatively big is a strange feeling 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.740
 when dumbbells press such a big 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.270
 So, just have them 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.370
 things then here a bit far 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.650
 come up with my little back around 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.570
 it is really a funny feeling to take hold of 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.700
 he also has a little bit of that 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.130
 So power is lacking this full control 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.200
 and full power I had to be around eight 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.880
 to ten kilos less use have 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.110
 but had a good feeling too 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.120
 especially in the field of poor 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.620
 strangely, on the triceps law 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.360
 strong pump has developed 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.310
 possibly to do with that my 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.630
 Forearm is simply burdened differently and 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.100
 I'm fine with the triceps 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.630
 pushed out the breast, however, too 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.459
 already felt with the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.800
 Breast to he with the attitude on the bank 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.360
 to do so I have to say at the coup 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.070
 They do not completely train me 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.239
 I had to weigh less 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.310
 Of course, it is for one's own ego 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.840
 always said, however, for themselves 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.910
 I have to say the training was so far 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.260
 good at pol exercises I have them the other day 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.239
 I also use it very much 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.250
 hard to do with the example of 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.019
 cross my arms with my little hands 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.610
 to pull more than 70 kilos because I'm there 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.480
 just barely get around if I times 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.430
 I'm curious soon 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.380
 Try how I like with these things 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.330
 can cross lift do now we come 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.000
 to what they are actually made for 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.920
 namely for the biceps training for the arm 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.239
 I have training in and of itself 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.500
 made together with sarah and 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.660
 maybe we look at that too 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.880
 at times such as when training there with us a 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.680
 bicep curls with the sz rod passed 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.330
 is sarah has he trained i have 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.080
 So let's have a look at it 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.080
 even just now 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.480
 for biceps training are the things 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.070
 Of course I had to do that 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.260
 first of all, take less weight 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.780
 although otherwise I left with 20 kilos and 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.030
 right with 80 just times my normal 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.620
 I've started training weight 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.660
 I then 15 kilo left and right 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.430
 taken has absolutely given me in 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.290
 club I just noticed how I 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.610
 the dinger did not rob the power 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.160
 but like me these things actually 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.720
 a very intense feeling during training 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.500
 it is not obvious 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.050
 to assign 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.850
 This handle makes you different 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.280
 may train more intensively 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.990
 trains because you just less 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.190
 You can move weight 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.710
 not by hand normally 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.480
 I like to train with 25 kilos 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.040
 left and right in this case were 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.110
 15 kilos on each side 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.790
 that was an incredibly good point too 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.140
 right here so in the biceps tip 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.070
 I noticed it was a great feeling 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.870
 during training 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.060
 I will definitely continue if 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.830
 actually bring more muscle 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.270
 You can only do so after some time 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.400
 a promotional pledge or treat 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.440
 I always look at that very critically 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.660
 feeling in training is a good one though 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.040
 preferably just with exercises 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.940
 I'll recommend her otherwise 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.860
 probably not further 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.720
 but use for all exercises 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.090
 i will definitely use it again 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.620
 that is my conclusion to the fed grips the 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.090
 you can find her muskelmann shop 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.680
 look at yourself if you like it 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.270
 I wanted to train 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.220
 one manages only once and the 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.320
 so stay with the 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.240
 quality you can expect that too 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.040
 All right, so much of me in this 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.570
 video see you in the next lot 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.570
 greetings from your simon
