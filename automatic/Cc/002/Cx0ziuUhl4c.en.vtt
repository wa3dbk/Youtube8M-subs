users don't have to come to them they

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.619 
users don't have to come to them they
come<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.469> the<00:03:05.590> user<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
come to the user and it's the

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.929 
come to the user and it's the
combination<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.530> these<00:03:08.650> two<00:03:08.709> things<00:03:09.099> that<00:03:09.909> I

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
combination of these two things that I

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.110 
combination of these two things that I
think<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.449> let<00:03:11.260> us<00:03:11.290> make<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.730> kind<00:03:13.000> of

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
think is let us make the kind of

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.839 
think is let us make the kind of
creative<00:03:13.569> products<00:03:13.989> like<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.709> iPad<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:17.849> we've
