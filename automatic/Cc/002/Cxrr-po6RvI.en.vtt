00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
head over Hmong impact on the snapshot

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.390 
head over Hmong impact on the snapshot
video<00:00:06.990> we<00:00:07.440> are<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.799> 13<00:00:08.700> 6a<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.860> elevators

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
video we are on 13 6a and the elevators

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.419 
video we are on 13 6a and the elevators
have<00:00:11.550> changed<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.240> items<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.099> one<00:00:14.309> that

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
have changed for items so this one that

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.640 
have changed for items so this one that
was<00:00:14.519> working<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.120> all<00:00:15.509> amounts<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.990> items<00:00:16.289> now

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
was working for all amounts of items now

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.330 
was working for all amounts of items now
only<00:00:16.949> works<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.490> wanted<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:19.189> any<00:00:20.189> more

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
only works for wanted to go any more

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.630 
only works for wanted to go any more
than<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.029> will<00:00:21.090> stall<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.310> that's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
than that and it will stall so that's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.830 
than that and it will stall so that's
unfortunate<00:00:24.949> but<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:27.000> item<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.599> still

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
unfortunate but for one item it's still

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.160 
unfortunate but for one item it's still
nice<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.050> compact<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.189> works<00:00:29.640> very<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:30.170> but

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
nice and compact and works very well but

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.269 
nice and compact and works very well but
I've<00:00:31.260> come<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> new<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I've come for the new one for the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.130 
I've come for the new one for the
snapshot<00:00:32.730> now<00:00:33.059> they've<00:00:33.239> changed<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
snapshot now they've changed how the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.500 
snapshot now they've changed how the
comparators<00:00:34.710> work<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:35.850> need<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> reset

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
comparators work you now need to reset

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.280 
comparators work you now need to reset
it<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.410> put<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> stack<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> items<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.290> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
it so put a stack of items in there so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.479 
it so put a stack of items in there so
the<00:00:40.379> items<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> Gantt

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the items are going out and the Gantt

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.569 
the items are going out and the Gantt
quite<00:00:41.700> fast<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:43.800> half<00:00:43.980> mark<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
quite fast and this half mark with it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.060 
quite fast and this half mark with it
you<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.690> comparator<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.890> into<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you got the comparator going into a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.930 
you got the comparator going into a
block<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:49.520> re-energizing<00:00:50.520> ethic

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
block it's then re-energizing ethic

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.459 
block it's then re-energizing ethic
comparator<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.809> giving<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> new<00:00:52.320> update

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
comparator just giving it a new update

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.979 
comparator just giving it a new update
and<00:00:52.920> then<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.850> same<00:00:54.090> principle<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.600> before

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and then the same principle as before

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.439 
and then the same principle as before
but<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.559> store<00:00:55.829> Peter<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> block

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
but which store Peter going to the block

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.959 
but which store Peter going to the block
so<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.379> how<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.680> working<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so that's how it's working now it's a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.270 
so that's how it's working now it's a
bit<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.359> lumpy<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.989> over<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.129> I've<00:01:02.219> got

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
bit more lumpy and over here I've got

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
bit more lumpy and over here I've got
two<00:01:02.489> different<00:01:02.640> configurations<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
two different configurations of it this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.840 
two different configurations of it this
is<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> stating<00:01:05.820> opposite<00:01:06.270> sided<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.850> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
is a stating opposite sided one that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.429 
is a stating opposite sided one that
shows<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.600> putting<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.020> stack<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
shows by think putting a stack of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.880 
shows by think putting a stack of
something<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:11.210> couple<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> stacks

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
something there couple of stacks

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
something there couple of stacks
whatever<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.369> show<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.030> works<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
whatever you want just show it works of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
whatever you want just show it works of
everything<00:01:15.979> it's<00:01:16.979> got<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> spend<00:01:17.400> swap<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
everything it's got to spend swap the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.810 
everything it's got to spend swap the
top<00:01:17.790> there<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.619> works<00:01:20.009> that's<00:01:20.610> good

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
top there so now that works that's good

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.660 
top there so now that works that's good
I<00:01:21.320> might<00:01:22.320> try<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.619> look<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:22.830> compacting<00:01:23.400> even

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
I might try and look at compacting even

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.749 
I might try and look at compacting even
more<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.420> version<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
more so this version here is just a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.480 
more so this version here is just a
reflected<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> only<00:01:28.890> thing<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
reflected one the only thing is just the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.560 
reflected one the only thing is just the
amount<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.759> red<00:01:29.850> stone<00:01:30.060> yet<00:01:30.180> without<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
amount of red stone yet without the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.510 
amount of red stone yet without the
sides<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.290> harder<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> put<00:01:31.979> things<00:01:32.189> into

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
sides so it's harder to put things into

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.600 
sides so it's harder to put things into
it<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.000> hoppers<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.430> one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it with hoppers as you see this one

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.690 
it with hoppers as you see this one
works<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.030> well<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.159> through<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:38.610> quickly

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
works as well so go through very quickly

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
works as well so go through very quickly
again<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.540> how<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> build<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.110> well<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
again just how you build this well just

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
again just how you build this well just
grab<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.159> dropper<00:01:43.460> now<00:01:44.460> when<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> drops<00:01:44.909> are

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
grab a dropper now when the drops are

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
grab a dropper now when the drops are
firing<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.600> each<00:01:45.689> other<00:01:45.840> they<00:01:46.140> are<00:01:46.259> silent

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
firing into each other they are silent

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.359 
firing into each other they are silent
so<00:01:47.369> comparator<00:01:47.939> their<00:01:48.240> block<00:01:48.990> their<00:01:49.380> names

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so comparator their block their names

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
so comparator their block their names
need<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.759> repeater<00:01:51.180> coming<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.659> because

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
need a repeater coming up this because

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.190 
need a repeater coming up this because
the<00:01:52.500> signal<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.890> only<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.520> block<00:01:53.970> long<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the signal is only one block long so you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.530 
the signal is only one block long so you
have<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> grab<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> from<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:57.299> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
have to grab it from that and then you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.859 
have to grab it from that and then you
just<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.840> again<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.740> put<00:01:59.009> repeater<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.869> so

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
just go again and put repeater there so

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.420 
just go again and put repeater there so
I'm<00:02:01.020> we're<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.500> look<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.740> compacting

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I'm we're going to look at compacting

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
I'm we're going to look at compacting
this<00:02:02.579> some<00:02:02.790> wall<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.180> seeing<00:02:03.780> if<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.079> meld

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
this some wall and seeing if I can meld

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
this some wall and seeing if I can meld
two<00:02:05.070> layers<00:02:05.280> together<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.149> make<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> more

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
two layers together to make a more

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.520 
two layers together to make a more
efficient<00:02:07.140> way<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.380> doing<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.819> moment

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
efficient way of doing it but moment
