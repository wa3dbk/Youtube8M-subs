breakfast at tomorrowland terrace where
I<00:01:49.790> have<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.060> French<00:01:50.330> toast<00:01:50.830> much<00:01:51.830> before<00:01:52.160> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
I have the French toast much before the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.520 
I have the French toast much before the
french<00:01:52.400> toast<00:01:52.870> but<00:01:53.870> you<00:01:54.050> know<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.200> think<00:01:54.470> I've

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
french toast but you know I think I've

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.960 
french toast but you know I think I've
been<00:01:54.620> throwing<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.100> little<00:01:55.370> bit<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.550> syrup<00:01:55.760> and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
been throwing a little bit of syrup and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.250 
been throwing a little bit of syrup and
I<00:01:56.060> mean<00:01:56.180> we'll<00:01:56.330> have<00:01:56.540> a<00:01:56.570> go<00:01:56.780> with<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.990> CR<00:01:57.200> up

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
I mean we'll have a go with the CR up

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.630 
I mean we'll have a go with the CR up
and<00:01:57.380> see<00:01:57.470> if<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.620> helps<00:01:58.130> out<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.370> little<00:01:58.550> bit<00:01:58.730> I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
and see if that helps out a little bit I

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.470 
and see if that helps out a little bit I
think<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:01.730> kind<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.940> hard<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.120> screw<00:02:02.330> up<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
think it's kind of hard to screw up a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.660 
think it's kind of hard to screw up a
pancake<00:02:02.870> these<00:02:03.500> are<00:02:03.650> moist<00:02:03.890> they're<00:02:04.250> not<00:02:04.400> dry
