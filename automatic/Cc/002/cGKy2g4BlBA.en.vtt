use use the plane for me my main aim
this<00:00:53.670> year<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.059> obviously<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> fight<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
this year was obviously to fight for the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.420 
this year was obviously to fight for the
World<00:00:55.199> Championship<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.190> fairly

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
World Championship and to do it fairly

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.939 
and I think that is so important in this
sport<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.520> I<00:01:03.170> think<00:01:04.170> people<00:01:04.379> realize<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
