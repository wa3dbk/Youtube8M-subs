the radio so what I want to go ahead and
try<00:03:01.780> out<00:03:02.080> today<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:05.290> scramble<00:03:06.010> feature<00:03:06.959> so

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
try out today is the scramble feature so

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.290

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.009 
that's 150 1.8 2-0 megahertz and still
leave<00:04:04.870> everything<00:04:05.110> else<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.560> way<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.370> and

leave everything else the way it is and
I'm<00:04:08.019> going<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.260> write<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.609> radio<00:04:09.940> so

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
I'm going to write that to the radio so

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.850 
I'm going to write that to the radio so
program<00:04:11.160> write<00:04:12.160> data<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.700> enter<00:04:12.880> phone

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
program write data to enter phone

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.360 
program write data to enter phone
hit<00:04:14.860> okay<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:16.500> I'm<00:04:17.500> going<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.680> do<00:04:17.800> part<00:04:17.830> two<00:04:18.340> of

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
hit okay and I'm going to do part two of

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.590 
hit okay and I'm going to do part two of
this<00:04:18.700> video<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.570> these<00:04:19.810> Grambling<00:04:20.200> function
