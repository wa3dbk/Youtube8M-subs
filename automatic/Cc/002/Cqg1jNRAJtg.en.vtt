 jan boerma we are with you in the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
 kitchen restaurant the last and you 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.849
 Kirk's finally known because of you 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.349
 ingenuity and your acids 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.460
 fresh acids 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.439
 what else can you tell about it 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.199
 your kitchen i love acids 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.359
 globally, that is also often the balance 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.279
 in your mouth when I create a dish 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.529
 I first think my tongue from my tongue 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.090
 is actually the basis for the balance 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.489
 then need a piece of fat and sit 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 Must be sour bitter bitter at all 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 dishes that we prepare is a form 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.129
 of acid and that can be done through 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.890
 be an apple that can be done through 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.049
 citrus are natural or exotic 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.100
 taste and otherwise love very much 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.420
 vegetables 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.970
 he i love vegetables we have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.010
 very large private garden at least one guest 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.199
 of us managed that all who do 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 it all and that is kind of addicted 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.369
 hit city biologist and thus get it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.390
 We actually land every morning 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.390
 fresh vegetables 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.460
 and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.740
 once said an interview of 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.969
 well in order to survive must not 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.320
 just stay behind the cancer 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.399
 but you have to do more than alone 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.750
 Which 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.909
 what exactly do you do for the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.679
 experience for the guests to complete 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.780
 to make 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.399
 well look that's more of a story 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.840
 become from a long time ago when I just got 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.039
 states people also went out 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.630
 eat to eat 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.310
 nowadays people go out to eat for one 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.860
 Just like that you go to the theater 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.270
 is really for experience 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.670
 so that package is a bit bigger 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.740
 more small details have got me 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.380
 not only do i do everyone we are 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.630
 making a very full-length story 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.209
 the theatrical is always in the restaurant 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.640
 more normal but on the other hand there is also 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.240
 another trend on the corridor 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.069
 about 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.069
 is where you come from scandinavia delicious 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:06.069
 a two dishes loosely at the table 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.019
 so eat the 6 there and that is very much 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.429
 movement in the culinary world 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.970
 What do you think of this development which 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.370
 cooking school want to cook again 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.769
 h &amp; l misunderstandings we have to delete 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.500
 cooking for years very nice only 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.239
 crisis requires different creativity 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.980
 we must increasingly respond to the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.579
 market but I actually want to keep what 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 I do 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.819
 and why I'm so many things there 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.400
 outside to do I do that in the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.799
 medicine world I do what I do 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.380
 have to be in there with hospitals busy 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.040
 nutrition to think along very 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.900
 many lectures 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.060
 I recently had a very simple one 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.980
 cookbook made with sacha de boer 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.019
 to show that yes that is still there 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.970
 becoming a market but not so much one 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.549
 more specifically on the very exclusive 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.049
 but a bit all round and what is 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.660
 your future music what are you doing 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.970
 We can follow yours after each one 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.160
 stay the case and embroider on what we 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.310
 and try to grow very steadily 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.790
 because that is of course also in this time 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.099
 very important and 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.560
 I think I'm on a different plane 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.780
 focus more on the future 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.909
 because I am yes when I am 50 55 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.850
 I do not expect that I am still on top 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.400
 this purpose 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.050
 proof of it 24 hours a day 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.520
 but then there comes quite a bit of fun 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.580
 to the future 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.810
 and that is the basis for that 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.220
 we keep an eye on 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.220
 yes thank you thank you 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 a
