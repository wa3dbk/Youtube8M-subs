00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 elia left today on the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 wish one of my best friend 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.389
 something else glitter nail design for 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.280
 you and that is special about it 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.410
 that the glittering does not run from the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.570
 tip to the rest of the nail goes but 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.800
 the other way around I hope that pleases 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 I catch you then much fun you 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.230
 needs to have a suitable for it 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.849
 Paint varnish and varnish glitter 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.040
 of course and this time a brush first 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 Once you finish with the subject and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.440
 drive your nails and leave the whole 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.629
 dry thoroughly then you take 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.110
 you the overcoat or a clear coat if 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.390
 you have and just give it up that way 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.239
 lower i would lower the two 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:59.850
 say third of the nail then you take 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.680
 you the glitter and there you jump with 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.049
 The brush now a bit pure and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.030
 it takes glitter on the way that is 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.760
 a tip from a dear spectator 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 and really good because if you do that now 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.110
 Apply on the nail then you can 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.330
 you can see that as well 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 problem does not have that glitter too 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.990
 there is a lot of things to do, but one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.990
 can really layer that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.610
 to apply more then you take too 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:39.040
 just another layer of the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.060
 clear lacquer and then goes in there too 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.560
 little glitter over it makes you 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.080
 now so long until you run 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.060
 I really like that, by the way 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.860
 in this combination with the bright 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.979
 paint or with gray or at all 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.630
 to even shades because so 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.340
 looks a little more noble and I think 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.110
 that fits perfectly for Valentine's Day 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.490
 after he nails it now 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.300
 has done and the whole well 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.280
 let it dry you sealed that 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.800
 whole again with a nice layer 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.130
 Over lay with the glitter have good 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.410
 Sealed is not just falling off and 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.410
 just the feeling when wearing 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.569
 more comfortable and that's how it looks 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.330
 In the end I think that fits 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.760
 We are also perfect for these churches 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.010
 were despite the sad origin 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.380
 are still sticking trends and me 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.430
 think the super super nice so that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.320
 fits perfectly 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.820
 and if you want to know how you are 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.680
 make your own rings then look 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.269

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.860
