legs the ball is in your right again
and<00:02:05.979> at<00:02:06.729> this<00:02:06.939> point<00:02:07.240> you'll<00:02:07.479> be<00:02:07.509> facing<00:02:07.810> this

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and at this point you'll be facing this

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.460 
and at this point you'll be facing this
direction<00:02:09.090> okay<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:11.200> leg<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.760> legs<00:02:13.470> now

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.410 
you have the ball in your right hand and
this<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.330> where<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.660> spin<00:02:16.930> comes<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.380> spin

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
this is where the spin comes in spin

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.420 
this is where the spin comes in spin
Oh<00:02:19.450> answer<00:02:20.410> you're<00:02:20.530> faking<00:02:20.890> your<00:02:20.950> defender

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
Oh answer you're faking your defender

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.050 
Oh answer you're faking your defender
again<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:23.080> move<00:02:23.319> works<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:24.220> when<00:02:24.910> you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
again this move works because when you

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.949 
again this move works because when you
spin<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.520> shoulder<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.330> your<00:02:28.510> vault<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
spin you shoulder this in your vault the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.290 
spin you shoulder this in your vault the
ball<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.250> kind<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.550> do<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:30.730> sort<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
ball then you kind of do like sort of a

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.720 
ball then you kind of do like sort of a
hurricane<00:02:31.510> move<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.530> hot<00:02:32.920> sauce<00:02:33.190> created

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
hurricane move that hot sauce created
