00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
would need sponge painting brushes the

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.689 
would need sponge painting brushes the
smaller<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.379> brush<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.100> better<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.489> brush

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
smaller the brush the better the brush

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.389 
smaller the brush the better the brush
is<00:00:37.910> in<00:00:38.179> my<00:00:38.329> opinion<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.260> of<00:00:39.800> course<00:00:40.070> you<00:00:40.219> would

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
is in my opinion and of course you would

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.180 
is in my opinion and of course you would
need<00:00:40.579> modge<00:00:40.940> podge<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.960> it's<00:00:42.739> different<00:00:43.010> type

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
need modge podge and it's different type

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.130 
need modge podge and it's different type
of<00:00:43.219> modge<00:00:43.519> podge<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.210> can<00:00:44.390> use<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:44.929> one

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
of modge podge that you can use this one

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.020 
of modge podge that you can use this one
is<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.440> matting<00:00:45.679> one<00:00:45.949> that<00:00:46.100> I'm<00:00:46.219> using<00:00:46.489> and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
is the matting one that I'm using and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.259 
is the matting one that I'm using and
you<00:00:47.750> can<00:00:47.780> also<00:00:48.050> use<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.530> glossy<00:00:48.949> one<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.059> you

you can also use the glossy one and you

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.130 
you can also use the glossy one and you
will<00:00:50.420> need<00:00:50.570> one<00:00:51.410> or<00:00:51.769> two<00:00:52.390> wine<00:00:53.390> bottles<00:00:53.899> it

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
will need one or two wine bottles it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.299 
will need one or two wine bottles it
depends<00:00:54.649> on<00:00:56.109> how<00:00:57.109> you<00:00:57.170> redoing<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.829> project

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
depends on how you redoing this project

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.819 
depends on how you redoing this project
but<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.760> wine<00:00:58.940> by<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.239> wine<00:00:59.809> bottle<00:01:00.440> is

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
but the wine by a wine bottle is

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
until you get the color that you're

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.470 
until you get the color that you're
looking<00:02:10.009> for

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
looking for

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.760 
looking for
after<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> shoe<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.110> completely<00:02:13.740> drying<00:02:15.770> who

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
after the shoe is completely drying who

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.210 
after the shoe is completely drying who
you<00:02:17.100> wanna<00:02:18.320> paint<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.470> bottom<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> shoe

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you wanna paint the bottom of the shoe

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.920 
you wanna paint the bottom of the shoe
with<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.670> Mod<00:02:20.940> Podge<00:02:22.940> when<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> did<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.690> first

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
with the Mod Podge when I did the first

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.020 
with the Mod Podge when I did the first
coat<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.500> Mod<00:02:25.680> Podge<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.490> bottom<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.910> your

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.440 
coat of Mod Podge the bottom of your
shoe<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.600> think<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.500> let<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.830> dry<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:30.260> maybe<00:02:32.450> 50

shoe I think I let it dry for maybe 50

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.550 
shoe I think I let it dry for maybe 50
minutes<00:02:33.870> or<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:36.000> think<00:02:36.210> of<00:02:36.570> them<00:02:36.720> three

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
minutes or so and I think of them three

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.610 
minutes or so and I think of them three
coats<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.100> Mod<00:02:38.520> Podge<00:02:38.910> also<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> bottom<00:02:40.500> of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
coats of Mod Podge also at the bottom of

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.790 
coats of Mod Podge also at the bottom of
the<00:02:40.710> shoe<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.490> be<00:02:42.390> sure<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:43.140> really<00:02:43.470> wanted

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
the shoe just to be sure I really wanted

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.560 
the shoe just to be sure I really wanted
to<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:44.130> sealed<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.270> eye<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> paint

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
to be sealed in and one eye in a paint

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.880 
to be sealed in and one eye in a paint
coming<00:02:48.570> off<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.960> bottom<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.290> my<00:02:49.440> shoe<00:02:49.650> of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
coming off the bottom of my shoe of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.400 
coming off the bottom of my shoe of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
course it's gonna come off the court

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.930 
course it's gonna come off the court
under<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.560> platform<00:02:53.120> when<00:02:54.120> you're<00:02:54.300> walking

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
under the platform when you're walking

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.780 
under the platform when you're walking
so<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.630> decide<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.440> dy<00:02:58.860> project<00:02:59.640> I

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
so if you decide to do this dy project I

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.430 
so if you decide to do this dy project I
mean<00:02:59.970> there's<00:03:00.360> many<00:03:00.570> ways<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:00.930> do<00:03:01.230> it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
mean there's many ways you can do it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.650 
mean there's many ways you can do it
it's<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> way<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.000> did<00:03:03.330> it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
it's just the way that I do it I did it

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.510 
it's just the way that I do it I did it
because<00:03:04.410> like<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.650> say<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.100> old<00:03:05.310> pair

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
because like I say this is the old pair

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.070 
because like I say this is the old pair
of<00:03:05.610> shoes<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.940> really<00:03:06.240> didn't<00:03:06.480> care<00:03:06.660> if<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080

I<00:04:04.050> took<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.260> photo<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:05.070> think<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.760> was<00:04:05.910> um<00:04:06.209> like

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
I took that photo I think it was um like

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.520 
I took that photo I think it was um like
after<00:04:07.380> one<00:04:07.590> day<00:04:07.830> or<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.750> was<00:04:09.959> totally

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
after one day or so and it was totally

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.570 
after one day or so and it was totally
dry<00:04:10.770> but<00:04:11.160> today<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.360> be<00:04:12.480> sure<00:04:13.580> that

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
dry but today is just to be sure that

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.909 
dry but today is just to be sure that
it's<00:04:14.820> like<00:04:15.090> drying<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:16.020> really<00:04:16.410> still<00:04:16.650> thin

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
it's like drying is really still thin

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.659 
it's like drying is really still thin
like<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.549> think<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.450> has<00:04:18.630> been<00:04:18.840> maybe<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:20.100> week<00:04:20.489> or

like I think it has been maybe a week or

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.590 
like I think it has been maybe a week or
