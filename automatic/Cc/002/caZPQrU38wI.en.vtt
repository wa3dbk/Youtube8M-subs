00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello my name is benjamin aillaud and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.220
 I come today with text you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.259
 talk about starting at gallop the start at 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.790
 gallop in a young horse does not 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.570
 practice not directly from the stop or 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.029
 but not the first step, will fall 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 in the gallop from the trot then we 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.199
 will try to come back from galloping to trot 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.090
 then trot galloping 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.800
 if you split this work there you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.199
 reward your horse at each of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 these steps there he will understand it and will have 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.140
 not feel like being attacked for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.490
 go galloping 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.080
 already starting from the trot if your too 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.390
 before galloping and too much 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.160
 fast and we talk about speed the young 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.720
 horse because we have not yet 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 installed yet a cadence 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.100
 if your too much and too fast you will have 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 difficulties for the horse to go 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.830
 in the gallops so work in a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 too much that looks like too much work 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.370
 who is not yet between work 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.630
 defined in the young horse but in 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.910
 too much that does not go too fast 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.650
 do not hesitate to slow it down a bit before 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.780
 to ask the horse to leave 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.450
 megalo the downward transition of the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.340
 gallop trot will be more in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.429
 asking the horse a calm 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.469
 use even at the beginning the voice straighten 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.810
 your shoulders nicely and to fall the 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.609
 transition even though it puts a little more 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 Has time does not seek it 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.899
 directly at the beginning with your hands you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 will create disorder and battle and 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.619
 the horse would not understand everything 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.159
 simply that the exercise is not 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.619
 harmless 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.689
 we just need the horse 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.429
 understand that duga the other 's trot or 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.710
 gallop for something that is 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.590
 goes into comfort start with 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.439
 install your young horse trotting on 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.569
 a regular curve on a circle the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.689
 widest possible because your 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.270
 horse is posed nicely the most 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.729
 possible dancing takes it you have 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.929
 the impression that he is serene 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.569
 once you have it in one 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.460
 correct attitude 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.819
 installed at that moment comes the time 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.219
 from the galloping start to prepare for his departure 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.899
 at a gallop I'm going to think about the aids that I 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.509
 will apply I'm going to think back 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.040
 my shoulders back my shoulders to me 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:19.790
 sit down is requested 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:22.640
 well then to pass the transition 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.329
 descending game would recede my shoulders 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.129
 and at the voice I will assist my horse 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:33.530
 pot and I'm waiting for the transition once 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.530
 that the transition is past I come back 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.010
 installed my horse the nicest 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.950
 possible in the hole I do not hesitate 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.069
 in my trotting job has changed from 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.069
 hands 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.310
 1 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.820
 once the change of hands is 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.460
 past that the horse is installed in the 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.890
 work too much right now it's time 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.370
 to sit down and ask for the departure 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.370
 great 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.520
 yeah 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.989
 same exercise to ask for the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.180
 downward transition 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.730
 once the horse is installed in 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.760
 his gallop requested the transition 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.150
 downward gently back down your 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.670
 shoulders 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.780
 wait for the transition here you go 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.530
 do not forget once you have 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.989
 got or once you got 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.609
 a correct exercise rewarded letting go 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.180
 the reins because here in our second 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.090
 step 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.370
 we will see the transitions gallo daddy 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.599
 gallop I remind you for all 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.329
 transitions in gallo whether it's at 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.340
 trotting or walking to gallop 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.159
 helps his body weight slightly to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.169
 the outside outer leg slightly 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.599
 backward and outward slightly 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.639
 to move back forward the skins inside and 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:12.819
 the start will be given by the agent 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:15.069
 inside we went to prepare 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.199
 your galloping start body weight 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.030
 slightly outside pull back the 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.519
 outer leg pull back the poles 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.000
 outside drag your legs is 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.000
 galloping 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:40.120
 then ironed at the pace gently stroking 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.650
 let go of the reins let the horse 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.650
 stretch and start again 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.529
 if during the galloping start your 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.809
 horse is crossing 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.270
 that is to say but his hips to 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:58.969
 inside at that moment that's all 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.520
 simply because between the moment 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.050
 you asked for the beginning of your 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.050
 galloping start and the moment you are 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.330
 left you took too long to 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.459
 to know if when you step back your leg 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.800
 outside your leg inside did not 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.779
 not already close to the horse to ask 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.879
 so the horse just thinks it takes 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.099
 put her hips inside for 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.619
 remove this problem from the horse 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.869
 that just goes through before 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:27.110
 your departure gallo keep your legs at 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:29.449
 contact then advance your leg 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.979
 inside pull back your outer leg 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.110
 is very fast 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.879
 ask your inner leg to 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.999
 give the go do not waste time 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:39.080
 between the beginning of the action and the top 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.240
 to go galloping 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.229
 it's just that time that makes 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.729
 that your horse is going through six on a 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.209
 horse that has become accustomed to those 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.369
 crossed 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.379
 I propose you to gallop at 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:54.740
 fake along the wall and use the wall 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.749
 to channel the angels with that your 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.569
 horse should go at a gallop in order 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:02.889
 calm and above all right 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.889
 have fun and see you soon
