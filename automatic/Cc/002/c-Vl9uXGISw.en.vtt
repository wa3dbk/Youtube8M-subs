school<00:04:40.140> more<00:04:40.350> in<00:04:40.500> my<00:04:40.680> opinion<00:04:41.090> anyway<00:04:42.090> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
school more in my opinion anyway the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.680

match ratings Negredo got 7.2 and and
Hernandez<00:04:46.410> 8.3<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:47.670> gives<00:04:47.880> Hernandez<00:04:48.660> a

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
Hernandez 8.3 so that gives Hernandez a

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.140 
Hernandez 8.3 so that gives Hernandez a
big<00:04:49.170> lead<00:04:49.500> going<00:04:49.950> in<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.130> game<00:04:50.310> three<00:04:50.670> so

big lead going in the game three so

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.670 
big lead going in the game three so
it'll<00:04:51.330> make<00:04:51.480> things<00:04:51.660> interesting<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.440> see<00:04:52.590> if

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
it'll make things interesting to see if

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.100 
it'll make things interesting to see if
Negredo<00:04:53.070> can<00:04:53.400> pull<00:04:53.640> it<00:04:53.730> back<00:04:53.910> he<00:04:54.570> had<00:04:54.720> seven

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
18 on target so yeah I think I did

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.690 
18 on target so yeah I think I did
definitely<00:05:01.140> deserve<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.620> win<00:05:01.770> but<00:05:02.370> anyway

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
definitely deserve the win but anyway

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:54.490 
definitely deserve the win but anyway
going<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.570> game<00:05:03.720> three<00:05:04.020> now

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:02.640

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.740 
okay so that ended in a 2-1 loss I
probably<00:06:06.530> did<00:06:06.830> deserve<00:06:07.130> to<00:06:07.340> lose<00:06:07.520> not<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.540> lot

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
probably did deserve to lose not a lot

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.570 
probably did deserve to lose not a lot
happen<00:06:09.170> throughout<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:09.680> game<00:06:09.950> like<00:06:10.370> there

deflected<00:06:12.770> it<00:06:13.040> was<00:06:13.160> very<00:06:13.700> very<00:06:13.970> dull<00:06:14.360> game

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
deflected it was very very dull game

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.400 
deflected it was very very dull game
glad<00:06:15.410> it's<00:06:15.650> finished<00:06:16.480> anyway<00:06:17.480> the<00:06:18.200> match

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.760 
ratings Negredo got 6.6 and Hernandez
6.5<00:06:22.790> so<00:06:23.120> that<00:06:23.270> does<00:06:23.600> make<00:06:23.780> it<00:06:24.020> pretty<00:06:24.320> clear<00:06:24.620> to

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
6.5 so that does make it pretty clear to

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.530 
6.5 so that does make it pretty clear to
see<00:06:24.920> who's<00:06:25.160> went<00:06:25.460> through<00:06:25.730> but<00:06:25.970> I'll<00:06:26.120> do<00:06:26.330> the

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
see who's went through but I'll do the

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.160 
see who's went through but I'll do the
review<00:06:26.810> the<00:06:26.990> end<00:06:27.140> as<00:06:27.410> always<00:06:28.250> I<00:06:28.550> had<00:06:29.510> nine

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
review the end as always I had nine

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.950 
review the end as always I had nine
shots<00:06:30.590> five<00:06:30.950> on<00:06:31.160> target<00:06:31.550> here<00:06:31.580> at<00:06:31.850> 15<00:06:32.330> and<00:06:32.600> 9<00:06:32.780> on

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
shots five on target here at 15 and 9 on

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.570 
shots five on target here at 15 and 9 on
target<00:06:33.410> as<00:06:33.590> I<00:06:33.620> say<00:06:33.980> a<00:06:34.010> lot<00:06:34.220> of<00:06:34.310> there<00:06:34.460> were

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
target as I say a lot of there were

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.430 
target as I say a lot of there were
deflections<00:06:35.210> it<00:06:35.390> was<00:06:35.510> a<00:06:35.540> pretty<00:06:35.780> boring<00:06:36.140> game

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
deflections it was a pretty boring game

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.020 
deflections it was a pretty boring game
but<00:06:36.770> anyway<00:06:37.040> let's<00:06:37.280> just<00:06:37.490> head<00:06:37.640> straight<00:06:37.760> into

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
but anyway let's just head straight into

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.730 
but anyway let's just head straight into
the<00:06:38.120> review<00:06:39.100> okay<00:06:40.100> but<00:06:40.790> for<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.150> review<00:06:41.590> as<00:06:42.590> I

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
the review okay but for the review as I

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.140 
the review okay but for the review as I
said<00:06:42.800> before<00:06:43.010> I<00:06:43.340> think<00:06:43.430> it's<00:06:43.730> fairly<00:06:44.000> obvious

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
said before I think it's fairly obvious

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.360 
said before I think it's fairly obvious
who's<00:06:44.600> went<00:06:44.810> through<00:06:45.050> but<00:06:45.380> I'll<00:06:45.650> do<00:06:46.040> it<00:06:46.070> as

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
who's went through but I'll do it as

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.350 
who's went through but I'll do it as
always<00:06:46.880> in<00:06:47.420> Game<00:06:47.810> one<00:06:48.110> Negredo<00:06:48.830> go<00:06:49.250> 8.1<00:06:50.090> and

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
always in Game one Negredo go 8.1 and

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.550 
always in Game one Negredo go 8.1 and
Hernandez<00:06:51.170> got<00:06:51.580> 8.1<00:06:52.580> in<00:06:52.880> Game<00:06:53.570> two<00:06:53.600> Negredo

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
Hernandez got 8.1 in Game two Negredo

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.560 
Hernandez got 8.1 in Game two Negredo
got<00:06:54.980> 7.2<00:06:55.910> and<00:06:56.180> and<00:06:56.660> is<00:06:57.100> 8.3<00:06:58.100> in<00:06:58.400> Game<00:06:59.120> three

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
got 7.2 and and is 8.3 in Game three

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.290 
got 7.2 and and is 8.3 in Game three
Negredo<00:07:00.290> got<00:07:01.000> 6.6<00:07:02.000> and<00:07:02.690> now<00:07:02.840> there's<00:07:03.080> got<00:07:03.410> 6.5

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
Negredo got 6.6 and now there's got 6.5

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.400 
Negredo got 6.6 and now there's got 6.5
so<00:07:05.300> on<00:07:05.720> average<00:07:06.640> Negredo<00:07:07.640> got<00:07:08.140> 7.3<00:07:09.140> and

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
so on average Negredo got 7.3 and

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.110 
so on average Negredo got 7.3 and
Hernandez<00:07:11.260> 7.63<00:07:12.260> so<00:07:13.190> that<00:07:13.340> does<00:07:13.610> mean<00:07:13.850> that

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
Hernandez 7.63 so that does mean that

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.580 
Hernandez 7.63 so that does mean that
for<00:07:14.840> this<00:07:14.960> game<00:07:15.170> Hernandez<00:07:15.890> is<00:07:16.130> the<00:07:16.460> victor

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
for this game Hernandez is the victor

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.420 
for this game Hernandez is the victor
next<00:07:18.590> game<00:07:18.770> will<00:07:19.310> be<00:07:19.570> Remy<00:07:20.570> vs.<00:07:21.110> Lukaku<00:07:21.710> so

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
next game will be Remy vs. Lukaku so

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.490 
next game will be Remy vs. Lukaku so
that<00:07:22.940> should<00:07:23.300> be<00:07:23.330> pretty<00:07:23.450> good<00:07:23.870> because<00:07:24.260> one

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
that should be pretty good because one

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.370 
that should be pretty good because one
is<00:07:24.800> Pacey<00:07:25.280> and<00:07:25.700> one<00:07:26.000> is<00:07:26.150> strong<00:07:26.540> so<00:07:26.930> we'll<00:07:27.170> see

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 
is Pacey and one is strong so we'll see

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.890 
is Pacey and one is strong so we'll see
which<00:07:27.680> is<00:07:28.010> really<00:07:28.880> more<00:07:29.090> important<00:07:29.510> in<00:07:29.600> fifa

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:29.900 
which is really more important in fifa

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.750
