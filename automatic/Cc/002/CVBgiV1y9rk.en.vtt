00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
spawn you can see them spawning right

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.080 
spawn you can see them spawning right
there<00:02:22.010> practically<00:02:22.520> in<00:02:22.640> front<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:22.880> your<00:02:22.940> gun

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090

so that's pretty helpful heading back
over<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.130> mid<00:02:25.280> map<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:25.550> pretty<00:02:25.760> much<00:02:25.850> covered

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
over in a mid map we pretty much covered
