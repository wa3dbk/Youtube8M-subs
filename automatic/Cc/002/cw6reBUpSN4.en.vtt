00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.150 
walk and I'll talk to you about a cool
concept<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> first<00:00:55.289> strategy<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.920> would

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
concept so the first strategy I would

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
concept so the first strategy I would
like<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> talk<00:00:56.670> about<00:00:56.730> today<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.600> improvising

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
like to talk about today is improvising

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
like to talk about today is improvising
using<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.250> string<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.090> string

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
using one string and one string

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.349 
using one string and one string
exclusively<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:02.070> might<00:01:02.250> wonder<00:01:02.460> why<00:01:02.820> we

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
exclusively you might wonder why we

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.929 
exclusively you might wonder why we
would<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:03.750> about<00:01:04.439> improvising<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.760> one

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
would go about improvising on just one

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
would go about improvising on just one
string<00:01:06.360> well<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> reason<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
string well the reason is because it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.730 
string well the reason is because it
forces<00:01:08.549> us<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.850> think<00:01:09.030> melodically<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.439> can't

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
forces us to think melodically we can't

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.890 
forces us to think melodically we can't
play<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.490> stuff<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.030> our<00:01:12.240> finger<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
play the stuff that our finger is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
play the stuff that our finger is
normally<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.680> trained<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.030> our

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
normally are trained to do like our

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.850 
normally are trained to do like our
licks<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> things<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.229> practiced<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
licks and things we practiced with a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
licks and things we practiced with a
metronome<00:01:17.250> 100<00:01:17.790> times<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.450> we're<00:01:18.720> playing<00:01:18.930> on

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
metronome 100 times if we're playing on

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.950 
metronome 100 times if we're playing on
one<00:01:19.439> string<00:01:19.860> alone<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.549> forces<00:01:21.299> us<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> slow

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
one string alone it forces us to slow

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.179 
one string alone it forces us to slow
things<00:01:22.229> down<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.930> really<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.170> about<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
things down and really think about the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880 
things down and really think about the
melodic<00:01:26.670> content<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:27.900> we're<00:01:28.020> playing<00:01:28.259> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
melodic content of what we're playing so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
melodic content of what we're playing so
now<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> improvise<00:01:29.759> using<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.570> my

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
now I'm going to improvise using just my

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.039 
now I'm going to improvise using just my
g<00:01:31.259> string<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> key<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> E<00:01:32.520> minor<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.119> hope

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
g string in the key of E minor I hope

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.990 
g string in the key of E minor I hope
that<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> give<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.860> try<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that you give this a try and see what it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.429 
that you give this a try and see what it
does<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.570> play<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> be

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
does for your play you have to be

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.280 
does for your play you have to be
patient<00:01:37.920> though<00:01:38.180> stick<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.689> string<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
patient though stick to one string at a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.679 
patient though stick to one string at a
time<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:40.860> give<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> fair<00:01:41.970> chance<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
time and really give it a fair chance it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.539 
time and really give it a fair chance it
might<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.020> frustrating<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:43.680> first<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.310> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
might be frustrating at first but I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.969 
might be frustrating at first but I
think<00:01:44.970> soon<00:01:45.210> you'll<00:01:45.420> realize<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.320> helps

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
think soon you'll realize that it helps

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.819 
think soon you'll realize that it helps
you<00:01:47.579> develop<00:01:47.850> lots<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.450> new<00:01:48.630> melenik<00:01:49.259> melodic

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
you develop lots of new melenik melodic

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.859 
you develop lots of new melenik melodic
ideas<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.520> change<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.360> playing<00:01:51.600> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
ideas and change your playing in

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
now and then it's good to do some really

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.300 
now and then it's good to do some really
weird<00:04:04.690> notes<00:04:05.050> or<00:04:05.260> actually<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.890> know<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.040> found

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310

lately<00:04:06.670> that<00:04:06.820> I'm<00:04:06.940> playing<00:04:07.180> more<00:04:07.420> weird<00:04:07.690> notes

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
lately that I'm playing more weird notes

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.640 
lately that I'm playing more weird notes
than<00:04:08.320> than<00:04:09.160> regular<00:04:09.520> ones<00:04:10.030> but<00:04:10.450> whatever<00:04:10.990> it's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650

than than regular ones but whatever it's
probably<00:04:11.980> just<00:04:12.040> because<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.490> candy

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970
