00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
vibrant colors add a new dimension to

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.570 
vibrant colors add a new dimension to
gaming<00:01:02.540> so<00:01:03.540> yeah<00:01:04.040> well<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> guess<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.519> you're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
gaming so yeah well I guess if you're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.010 
gaming so yeah well I guess if you're
going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> stare<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.299> controller<00:01:06.780> when

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
going to stare at your controller when

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.940 
going to stare at your controller when
you're<00:01:07.140> playing<00:01:08.180> but<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.420> don't<00:01:10.080> see<00:01:10.470> how<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you're playing but I don't see how that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.190 
you're playing but I don't see how that
would<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.520> useful

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
would be useful

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
would be useful
next<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.350> three<00:01:13.710> modes<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> afterglow

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
next up three modes of afterglow

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.780 
next up three modes of afterglow
lighting<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.630> any<00:01:15.810> mood<00:01:16.430> on/off<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
lighting for any mood on/off and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.179 
lighting for any mood on/off and
vibration<00:01:18.750> I'll<00:01:19.500> talk<00:01:19.680> about<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.009> vibration

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
vibration I'll talk about the vibration

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.899 
vibration I'll talk about the vibration
mode<00:01:20.790> later<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.509> let's<00:01:21.990> move<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
mode later on let's move on here

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
mode later on let's move on here
hardcore<00:01:23.909> gamer<00:01:24.240> control<00:01:24.719> layout<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.289> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
hardcore gamer control layout for the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
hardcore gamer control layout for the
competitive<00:01:25.979> edge<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.789> that<00:01:26.820> one's<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.359> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
competitive edge so that one's kind of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.840 
competitive edge so that one's kind of
confusing<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.409> me<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.399> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
confusing to me because it's just the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.810 
confusing to me because it's just the
360<00:01:30.539> layout<00:01:30.929> so<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.649> don't<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.670> they're

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
360 layout so I don't know if they're

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
360 layout so I don't know if they're
trying<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.090> say<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.659> ps3<00:01:34.170> layout<00:01:34.469> is<00:01:34.710> not

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
trying to say that the ps3 layout is not

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
trying to say that the ps3 layout is not
competitive<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.880> something<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.479> don't<00:01:36.689> know

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
purple or the blue but they didn't have

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.109 
purple or the blue but they didn't have
it<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.909> only<00:01:54.090> had<00:01:54.299> green<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.170> yeah<00:01:55.409> whatever

alright<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.479> moving<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> controller

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
alright so moving on to this controller

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
alright so moving on to this controller
it's<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.969> little<00:02:00.240> bit<00:02:00.329> bigger<00:02:00.569> than<00:02:00.749> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it's a little bit bigger than the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.199 
it's a little bit bigger than the
PlayStation<00:02:01.139> 3<00:02:01.770> controller<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.729> much

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
PlayStation 3 controller but it's much

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.289 
PlayStation 3 controller but it's much
smaller<00:02:03.659> than<00:02:03.959> the<00:02:04.139> 360s<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.639> definitely

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
smaller than the 360s it definitely

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.469 
smaller than the 360s it definitely
feels<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.929> lot<00:02:07.439> more<00:02:07.640> durable<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:08.940> snake

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
feels a lot more durable than the snake

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
feels a lot more durable than the snake
bike<00:02:09.750> controller<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.500> don't<00:02:11.039> think<00:02:11.190> it'll

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
bike controller I don't think it'll

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.760 
bike controller I don't think it'll
break<00:02:11.580> anytime<00:02:11.880> soon<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.930> buttons<00:02:13.319> are<00:02:13.470> great

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
break anytime soon the buttons are great

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.610 
break anytime soon the buttons are great
they<00:02:14.220> work<00:02:14.430> perfectly<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.810> trigger<00:02:16.170> buttons

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
they work perfectly the trigger buttons

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.800 
they work perfectly the trigger buttons
are<00:02:16.860> made<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.670> your<00:02:17.910> fingers<00:02:18.480> don't

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
are made so that your fingers don't

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.900 
are made so that your fingers don't
slide<00:02:19.440> off<00:02:19.470> when<00:02:20.100> you're<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.400> holding<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
slide off when you're like holding the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.110 
slide off when you're like holding the
button<00:02:21.270> down<00:02:21.800> but<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.830> never<00:02:23.100> had<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.550> problem

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
button down but I never had this problem

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.730 
button down but I never had this problem
to<00:02:24.300> begin<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> other<00:02:25.050> controller<00:02:25.500> so

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
to begin with on the other controller so

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.940 
to begin with on the other controller so
it<00:02:25.830> doesn't<00:02:26.160> matter<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.450> me<00:02:27.569> at<00:02:27.689> all<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:28.709> thing

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
it doesn't matter to me at all one thing

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.789 
it doesn't matter to me at all one thing
that's<00:02:29.159> kind<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.030> weird<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.720> me<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.620> the

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
that's kind of weird to me is that the

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:32.360 
that's kind of weird to me is that the
face

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
face

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.030 
face
buttons<00:02:32.700> are<00:02:33.080> smaller<00:02:34.080> than<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.500> dual<00:02:34.680> shocks

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
buttons are smaller than the dual shocks

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.460 
buttons are smaller than the dual shocks
like<00:02:35.280> let's<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.510> show<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.840> here<00:02:37.260> if

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
like let's see if I can show you here if

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.320 
like let's see if I can show you here if
you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.799> tell<00:02:38.099> but<00:02:38.400> they're<00:02:39.980> smaller<00:02:41.120> I'm<00:02:42.120> not

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
you can tell but they're smaller I'm not

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.690 
you can tell but they're smaller I'm not
sure<00:02:42.629> why<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:43.049> did<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.069> never

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
sure why they did that but I never

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.520 
sure why they did that but I never
noticed<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.269> while<00:02:45.450> playing<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.230> doesn't

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
noticed it while playing so it doesn't

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.130 
noticed it while playing so it doesn't
really<00:02:46.709> matter<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.340> all<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.420> analogs<00:02:48.930> are

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
really matter at all the analogs are

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.399 
really matter at all the analogs are
like<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.530> 360s<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.700> are<00:02:50.959> concave<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
like the 360s they are concave and

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.490 
like the 360s they are concave and
offset<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:54.030> not<00:02:54.269> really<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.569> fan<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.140> style

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
offset I'm not really a fan of the style

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.039 
offset I'm not really a fan of the style
I<00:02:55.769> love<00:02:56.069> convex<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.970> on-set<00:02:57.420> analogues<00:02:57.870> like

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
I love convex and on-set analogues like

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.140 
I love convex and on-set analogues like
the<00:02:58.170> PlayStation<00:02:58.709> 3<00:02:58.950> has<00:02:59.159> but<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.760> know<00:02:59.909> it's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the PlayStation 3 has but you know it's

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.600 
the PlayStation 3 has but you know it's
just<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.450> personal<00:03:00.840> preference<00:03:01.430> also<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
just a personal preference also the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.880 
just a personal preference also the
controller<00:03:03.030> has<00:03:03.269> this<00:03:03.569> design<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.620> back

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
controller has this design on the back

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.910 
controller has this design on the back
and<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:06.239> guess<00:03:06.930> it's<00:03:07.170> supposed<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> make<00:03:07.769> your

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
and I guess it's supposed to make your

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.069 
and I guess it's supposed to make your
hands<00:03:08.220> rest<00:03:08.549> more<00:03:08.819> comfortably<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.870> see

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
hands rest more comfortably like you see

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.339 
hands rest more comfortably like you see
how<00:03:10.260> there's<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:11.209> there<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.239> go<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.690> bump

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
how there's like a there you go a bump

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.270 
how there's like a there you go a bump
out<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:14.090> um<00:03:15.090> at<00:03:15.810> first<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.500> did<00:03:16.709> like<00:03:16.950> this

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
out there um at first I did like this

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.490 
out there um at first I did like this
but<00:03:17.940> after<00:03:18.329> about<00:03:18.870> 30<00:03:19.650> minutes<00:03:19.909> it<00:03:20.909> just

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
but after about 30 minutes it just

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.869 
but after about 30 minutes it just
wasn't<00:03:22.500> working<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:23.010> me<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.519> ended<00:03:23.760> up

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
wasn't working for me and it ended up

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.720 
wasn't working for me and it ended up
starting<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.540> get<00:03:24.659> a<00:03:24.720> little<00:03:24.900> irritating<00:03:25.799> so

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
starting to get a little irritating so

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.149 
starting to get a little irritating so
it's<00:03:26.879> like<00:03:27.060> alright<00:03:27.569> I<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:28.019> use<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.349> fur<00:03:28.950> a

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
it's like alright I can use this fur a

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.670 
it's like alright I can use this fur a
little<00:03:29.220> bit<00:03:29.700> at<00:03:29.849> a<00:03:29.879> time<00:03:29.970> before<00:03:30.780> my<00:03:31.319> hands

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
little bit at a time before my hands

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.809 
little bit at a time before my hands
start<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.250> hurt<00:03:33.060> after<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.989> while<00:03:34.519> now<00:03:35.519> let's

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
start to hurt after a while now let's

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:36.920 
start to hurt after a while now let's
show<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> worst<00:03:36.359> thing<00:03:36.510> about<00:03:36.690> this

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
show you the worst thing about this

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.449 
show you the worst thing about this
controller<00:03:37.380> before<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:37.799> get<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
controller before I get on to the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.699 
controller before I get on to the
lighting<00:03:38.819> effects<00:03:39.150> now<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.049> problem<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.560> have

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
lighting effects now the problem I have

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.589 
lighting effects now the problem I have
with<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.980> controller<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.790> same<00:03:42.120> problem

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
with this controller is the same problem

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.360 
with this controller is the same problem
I<00:03:42.690> had<00:03:42.720> with<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.049> snakebite<00:03:43.410> controller<00:03:44.099> and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
I had with a snakebite controller and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.059 
I had with a snakebite controller and
that<00:03:44.940> being<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.510> analogs<00:03:45.959> while<00:03:46.500> they're<00:03:46.919> not

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
that being the analogs while they're not

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.729 
that being the analogs while they're not
as<00:03:47.310> bad<00:03:47.669> as<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.209> snakebite<00:03:48.480> they're<00:03:49.349> still

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
as bad as the snakebite they're still

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.920 
as bad as the snakebite they're still
pretty<00:03:49.950> horrible<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.090> prom<00:03:51.359> relates<00:03:51.690> to

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
pretty horrible and the prom relates to

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.920 
pretty horrible and the prom relates to
the<00:03:52.079> dead<00:03:52.319> zone<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:53.430> example<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.120> push<00:03:54.510> one

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
the dead zone for example if I push one

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.400 
the dead zone for example if I push one
of<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.169> analogs<00:03:55.620> like<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.280> tiny<00:03:57.180> bit<00:03:57.599> to<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
of the analogs like a tiny bit to the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.650 
of the analogs like a tiny bit to the
left<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:59.099> would<00:03:59.280> be<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.579> exact<00:04:00.030> same<00:04:00.150> if<00:04:00.480> I

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
left it would be the exact same if I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.780 
left it would be the exact same if I
pushed<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.410> all<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.620> way<00:04:01.919> so<00:04:01.949> it's<00:04:02.400> like<00:04:02.579> I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
pushed it all the way so it's like I

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.430 
pushed it all the way so it's like I
don't<00:04:03.150> know<00:04:03.389> how<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.599> explain<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.109> but<00:04:04.319> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
don't know how to explain it but the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.099 
don't know how to explain it but the
sensitivity<00:04:04.829> on<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.549> analogs<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.120> horrible

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
sensitivity on the analogs is horrible

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.229 
sensitivity on the analogs is horrible
and<00:04:07.739> I'll<00:04:07.889> show<00:04:08.129> you<00:04:08.160> an<00:04:08.400> example<00:04:08.790> right<00:04:08.970> now

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
and I'll show you an example right now

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.740 
and I'll show you an example right now
on<00:04:09.900> an<00:04:10.440> actual<00:04:10.829> gameplay<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.699> what<00:04:12.660> I'm

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
on an actual gameplay of what I'm

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.800 
on an actual gameplay of what I'm
talking<00:04:12.989> about<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.970> here's<00:04:15.180> an<00:04:15.299> example<00:04:15.419> of

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
talking about so here's an example of

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.960 
talking about so here's an example of
just<00:04:15.870> how<00:04:16.139> bad<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.410> analogs<00:04:17.010> are<00:04:17.280> first<00:04:17.729> up

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
just how bad the analogs are first up

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.819 
just how bad the analogs are first up
I'll<00:04:18.120> show<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.570> afterglow<00:04:19.079> controller<00:04:19.560> and

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
I'll show the afterglow controller and

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.490 
I'll show the afterglow controller and
then<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:21.120> Sony<00:04:21.449> Dual<00:04:21.780> Shock<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.410> I'm

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
then the Sony Dual Shock and I'm

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.290 
then the Sony Dual Shock and I'm
positive<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.250> you'll<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.610> able<00:04:23.699> to<00:04:23.910> tell<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
positive that you'll be able to tell the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.629 
positive that you'll be able to tell the
difference<00:04:24.330> here<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.169> makes<00:04:25.860> aiming<00:04:26.130> at<00:04:26.340> even

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
difference here it makes aiming at even

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.879 
difference here it makes aiming at even
close<00:04:26.970> range<00:04:27.300> kind<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.870> difficult<00:04:28.289> so<00:04:28.470> imagine

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
close range kind of difficult so imagine

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.650 
close range kind of difficult so imagine
just<00:04:28.919> trying<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.430> snipe<00:04:29.699> a<00:04:29.880> guy<00:04:30.000> at<00:04:30.120> long<00:04:30.389> range

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
just trying to snipe a guy at long range

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.010 
just trying to snipe a guy at long range
it's<00:04:30.990> for<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.070> most<00:04:32.250> part<00:04:32.520> useless<00:04:33.120> this

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
it's for the most part useless this

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.810 
it's for the most part useless this
pretty<00:04:34.410> much<00:04:34.560> ruins<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.160> controller<00:04:35.550> for

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
pretty much ruins the controller for

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.070 
pretty much ruins the controller for
games<00:04:36.030> where<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.360> need<00:04:36.539> you<00:04:36.750> know<00:04:36.870> the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
games where you need you know the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.110 
games where you need you know the
analogs<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.650> be<00:04:37.830> precise<00:04:38.310> like<00:04:38.639> shooters

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
analogs to be precise like shooters

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.570 
analogs to be precise like shooters
racing<00:04:39.900> games<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.560> don't<00:04:41.159> know<00:04:41.370> maybe

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
racing games I don't know maybe

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.060 
racing games I don't know maybe
platformers<00:04:42.479> I<00:04:42.750> think<00:04:43.469> you<00:04:43.620> get<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.890> point

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
platformers I think you get the point

00:04:44.070 --> 00:05:08.720 
platformers I think you get the point
here

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.100 

so<00:05:09.730> finally<00:05:10.180> before<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.660> give<00:05:10.810> my<00:05:10.840> final

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
so finally before I give my final

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.230 
so finally before I give my final
thoughts<00:05:11.500> here's<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.070> light<00:05:12.250> feature<00:05:12.550> now

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
thoughts here's the light feature now

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.940 
thoughts here's the light feature now
give<00:05:13.390> you<00:05:13.480> a<00:05:13.540> warning<00:05:13.870> right<00:05:14.290> before<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.650> turn

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
give you a warning right before I turn

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.690 
give you a warning right before I turn
off<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.310> lights<00:05:16.080> all<00:05:17.080> right<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.560> as<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.490> Box

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
off the lights all right and as the Box

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.840 
off the lights all right and as the Box
States<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.300> has<00:05:19.570> three<00:05:20.050> modes<00:05:20.320> on<00:05:20.850> vibration

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
States it has three modes on vibration

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.960 
States it has three modes on vibration
and<00:05:22.060> off<00:05:22.300> what<00:05:23.140> vibration<00:05:23.770> does<00:05:23.980> is<00:05:24.310> kind<00:05:24.760> of

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
and off what vibration does is kind of

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.300 
and off what vibration does is kind of
disappointing<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.780> me<00:05:25.930> all<00:05:26.230> it<00:05:26.410> does<00:05:26.620> is<00:05:26.950> turn

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
disappointing to me all it does is turn

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.520 
disappointing to me all it does is turn
on<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.520> LEDs<00:05:28.090> each<00:05:28.540> time<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.170> controller

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
on the LEDs each time the controller

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.130 
on the LEDs each time the controller
vibrates<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.280> turns<00:05:30.670> them<00:05:30.880> off<00:05:31.090> for<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.660> second

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
vibrates and turns them off for a second

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.500 
vibrates and turns them off for a second
or<00:05:32.260> two<00:05:32.290> after<00:05:32.920> I<00:05:33.160> was<00:05:33.910> thinking<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.270> maybe

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
or two after I was thinking that maybe

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.690 
or two after I was thinking that maybe
the<00:05:34.720> LEDs<00:05:35.080> would<00:05:35.290> go<00:05:35.470> from<00:05:35.770> dim<00:05:36.100> to<00:05:36.430> bright

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
the LEDs would go from dim to bright

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.760 
the LEDs would go from dim to bright
depending<00:05:37.360> on<00:05:37.450> how<00:05:37.630> long<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.230> vibration

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
depending on how long the vibration

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.400 
depending on how long the vibration
lasts<00:05:39.370> or<00:05:39.520> something<00:05:40.060> like<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.840> don't

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
lasts or something like that I don't

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.110 
lasts or something like that I don't
know<00:05:41.560> it's<00:05:41.740> not<00:05:41.890> really<00:05:42.100> a<00:05:42.130> big<00:05:42.310> deal<00:05:42.370> but<00:05:42.850> it's

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
know it's not really a big deal but it's

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.970 
know it's not really a big deal but it's
something<00:05:43.570> that<00:05:43.720> I<00:05:44.080> don't<00:05:44.230> see<00:05:44.410> myself<00:05:44.620> ever

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
something that I don't see myself ever

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.400 
something that I don't see myself ever
using<00:05:45.760> and<00:05:46.000> I'm<00:05:46.780> going<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.020> turn<00:05:47.140> off<00:05:47.200> the

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
using and I'm going to turn off the

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.170 
using and I'm going to turn off the
lights<00:05:47.620> right<00:05:47.920> now<00:05:48.130> so<00:05:48.370> fair<00:05:48.610> warning<00:05:48.640> it's

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
lights right now so fair warning it's

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.060 
lights right now so fair warning it's
going<00:05:49.420> to<00:05:49.570> be<00:05:49.690> much<00:05:50.110> brighter<00:05:50.410> than<00:05:50.770> what<00:05:50.950> you

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
going to be much brighter than what you

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.490 
going to be much brighter than what you
could<00:05:51.220> probably<00:05:51.460> tell<00:05:51.970> right<00:05:52.270> now<00:05:52.500> depending

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
could probably tell right now depending

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.200 
could probably tell right now depending
on<00:05:53.590> how<00:05:53.650> well<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.310> camera<00:05:54.520> is<00:05:54.700> picking<00:05:54.910> up<00:05:55.180> the

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
on how well the camera is picking up the

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.600 
on how well the camera is picking up the
brightness<00:05:55.510> so<00:05:56.380> yeah<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.950> lighting<00:05:57.250> effects

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
brightness so yeah the lighting effects

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.150 
brightness so yeah the lighting effects
work<00:05:58.000> great<00:05:58.420> it<00:05:58.720> does<00:05:58.990> exactly<00:05:59.590> what<00:06:00.010> it's

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
work great it does exactly what it's

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.070 
work great it does exactly what it's
supposed<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.580> do<00:06:00.790> so<00:06:01.090> there's<00:06:01.330> really<00:06:01.690> not

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
supposed to do so there's really not

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.070 
supposed to do so there's really not
much<00:06:02.590> left<00:06:03.010> to<00:06:03.130> say<00:06:03.430> about<00:06:03.760> it<00:06:04.030> so<00:06:04.300> now<00:06:04.690> I'm

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
much left to say about it so now I'm

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.720 
much left to say about it so now I'm
going<00:06:05.290> to<00:06:05.380> just<00:06:05.560> turn<00:06:05.830> back<00:06:05.890> on<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.520> lights

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
going to just turn back on the lights

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.260 
going to just turn back on the lights
and<00:06:06.970> go<00:06:07.480> with<00:06:07.690> my<00:06:07.840> final<00:06:08.290> thoughts

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
and go with my final thoughts

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.580 
and go with my final thoughts
all<00:06:10.270> right<00:06:10.450> so<00:06:10.570> having<00:06:10.780> said<00:06:11.200> that<00:06:11.230> the

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
all right so having said that the

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.340 
all right so having said that the
controller<00:06:11.980> for<00:06:12.190> 20<00:06:12.520> bucks<00:06:12.760> is<00:06:13.090> miles<00:06:13.930> better

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
controller for 20 bucks is miles better

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.410 
controller for 20 bucks is miles better
than<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.800> snakebite<00:06:15.070> however<00:06:16.060> it's<00:06:16.240> still

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
than the snakebite however it's still

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.360 
than the snakebite however it's still
nowhere<00:06:16.960> near<00:06:17.170> the<00:06:17.560> quality<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.220> dual

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
nowhere near the quality of the dual

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.490 
nowhere near the quality of the dual
shocks<00:06:18.760> my<00:06:19.420> main<00:06:19.600> complaints<00:06:20.140> are<00:06:20.290> that<00:06:20.320> the

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
shocks my main complaints are that the

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.400 
shocks my main complaints are that the
analogs<00:06:20.950> are<00:06:21.190> terrible<00:06:21.820> and<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.660> controller

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
analogs are terrible and the controller

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.550 
analogs are terrible and the controller
handle<00:06:23.950> design<00:06:24.100> is<00:06:25.080> kind<00:06:26.080> of<00:06:26.200> uncomfortable

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
handle design is kind of uncomfortable

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.680 
handle design is kind of uncomfortable
after<00:06:26.950> a<00:06:27.130> while<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:27.670> that<00:06:27.910> could<00:06:28.150> just<00:06:28.180> be<00:06:28.390> how

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
after a while and that could just be how

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.530 
after a while and that could just be how
I<00:06:28.720> hold<00:06:29.170> my<00:06:29.350> controllers<00:06:29.920> so<00:06:30.880> if<00:06:31.120> you<00:06:31.240> play

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
I hold my controllers so if you play

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.660 
I hold my controllers so if you play
games<00:06:31.570> where<00:06:32.260> you<00:06:32.410> don't<00:06:32.680> need<00:06:33.100> to<00:06:33.370> rely<00:06:33.640> on

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
games where you don't need to rely on

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.210 
games where you don't need to rely on
precise<00:06:34.420> movements<00:06:35.140> with<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.350> analogs<00:06:35.890> and

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
precise movements with the analogs and

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.000 
precise movements with the analogs and
don't<00:06:36.850> mind<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.360> handle<00:06:37.750> design<00:06:37.900> then<00:06:38.770> this

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
don't mind the handle design then this

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.730 
don't mind the handle design then this
controller<00:06:39.460> is<00:06:39.700> actually<00:06:40.300> not<00:06:40.540> bad<00:06:40.840> at<00:06:41.260> all

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
controller is actually not bad at all

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.150 
controller is actually not bad at all
the<00:06:42.340> buttons<00:06:42.730> work<00:06:42.940> great<00:06:43.270> it's<00:06:43.710> durable<00:06:44.710> and

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
the buttons work great it's durable and

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.400 
the buttons work great it's durable and
yeah<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.820> lighting<00:06:46.150> effect<00:06:46.510> is<00:06:46.780> gimmicky<00:06:47.110> but

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
yeah the lighting effect is gimmicky but

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.080 
yeah the lighting effect is gimmicky but
you<00:06:47.680> really<00:06:48.070> don't<00:06:48.190> have<00:06:48.400> to<00:06:48.550> use<00:06:48.730> it<00:06:48.880> if<00:06:49.000> you

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
you really don't have to use it if you

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.460 
you really don't have to use it if you
don't<00:06:49.300> want<00:06:49.540> to<00:06:49.720> so<00:06:50.290> what<00:06:50.470> I<00:06:50.500> recommend<00:06:51.040> it

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
don't want to so what I recommend it

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.890 
don't want to so what I recommend it
unless<00:06:53.470> you<00:06:53.950> don't<00:06:54.250> plan<00:06:54.790> on<00:06:55.180> playing<00:06:55.750> the

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
unless you don't plan on playing the

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.160 
unless you don't plan on playing the
type<00:06:56.110> of<00:06:56.140> games<00:06:56.470> I<00:06:56.710> mentioned<00:06:56.770> then<00:06:57.610> maybe<00:06:58.170> but

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
type of games I mentioned then maybe but

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.440 
type of games I mentioned then maybe but
I'd<00:06:59.410> still<00:06:59.800> say<00:07:00.100> save<00:07:00.430> up<00:07:00.610> your<00:07:00.640> money<00:07:00.820> for

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
I'd still say save up your money for

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.720 
I'd still say save up your money for
something<00:07:01.810> better<00:07:02.230> so<00:07:02.980> that's<00:07:03.130> the<00:07:03.400> review

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
something better so that's the review

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.790 
something better so that's the review
thanks<00:07:04.060> for<00:07:04.210> watching<00:07:04.660> and<00:07:04.900> if<00:07:05.170> I<00:07:05.350> keep<00:07:05.620> making

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
thanks for watching and if I keep making

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.890 
thanks for watching and if I keep making
these<00:07:06.070> controller<00:07:06.550> reviews<00:07:07.030> in<00:07:07.360> the<00:07:07.420> future<00:07:07.540> I

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
these controller reviews in the future I

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.870 
these controller reviews in the future I
think<00:07:08.080> what<00:07:08.470> I'm<00:07:08.560> going<00:07:08.710> to<00:07:08.740> do<00:07:08.950> is<00:07:09.220> I'll<00:07:09.490> keep

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
think what I'm going to do is I'll keep

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.280 
think what I'm going to do is I'll keep
getting<00:07:10.240> controllers<00:07:10.750> that<00:07:10.930> are<00:07:11.080> more

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
getting controllers that are more

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.770 
getting controllers that are more
expensive<00:07:11.710> than<00:07:12.070> the<00:07:12.220> last<00:07:12.250> so<00:07:13.150> for<00:07:13.360> example

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
expensive than the last so for example

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.200 
expensive than the last so for example
the<00:07:13.900> snakebite<00:07:14.170> was<00:07:14.560> 10<00:07:14.920> the<00:07:15.550> effort<00:07:15.880> glow<00:07:16.030> was

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 
the snakebite was 10 the effort glow was

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.870 
the snakebite was 10 the effort glow was
20<00:07:16.660> and<00:07:16.780> the<00:07:16.900> next<00:07:17.169> one<00:07:17.320> could<00:07:17.650> be<00:07:17.830> 5<00:07:18.400> or<00:07:18.669> 10

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
20 and the next one could be 5 or 10

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.360 
20 and the next one could be 5 or 10
dollars<00:07:19.060> more<00:07:19.540> expensive<00:07:19.830> just<00:07:20.830> to<00:07:20.980> see<00:07:21.160> how

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
dollars more expensive just to see how

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.050 
dollars more expensive just to see how
much<00:07:21.520> money

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
much money

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.310 
much money
would<00:07:22.150> take<00:07:22.330> to<00:07:22.480> get<00:07:22.570> a<00:07:22.630> controller<00:07:23.050> that's

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
would take to get a controller that's

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.950 
would take to get a controller that's
you<00:07:23.650> know<00:07:23.800> on<00:07:23.980> par<00:07:24.910> or<00:07:25.240> better<00:07:25.450> than<00:07:25.810> the

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
you know on par or better than the

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.070 
you know on par or better than the
DualShock<00:07:26.440> if<00:07:27.190> anyone<00:07:27.639> has<00:07:27.820> any

possibly<00:07:31.870> get<00:07:32.260> a<00:07:32.290> hold<00:07:32.530> of<00:07:32.680> controller<00:07:33.370> thanks

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 
possibly get a hold of controller thanks

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.570 
possibly get a hold of controller thanks
for<00:07:34.240> watching
