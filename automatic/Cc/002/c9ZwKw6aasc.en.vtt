00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.660
 and now he knows how the saw works 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.610
 a tool that applies all of its own 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.370
 force on a minimum surface for 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.320
 cut the wood in seconds the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.800
 miter saw simplifies the operation of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.390
 cutting wood in fact to cut a 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.390
 Axis takes only three seconds at most 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.939
 to achieve a similar performance the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.250
 miter saw concentrates all its strength 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.079
 on a very small surface the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.859
 sharp profile of his teeth 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.859
 circular blade 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.760
 the miter saw specialized in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.969
 concentrate strength with great 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.100
 effectiveness his blade turns 3,500 revolutions 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.899
 per minute and friction with wood 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.659
 releases an enormous amount of heat 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.589
 on the teeth the temperature can reach 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.750
 up to 500 degrees normally to a similar one 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.159
 temperature the metal deforms and the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.409
 wood burns 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.859
 yet the saw blade remains 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.600
 intact and the wood does not catch fire 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.850
 this is because the machine concentrates the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.729
 its strength and is able to manage 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.509
 extreme conditions 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.509
 let's see how it works 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.939
 the miter saw is equipped with a motor 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:18.189
 electric and a steel blade i 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.710
 his teeth are made of carbide of 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.070
 tungsten a material almost as hard 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.070
 the diamond 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.360
 but to understand how the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.790
 miter saw how to resist 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 temperatures generated during cuts 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.720
 we must tear it to pieces 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.000
 when cutting a material the bonds 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.260
 among the molecules that compose it 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 they are broken to cut the wood the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.040
 miter saw must apply to a table 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.030
 a force greater than that which holds 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.030
 together its molecules 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.569
 and the engine release a similar force 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.909
 turns the blade at 200 kilometers per hour 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.230
 each tooth of the circular blade cleaves the 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.230
 wood 60 times per second 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.290
 and whenever this happens or breaks 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.290
 the bonds between the wood molecules 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.689
 but these bonds are very strong and 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.400
 to cut it the machine concentrates 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:57.290
 all the strength of the engine on the profile 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.290
 cutting edge of the circular blade teeth 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.130
 More teeth are their sharp 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.590
 surface will be limited is more 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.930
 surface is limited more concentrated 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.760
 strength will be the more strength is concentrated 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.340
 the easier it will be to break the bonds between 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.020
 molecular properties of wood 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.020
 here's what makes it easy to cut 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.630
 but to generate this force the engine 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.820
 it turns very high speeds and between teeth and 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.820
 in creating a clutch is huge wood 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.430
 the temperature reaches almost 500 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.000
 degrees 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.739
 wood burns at 275 and this should 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.989
 each tooth is a problem 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.540
 remains in contact with the wood only for 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.989
 a sixtieth of a second therefore the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.939
 problem there is time to 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.620
 contact between teeth and axle is too much 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.620
 limited because the wood burns 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.550
 however if the temperature of the teeth 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.100
 the blade rises suddenly 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.640
 overheats and heat causes the 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.890
 metal accordingly in cutting the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.930
 wood the blade expands above all 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.340
 along the lines where the temperature is 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.319
 incandescent 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.950
 at the center instead the temperature remains 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.950
 lower 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.920
 the blade then expands in a non-way 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.239
 homogeneous and this could deform the 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.239
 metal with disastrous effects 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.040
 but thanks to a series of slits 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.310
 practice this expansion in the blade 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.810
 it has no negative consequences 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.460
 in fact the metal to space 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.800
 necessary to expand when yes 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.250
 overheat and contract when 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.250
 cools 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.020
 the blade remains intact despite the 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.040
 changes in temperature that make it e 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.040
 spread during cutting 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.560
 the miter saw concentrates a force 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.180
 immense on a small surface of the 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.070
 blade to break the bonds between the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.350
 wood molecules and is able to 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.110
 manage the extreme temperatures generated 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.090
 from the clutch with wood is one 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.380
 simple application tool but 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.380
 highly sophisticated
