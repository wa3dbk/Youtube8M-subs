00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
very popular with the backlit keyboard

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
very popular with the backlit keyboard
anyway<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.160> page<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> BIOS

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
anyway it's the first page of the BIOS

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.720 
anyway it's the first page of the BIOS
getting<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.840> look<00:00:22.189> and<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
getting a little look and this is just a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550 
getting a little look and this is just a
quick<00:00:23.910> look<00:00:24.180> around<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.930> model<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.500> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
quick look around of this model and you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.759 
quick look around of this model and you
see<00:00:26.490> there<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.330> Nvidia<00:00:29.000> 675<00:00:30.000> m<00:00:30.769> very

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
see there with the Nvidia 675 m very

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.790 
see there with the Nvidia 675 m very
simple<00:00:32.279> standard<00:00:34.010> BIOS<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.880> much<00:00:36.320> Flair<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
simple standard BIOS not much Flair of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.830 
simple standard BIOS not much Flair of
course<00:00:38.329> but<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.660> does<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.250> needed

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
course but it does what what is needed

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.220 
course but it does what what is needed
in<00:00:42.840> order<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.590> everything<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.190> work<00:00:44.340> properly

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
in order for everything to work properly

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.840 
in order for everything to work properly
and<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> first<00:00:47.280> look<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and so this is the first look at the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
and so this is the first look at the
BIOS<00:00:51.110> here's<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.860> look<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
BIOS here's a little look at the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.189 
BIOS here's a little look at the
hardware<00:00:54.260> information<00:00:56.090> for<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> motherboard

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
hardware information for the motherboard

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.190 
hardware information for the motherboard
you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.780> it's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.079> kleva<00:01:01.739> 1<00:01:02.129> 5x<00:01:02.910> e<00:01:04.159> MX

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
you can see it's the kleva 1 5x e MX

you can see it's the kleva 1 5x e MX
