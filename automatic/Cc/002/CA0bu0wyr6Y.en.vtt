00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.850 
but you know with the ball we were very
good<00:03:31.220> at<00:03:31.370> times<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:32.210> very<00:03:32.630> sharp<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.740> that's

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
good at times and very sharp and that's

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.740 
good at times and very sharp and that's
been<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.190> case<00:03:34.220> for<00:03:34.610> boss<00:03:35.000> boss<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.570> year

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
been the case for boss boss of the year

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.720 
been the case for boss boss of the year
so<00:03:35.960> I'm<00:03:36.470> glad<00:03:36.680> they<00:03:36.800> got<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.250> reward<00:03:37.370> that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
so I'm glad they got the reward that

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.490 
so I'm glad they got the reward that
they<00:03:37.820> deserve<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.300> players<00:03:38.540> did<00:03:38.990> words<00:03:39.200> hard

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
they deserve the players did words hard

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.470 
they deserve the players did words hard
and<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:39.920> think<00:03:40.280> would<00:03:40.400> have<00:03:40.520> been<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.640> shame<00:03:40.730> not

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
and I think would have been a shame not

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.260 
and I think would have been a shame not
to<00:03:41.540> lose<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.990> in<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.140> last<00:03:42.740> one<00:03:42.920> verbal<00:03:43.370> pride

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
to lose it in the last one verbal pride

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.110 
to lose it in the last one verbal pride
of<00:03:44.420> them<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.720> was<00:03:44.960> going<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.170> mention<00:03:45.290> either

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
of them I was going to mention either

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.350 
of them I was going to mention either
ends<00:03:47.120> up<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.510> perfect<00:03:47.750> season<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.530> guess

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360
