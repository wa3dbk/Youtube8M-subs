00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you can see this looks you know pretty

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.569 
you can see this looks you know pretty
similar<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> kiwi<00:01:55.140> fruit<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.399> guess

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
similar to like a kiwi fruit and I guess

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
similar to like a kiwi fruit and I guess
you<00:01:56.700> can't<00:01:56.969> grow<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.329> by<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> seeds<00:01:57.960> but

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you can't grow these by the seeds but

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.990 
you can't grow these by the seeds but
most<00:01:58.590> often<00:01:58.829> they're<00:01:59.189> grown<00:01:59.460> by<00:01:59.579> cuttings

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
most often they're grown by cuttings

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
most often they're grown by cuttings
they<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> cactus<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.140> cactus<00:02:01.590> family

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
they are a cactus in the cactus family

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.740 
they are a cactus in the cactus family
and<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.909> way<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> would<00:02:03.240> eat<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and the way you would eat this is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.719 
and the way you would eat this is
basically<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:04.950> once<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> take<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
basically you know once you take this

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.260 
basically you know once you take this
out<00:02:07.310> you'll<00:02:08.310> actually<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.970> there's<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
out you'll actually see there's a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
out you'll actually see there's a
separation<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.170> you'll<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.530> there's<00:02:10.739> here's

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
separation so you'll see there's here's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.059 
separation so you'll see there's here's
the<00:02:11.459> fruit<00:02:11.730> here

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
the fruit here

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.800 
the fruit here
it's<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.819> almost<00:02:13.939> separates<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.689> can

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
it's so it almost separates you can

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
it's so it almost separates you can
almost<00:02:14.900> see<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.319> it'll<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.980> literally<00:02:16.400> come

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
almost see it it'll just literally come

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.240 
almost see it it'll just literally come
out<00:02:16.969> this<00:02:17.840> section<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.739> fruit<00:02:19.069> now<00:02:19.189> you

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
out this section of the fruit now you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.920 
out this section of the fruit now you
can't<00:02:19.579> eat<00:02:19.730> some<00:02:19.909> of<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.060> scrapings<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:20.719> here
