that<00:00:22.119> sort<00:00:22.390> of<00:00:22.449> thing<00:00:22.660> but<00:00:23.110> any<00:00:23.289> rate<00:00:23.529> we've

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
that sort of thing but any rate we've

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.929 
that sort of thing but any rate we've
got<00:00:23.890> some<00:00:24.070> duct<00:00:24.279> tape<00:00:24.489> here<00:00:24.759> and<00:00:25.110> I<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.880> then

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
got some duct tape here and I will then

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.560 
got some duct tape here and I will then
as<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:32.050> someone<00:00:32.550> should<00:00:33.550> be<00:00:33.730> holding<00:00:34.149> the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
as as someone should be holding the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.990 
as as someone should be holding the
compression<00:00:35.110> over<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.590> wound<00:00:35.829> in<00:00:36.129> some<00:00:36.820> way

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
compression over the wound in some way

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.299 
compression over the wound in some way
to<00:00:37.059> keep<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.420> bleeding<00:00:37.870> them<00:00:38.050> we<00:00:38.620> dry<00:00:38.950> off<00:00:39.280> the

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
to keep the bleeding them we dry off the

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.630 
to keep the bleeding them we dry off the
side<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.870> tape<00:00:41.110> will<00:00:41.350> stick<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.860> if

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
side so that the tape will stick and if

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.020 
side so that the tape will stick and if
you<00:00:42.789> have<00:00:42.999> any<00:00:43.300> glue<00:00:44.199> like<00:00:44.800> super<00:00:45.249> glued<00:00:45.579> you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
you have any glue like super glued you

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.930 
you have any glue like super glued you
can<00:00:46.239> apply<00:00:46.719> it<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:46.929> both<00:00:47.800> sides<00:00:47.859> for<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.699> wound

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
can apply it to both sides for the wound

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.720 
can apply it to both sides for the wound
and<00:00:49.329> that's<00:00:50.199> to<00:00:50.559> both<00:00:50.739> sides<00:00:51.039> not<00:00:51.399> in<00:00:51.640> the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
and that's to both sides not in the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.569 
and that's to both sides not in the
middle<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.480> both<00:00:52.659> sides<00:00:52.960> are<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.800> keep<00:00:54.399> the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
middle the both sides are to keep the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.369 
middle the both sides are to keep the
wound<00:00:54.850> from<00:00:57.420> keep<00:00:58.420> keep<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.989> wound<00:00:59.199> together

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
wound from keep keep the wound together

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.459 
wound from keep keep the wound together
better<00:00:59.979> and<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.699> make<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:00.940> teat<00:01:01.179> does<00:01:01.479> tape

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
better and to make the teat does tape

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.410 
better and to make the teat does tape
stick<00:01:02.829> better<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.519> put<00:01:03.729> it<00:01:03.819> on<00:01:03.909> both<00:01:04.150> sides

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
stick better so you put it on both sides

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.060 
stick better so you put it on both sides
of<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.659> wound<00:01:04.870> you<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:10.360> about<00:01:10.930> two<00:01:11.680> inches

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
of the wound you take about two inches

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.930 
of the wound you take about two inches
of<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.520> duct<00:01:12.700> tape<00:01:12.909> tear<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.299> off<00:01:17.520> about<00:01:18.520> 1/4

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
of the duct tape tear it off about 1/4

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.460 
of the duct tape tear it off about 1/4
to<00:01:19.300> 1/2<00:01:20.050> an<00:01:20.500> inch<00:01:20.710> wide<00:01:21.430> grip<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.360> apply<00:01:23.230> it<00:01:23.290> to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
to 1/2 an inch wide grip it apply it to

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.210 
to 1/2 an inch wide grip it apply it to
one<00:01:23.710> side<00:01:23.740> of<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.520> wound<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.860> make<00:01:27.190> sure
