warm place until it double inside the
piece<00:02:36.180> our<00:02:36.390> dough<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.720> ready<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.740> flour<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
piece our dough is ready so flour the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.990 
piece our dough is ready so flour the
benchtop

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
benchtop

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.320 
benchtop
then<00:02:39.990> then<00:02:40.260> put<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.190> dough<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.640> front<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.239> the

then then put the dough in front of the
bench<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:46.220> cut<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.459> into<00:02:47.790> two<00:02:48.330> equal<00:02:49.050> sized

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
bench and cut this into two equal sized

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.670 
bench and cut this into two equal sized
portions<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:53.030> take<00:02:54.030> one<00:02:54.720> part<00:02:55.140> for

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
portions like this and take one part for

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.620 
portions like this and take one part for
the<00:02:55.770> base<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.420> then<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.450> rest<00:02:59.060> roll<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the base and then the rest roll this to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.070 
the base and then the rest roll this to
a<00:03:00.660> rectangular<00:03:01.380> shape<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.330> cut<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.570> dough<00:03:03.810> in

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
a rectangular shape and cut the dough in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.660 
a rectangular shape and cut the dough in
half<00:03:04.130> first<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:06.390> again<00:03:07.220> cut<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.459> dough

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
half first and then again cut the dough

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.580 
half first and then again cut the dough
into<00:03:09.570> equal<00:03:09.810> sized<00:03:10.560> portions<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.930> cut<00:03:13.380> that

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
into equal sized portions so I cut that

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.220 
into equal sized portions so I cut that
into<00:03:13.830> 16<00:03:14.459> equal<00:03:14.700> sized<00:03:15.239> portions<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.080> I'm

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
into 16 equal sized portions and I'm

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.900 
into 16 equal sized portions and I'm
going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> leave<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.799> aside<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
going to leave that aside for the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.110 
going to leave that aside for the
bubbles<00:03:18.450> if<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:19.260> when<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.100> roll<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
bubbles if you when you roll this to a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.840 
bubbles if you when you roll this to a
circle<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.560> leftovers<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.340> can

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
circle if you have leftovers you can

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
circle if you have leftovers you can
take<00:03:24.180> more<00:03:24.540> bubbles<00:03:25.080> out<00:03:25.470> from<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.970> for

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
take more bubbles out from that so for

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.110 
take more bubbles out from that so for
this<00:03:28.049> I'm<00:03:28.380> going<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.799> make<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> circle

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
this I'm going to make this to a circle

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.100 
this I'm going to make this to a circle
I<00:03:30.330> am<00:03:31.230> using<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.860> 12<00:03:32.160> inch<00:03:32.519> pizza<00:03:33.150> pan<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.959> I

I am using a 12 inch pizza pan and I
don't<00:03:34.350> like<00:03:34.590> my<00:03:34.950> crust<00:03:35.340> very<00:03:36.200> thick<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.799> I'm

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
don't like my crust very thick so I'm

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.860 
don't like my crust very thick so I'm
going<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.630> spread<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.860> 12-inch

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
going to spread this on the 12-inch

roll that to a rectangular shape and I

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.360 
roll that to a rectangular shape and I
made<00:04:03.060> these<00:04:03.329> potato<00:04:03.930> balls<00:04:04.310> with<00:04:05.750> mackerel

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.150 

like<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.379> and<00:04:17.209> then<00:04:18.209> you're<00:04:18.449> super<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.470> roll

like this and then you're super and roll
it<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.699> nice<00:04:20.970> ball<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:22.349> leave<00:04:23.099> it<00:04:23.539> around

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
it to a nice ball and leave it around

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.159 
it to a nice ball and leave it around
the<00:04:25.020> edge<00:04:25.229> of<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.680> PISA<00:04:26.129> like<00:04:26.310> this<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:27.720> after

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
the edge of the PISA like this so after

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.589 
the edge of the PISA like this so after
doing<00:04:28.319> the<00:04:28.470> bubbles<00:04:29.129> it<00:04:29.310> will<00:04:29.520> look<00:04:29.729> like<00:04:29.759> this

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
doing the bubbles it will look like this

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.219 
doing the bubbles it will look like this
so<00:04:31.080> prick<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.800> base<00:04:32.460> with<00:04:33.419> a<00:04:33.449> fork

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
so prick the base with a fork

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.850 
so prick the base with a fork
and<00:04:34.349> leave<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.460> again<00:04:35.940> in<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.300> warm<00:04:36.629> place

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
and leave this again in a warm place

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.790 
and leave this again in a warm place
about<00:04:37.860> 15<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.879> 20<00:04:39.300> minutes<00:04:39.659> until<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.379> bubbles

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
about 15 to 20 minutes until the bubbles

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.649 
about 15 to 20 minutes until the bubbles
rise<00:04:41.069> up<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.520> little<00:04:41.699> bit<00:04:43.879> now<00:04:44.879> the<00:04:44.940> piece<00:04:45.389> is

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
rise up a little bit now the piece is

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.260 
rise up a little bit now the piece is
ready<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.379> go<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.830> other<00:04:46.979> so<00:04:47.669> break<00:04:48.090> that

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
ready to go to the other so break that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.589 
ready to go to the other so break that
again<00:04:48.690> using<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.380> fork<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:51.830> will<00:04:52.830> prevent<00:04:53.599> the

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
again using a fork that will prevent the

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:01.370 
again using a fork that will prevent the
pace<00:04:54.870> coming<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.949> when<00:04:56.669> baking<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:59.780> add<00:05:00.780> the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
pace coming up when baking and add the

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:12.230 
pace coming up when baking and add the
tomato<00:05:01.770> sauce<00:05:02.389> onto<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.990> base

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.850 

like<00:05:12.870> this<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:13.669> then<00:05:15.350> what<00:05:16.350> they<00:05:16.530> were<00:05:16.710> the

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
like this and then what they were the

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.719 
like this and then what they were the
feeling<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.639> like<00:05:19.039> I'm<00:05:20.039> going<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.460> top

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
feeling that you like I'm going to top

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.059 
feeling that you like I'm going to top
that<00:05:21.120> with<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:22.099> layer<00:05:23.099> of<00:05:23.130> silverbeet<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:25.740> kids

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
that with a layer of silverbeet the kids
