watt<00:00:53.620> switch<00:00:54.620> here<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.069> I<00:00:55.659> believe<00:00:56.659> that

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
watt switch here and I believe that

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.059 
watt switch here and I believe that
switches<00:00:57.409> between<00:00:57.550> pentode<00:00:58.550> triode<00:01:00.069> deal

with<00:01:01.249> the<00:01:01.339> tubes<00:01:01.839> I'm<00:01:02.839> not<00:01:03.050> an<00:01:03.109> engineer<00:01:03.289> so

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
with the tubes I'm not an engineer so

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.830 
with the tubes I'm not an engineer so
that's<00:01:05.239> basically<00:01:05.540> what<00:01:05.690> they're<00:01:05.810> doing

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
that's basically what they're doing

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.080 
that's basically what they're doing
theirs<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.440> they're<00:01:06.620> using<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.670> switch

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
theirs is they're using that to switch

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.490 
theirs is they're using that to switch
between<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:08.630> lower<00:01:08.810> wattage<00:01:11.140> same<00:01:12.140> energy

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
between the lower wattage same energy

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.820 
between the lower wattage same energy
crank<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:12.920> amp<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.189> little<00:01:13.369> bit<00:01:13.490> more

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
crank the amp a little bit more

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.050 
crank the amp a little bit more

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510
