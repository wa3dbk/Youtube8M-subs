00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.300
 yes I have 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.530
 many old bags 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.130
 bought over the years and 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.330
 Back in the school years, the very good ones 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.270
 not because they were 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.939
 prohibitively expensive so 500 mark and 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.900
 At home is no longer love moped 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.090
 bought and yes and now I want to 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.329
 look what the current school calculator 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.850
 so afford and in this one is from 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.860
 sharp is intuitive to use 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.539
 does not have to memorize so much around 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.530
 but to master that is nevertheless 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.129
 also becomes efficient for the high school graduation 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.289
 approved and also has the nrw 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.370
 admission 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.999
 that's a special one again 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.999
 Requirement 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:07.300
 the device is called kpl 9900 gs 2 that is 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.370
 the current model 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.970
 the instructions you get when you 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:18.830
 the computer retails for about 70 euros 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.899
 including postage and packaging and the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.600
 You also get batteries for that 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.290
 battery that is four times triple so a 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.250
 ha 1 5 volt batteries plus the buffers 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.659
 Battery 2032 is everywhere 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.520
 Technology department store or supermarket 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.579
 what you have to pay attention to as I said 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.479
 this we will take the book then that 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.950
 illustrates that better there is that 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.729
 predecessor model 9900 g 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 You can update that though needs 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.210
 one the link kit for 30 euro for it 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.039
 So you have to buy it then 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.710
 Maybe you should have it anyway 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.450
 the current model as said two 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.130
 and then there are still those 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.320
 only 9900 is needed and that needs 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.490
 you can not buy because they are not 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.459
 updateable these are outdated models 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.659
 with an English speaking 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.230
 user manual so if has the 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.790
 somewhere on ebay or something caught 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.400
 even if you with german instruction 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.989
 I have also seen 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.959
 with whom I am happy because they are 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.069
 not approved for high school 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.629
 and could not, as I said 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.650
 update me so here now myself 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.680
 the computer likes the contrast 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.480
 So I clearly see the difference 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.670
 between the blue buttons and these 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.709
 smaller buttons and also the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:58.840
 Caption is easy to read and yes what 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.370
 So a critic as a marketing gag 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.129
 designated is this turning keyboard 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:10.430
 you can remove the keyboard by 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:16.790
 Follow this little switch 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.579
 pushes down and then become decency 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.730
 instead of the trigonometric functions 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.060
 here the least noticeable sinus 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.139
 cosinus tangens and so on 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.239
 then now on the green keyboard 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.980
 this feature is displayed and that are 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.150
 So break-compute functions 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.280
 bills of numbers in fractions and then 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.060
 again breaks in deetz ii x and 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.459
 vice versa 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:51.500
 and those are all hurry to pay with rest 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:55.040
 if you operate this button that is for 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.409
 secondary level 1 interesting and later 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.319
 if you came further then 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.530
 and was kindly moved one can 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.139
 then so with the higher 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.569
 It only has to deal with mathematics 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.139
 turn around so do not need an extra so the 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.639
 calculator becomes clearer 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.370
 You do not necessarily have to deal with things 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.519
 they still do not know 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.910
 got to 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.599
 then you put it back in there 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.720
 also the advantage I think if the times 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.849
 dirty 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.780
 So if you have something maybe 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:32.009
 over tilts now 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.169
 somehow then you can use the keyboard 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.069
 rausnehmen so I say now have it 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.530
 not tried yet 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:42.990
 you can take them out and better 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.090
 I think so clean 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.569
 big advantage of this calculator 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.180
 I find are the great learning videos which 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.810
 you find on youtube about it I have 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.560
 So there on my website link to it 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.360
 under the video I have the whole 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.979
 left so the whole inserted 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.669
 are interesting and may with her too 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:10.590
 these learning videos and there explains one 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:13.849
 young woman very with a very clear 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.139
 and clear pronunciation and so 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:20.389
 explains all possible bell-clear 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.099
 math problems like 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.180
 Curve discussion and keeps such a zeug 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:30.509
 and statistics and so on and how to do that 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.240
 solves the calculator and that is 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.710
 really worth gold as I think 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.380
 because if you always only with the 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.449
 book has to set apart and that 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.509
 first have to search and so on 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:46.110
 but more difficult and the young with her 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.069
 Explains that to you and then comes 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.599
 So you faster than goal 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:55.020
 yes, I'll be curious once I'll 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:57.440
 different math problems 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.449
 with this and with older computers 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.800
 solve and then look like that in the 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.800
 difference works
