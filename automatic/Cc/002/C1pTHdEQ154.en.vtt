00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.000

My name is Aiman, I'm from Libya.

00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:07.775
My name is Houriya, I'm from Switzerland,

00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:10.405
but originally I'm from Morocco.

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:16.375
Hello, my name is Edward, I'm from China.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.530
Hi, my name is Anuela, I'm from Spain.

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:21.735
I'm Mariko, from Japan.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.420
Margareth, from Brazil. 

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.575

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.770

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.710
What do you think of Dublin?

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:45.435
 I love the people because they are really friendly people. 

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:48.165
The night life in Dublin is wonderful,

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:53.355
it has a lot of pubs, nightclubs, for any taste.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.380
Irish people are very friendly.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:03.795
It's a big and international, historic city.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880
People here are very friendly,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.000
if you have any problem they will give you a hand immediately.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:16.005
Life in the daytime you'll see people going everywhere,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.800
you'll see students, you'll see foreigners, businessmen...

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.070
and the other thing is everything is quite close.

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:26.025
For example, I use my bike to go everywhere.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:32.000
And also I think Dublin is a part of Europe

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.240
 so if you want to go to another country like Spain or France 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.200
you can go really easily because there are really cheap flights.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.470
So, when you check online you can buy a cheap ticket and go whenever you want.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.690
The weather here is so different from Spain but I've got used to it. 

00:01:53.835 --> 00:02:01.600
I am going to miss Dublin a lot but I think it has been a really good experience.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.925
What's your life like in Dublin?

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:12.725
I'm working at a Japanese stationery shop and I'm working as a sales assistant.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.930
When I'm working I speak to Irish people

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.830
and I'm working with Irish people so it's good to improve my English.

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:31.000
I live here in Dublin, in an apartment on O'Connell street, the main street here in Dublin.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.790
It's a big apartment, I live with another friend, he studies here.

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:42.185
I've been here since last February.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.670
We moved here from one year because of my husband's job. 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.910
Yeah, the best beer - Guinness!

00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:53.855
You like it! 

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:56.125
What do you think of English in Dublin?

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:01.325
It just takes me 5 minutes to walk from Stephen's Green Park.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:10.700
Our school fee - it's very reasonable for the quality.  I love my school.

00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:14.000
I have learned a lot of English in this school.

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:31.545
My class is very cosmopolitan.  I have friends from Korea, from Spain too, from Morocco, Brazil, from Argentina and Japan.

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:39.200
English in Dublin is one of the oldest schools in Dublin and it's a reliable school.

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:45.755
I've been in Dublin for four years and always when I renew my visa

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:49.575
I think the administration of the school is very organised,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.760
because I've never had problems.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.765
It's great, it's great to make a friend from school.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.035
What about the teachers and staff?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.830
Teachers here are very friendly and enthusiastic.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:12.170
I think every day they change the subject, so it's never boring! 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.080
My teacher is a really good teacher. 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.000
They're really good, the way that they teach keeps your attention, it's very mixed,

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:28.000
the way that they do things.  And the staff members, they are very helpful and friendly -

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.670
whatever you ask you can get an answer so you sort things out very quickly.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:43.000
If I wanted to recommend my brothers or my cousins to choose this school, 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.100
I would do that without hesitation, because I think this college is very good. 

00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:52.705
Thank you!
