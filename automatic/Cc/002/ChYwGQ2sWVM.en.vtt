00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
patterns you competed on this week which

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.740 
patterns you competed on this week which
was<00:02:55.060> your<00:02:55.210> favorite<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.930> why<00:02:56.490> i<00:02:57.490> would<00:02:58.360> say

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
was your favorite and why i would say

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.780 
was your favorite and why i would say
probably<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.610> chameleon<00:03:01.150> pattern<00:03:01.540> today<00:03:01.870> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
probably the chameleon pattern today and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.210 
probably the chameleon pattern today and
also<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.750> cheetah<00:03:05.560> tomorrow<00:03:06.040> because<00:03:07.000> it's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
also the cheetah tomorrow because it's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.699 
also the cheetah tomorrow because it's
two<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.490> shortest<00:03:09.850> presence<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.709> it's

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
two of the shortest presence and it's

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.430 
two of the shortest presence and it's
what<00:03:11.950> I'm<00:03:12.130> comfortable<00:03:12.640> with<00:03:12.990> what's<00:03:13.990> usually

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
what I'm comfortable with what's usually

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.520 
what I'm comfortable with what's usually
back<00:03:14.920> home<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.280> Asia<00:03:15.459> people<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.570> shorter<00:03:17.170> or

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
back home in Asia people on shorter or

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.780 
back home in Asia people on shorter or
in<00:03:18.040> patterns<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:18.990> my<00:03:19.990> comfort<00:03:20.440> zone<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
in patterns so my comfort zone is on the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.120 
in patterns so my comfort zone is on the
shorter<00:03:22.150> patterns<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:22.900> I've<00:03:23.590> learned<00:03:23.650> to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
shorter patterns but I've learned to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.970 
shorter patterns but I've learned to
adapt<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.850> pull<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.440> longer<00:03:26.770> or

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
adapt and to pull on on the longer or

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.560 
adapt and to pull on on the longer or
your<00:03:27.130> pattern<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.070> guess<00:03:30.340> it's<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:31.420> a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
your pattern so so I guess it's it's a

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.740 
your pattern so so I guess it's it's a
toss<00:03:31.810> but<00:03:32.530> yeah<00:03:32.980> I'm<00:03:33.730> more<00:03:34.120> comfortable<00:03:34.269> on

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
toss but yeah I'm more comfortable on

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.040 
toss but yeah I'm more comfortable on
the<00:03:35.230> chameleon<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.519> cheetah<00:03:36.959> when<00:03:37.959> you

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
the chameleon and the cheetah when you

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.660 
the chameleon and the cheetah when you
were<00:03:38.140> born<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.530> week<00:03:38.769> go<00:03:38.980> did<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.519> have<00:03:39.640> a
