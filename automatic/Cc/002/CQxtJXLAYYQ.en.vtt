00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi guys and compass and welcome another 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.019
 new video as they saw it in the title 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.969
 xv October xbox one plus xbox 360 in one 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.059
 laptop and that's the user that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 I had recently created playbook 4 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 has decided to create something new and I 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.590
 the truth that when I was watching 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 I was fascinated I said father hears 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.250
 this all this and for those who do not 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.949
 understand here you are seeing an image 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.679
 in which I teach them what they have or 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.350
 as you can see on the one hand is a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.390
 xbox 360 and by the side the new other 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.820
 side is a good xbox I think it's something 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.500
 that is pretty good and when 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.790
 consoles you will know they are made 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.309
 questions about the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.500
 retrocompatibility this is the best 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.930
 way of having it I think that currently 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.399
 you still can not acquire how you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 you can buy today in the playbook 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 4 since it is still in fact design in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 the description this video I'm going to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 leave a video in which everything is taught 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 what with drive and everything that has 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
 this expo 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.659
 the truth is that it is super good because 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.400
 I know I was fascinated as I saw them 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.100
 have liked the other video that tells them 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.380
 the playbook 4 the truth this one liked 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.409
 even more it is as if they were some kind of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 playstation 3 playstation 4 in one 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.390
 laptop and 22 inches 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.909
 It should be noted that it is a pretty 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.040
 big is a beast is something pretty 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.720
 giant and the truth that I think it 's something 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.030
 that is super good and look at me the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 ramp cast me here but if it's something that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.140
 I was watching and I really wanted to 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.600
 share is because I said hey is that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.039
 this is amazing in fact I do not know how 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 how much will it cost I think the other 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.690
 it was around about 1500 dollars 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.820
 but if you carry the console you left 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.340
 like in 1100 dollars it was something like that for the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.500
 style but it 's supposed to be a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 little more expensive since the process is a 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.670
 little bit harder since in the other only 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 a playstation 4 was assembled but in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.990
 this one has to be assembled an xbox one 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.530
 while at the same time you have 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.789
 that to assemble an xbox 360 I do not think 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.340
 that work is a little more saving 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.619
 tube since there are many other things too 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.369
 I just saw that if you turn on the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.200
 Xbox 360 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.940
 and then wants to release the xbox one 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.769
 or inversely that you turn on one and 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.250
 you want to light the other one is not going to be able 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.610
 since this console when you have a 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.440
 charge or is giving voltage to a console 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.450
 the regulator will only respond to a 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.329
 it's not a good thing that he does not go 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.319
 be any on anything or 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.510
 overheating in fact also in 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.370
 the in the video if they get into the channel of 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.099
 user who is creating all of these 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.019
 wonderful technological things are going to 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.610
 be able to appreciate that you have a video of 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.890
 how does the truth is something that is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.599
 super good and I saw it until the end in 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.069
 where we are there I leave you so that 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.260
 check this you tell me how much 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.359
 They think it's going to cost me how I am 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.220
 seeing this I think about 1800 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.629
 dollars then to you the truth that is 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.260
 exaggerated the price the truth that the one 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.489
 he pays he would be something that I know something crazy 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.040
 something I do not know to see is a great 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.450
 fan of these consoles and all because 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.549
 the truth I am sorry exaggeratedly 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.349
 expensive in fact it would be easier for me 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.629
 which I gather something of a 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.900
 transformer anything and have my 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.580
 small intel and bring my console not 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.290
 It would be easier if 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.210
 it will be something like that but anyway 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.740
 Chavos is a very crazy video that 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.510
 I wanted to bring and you know how to see 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.130
 seen the console so do not forget 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.630
 leave your like favorites subscribe to 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.550
 this channel I know that they are subscribed in the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.260
 description I will leave my twitter for 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.030
 that they follow me and I will also leave them 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.440
 my secondary channel in which I am 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.630
 going up variety games like 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.950
 minecraft and other games plus all 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.540
 days and you tell me what is your 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.010
 opinion on all this if you 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.890
 they would buy some of these 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.660
 consoles and what is your opinion I saw in 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.600
 an earlier video that some had 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.480
 said the subscribers that I do not know something 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.160
 of good xbox of sony and microsoft that 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.650
 they could put demand but imagine that 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.320
 that does not even buy this project and 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.900
 it will apply and will cost about who I 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.740
 if the playstation 4 costs about 7 thousand 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.620
 weights about $ 600 dollars what do I know 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.880
 I would cost you a thousand and the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.650
 true that it would be pretty good not 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.900
 it would be with a kind of new playstation 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.340
 laptop that would fit pretty well 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.470
 in case you do it microsoft from 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.180
 you transformed and I told them my opinion 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.850
 forget to leave your like and without more than 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.850
 say goodbye goodbye
