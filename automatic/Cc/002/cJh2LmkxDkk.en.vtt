00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 again it's a little bit 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.189
 more difficult topic but i think so 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.719
 just have to say because there are three 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.320
 good reasons why not be vegan 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.059
 to fit on so point one has 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.470
 just the deep edges and hate 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.560
 on yourself so a bit 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.279
 I do not really like you one 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.570
 one does not resist and 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.429
 smallest still just like often times 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.910
 Can that be good for yours? 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.840
 you all know if you get sick more often 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.309
 I did not always have to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.350
 may be home I no longer constantly 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.149
 somehow also let work be good 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.270
 reason for it somehow and also today 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.420
 easy bad and I mean the car 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440
 So I mean I was like nutrition 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.760
 so bohn has 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 and if I mean one to him 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.300
 luxury sled selection because the pact yes 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.620
 also kind of cheap gasoline or something 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 some meals or so happy but at 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 the neo-Nazi in the car then always that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.680
 Cheapest eating son has already played 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.770
 usually yes at the second in serious 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.380
 reason is just right 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.680
 Great is there you have one you just have 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.020
 animals really doll so yes it is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.630
 meant people like the bride 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.189
 panettiere in would also be general 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 just become bitter more so 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.689
 humans but animals because there but one 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.759
 except somehow our pets or 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.590
 so who somehow always there 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.020
 have a lot to do if you have to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.570
 somewhere a cat can or something and that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.729
 whole group turn and in 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.920
 with played as sony brings the same 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:42.320
 even more than 1000 animals not no 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.010
 human a human is something better 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.750
 here and here 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.540
 I do not want to have to do so 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.030
 should be the third and probably the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.750
 worst reason is that some people 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.340
 well as long as no love evolves to 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.470
 fixed order they bayer of myself 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.950
 decide for your life 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.770
 and you can tell by that if so 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.810
 what is said like here but one 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.289
 Termination does not change anything and whether I am now 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.980
 and either but is way too much 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.380
 work and I do not know or 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.910
 The best is actually so it will be like that 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.610
 bad for he determines that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.870
 since six have already gone or you have 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.760
 will not be true but allowed 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.880
 or now happen seriously it 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.930
 There are one or two really good ones 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.000
 I really did not learn why 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.400
 that's not really serious because 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.130
 meant why he was not known 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.250
 So should you learn a special 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.040
 lives then there is only fish from the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.280
 slate pcs the modern finally fell from 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.310
 of of greenery and so it 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.160
 So only grows hard as it not he 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.560
 is not nothing going to rÃ¼ckflug 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.329
 It's really well-intentioned at last though 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.209
 at least a little 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.120
 or if you are the one part 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.120
 ancestors high in the andes mouth or 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.560
 in general weeks on a mountain 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.030
 certain level just becomes difficult 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.980
 with something edible except even animals so 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.079
 I mean even in any case 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.739
 Germany have been there for a while 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.720
 affected 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.170
 when you see that, so I mean 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.209
 many are not vegan 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:31.340
 these are already 90 percent so 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:33.739
 harmless yes happens and it does me 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.220
 really sorry but it does not work otherwise 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.549
 his 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.090
 Of course you have something so seriously meant 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.980
 Video 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.150
 I hope it has something for you and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.100
 you think it's funny 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.739
 get along a bit 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.400
 mainz the founders with it rausreden or 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.169
 a bit ironic 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.880
 I'll just come back next time 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.079
 A Jew can subscribe with 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.079
