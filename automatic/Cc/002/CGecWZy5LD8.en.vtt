00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
that we want to take about a half an

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.930 
that we want to take about a half an
inch<00:00:39.300> dimension<00:00:40.050> off<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:41.790> want

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
inch dimension off that so we would want

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
inch dimension off that so we would want
to<00:00:42.090> shade<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> case<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> 34<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
half inches wide what that allows us to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.190 
half inches wide what that allows us to
do<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:48.210> least<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.660> quarter<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> an

over the surface of your window and in
that<00:01:02.520> case<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.480> want<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.470> want

that case what we want to do is we want

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.109 
that case what we want to do is we want
to<00:01:05.010> measure<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.090> 35<00:01:06.659> int<00:01:06.960> inch<00:01:07.290> width<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
to measure that 35 int inch width and

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.450 
to measure that 35 int inch width and
add<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.780> least<00:01:09.830> an<00:01:10.830> inch<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.549> two<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:12.420> each<00:01:12.600> side

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
add at least an inch or two to each side

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.370 
add at least an inch or two to each side
depending<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> type<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.450> shade<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
depending on the type of the shade that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770 
depending on the type of the shade that
you<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> last<00:01:18.360> part

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you want to get and then the last part

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.160 
you want to get and then the last part
would<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.979> measure<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.430> length<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> if

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
would be to measure the length so if

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
would be to measure the length so if
it's<00:01:22.380> an<00:01:22.500> inside<00:01:22.890> shade<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.570> want<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's an inside shade we would want to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's an inside shade we would want to
measure<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> sill<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.060> window<00:01:27.479> up

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
measure from the sill of the window up

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.749 
measure from the sill of the window up
to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> top<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.890> opening<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.460> would<00:01:29.640> be

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to the top of the opening which would be

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.020 
to the top of the opening which would be
70<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> half<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.369> case<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
70 and a half and in this case on the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.780 
70 and a half and in this case on the
shade<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> length<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.100> shade<00:01:35.400> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
want it to be just a little bit longer

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.910 
want it to be just a little bit longer
so<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.250> want<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.520> least<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:39.060> 72-inch<00:01:39.780> shade<00:01:40.380> if

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.249 
when you draw that shade all the way
down<00:01:49.740> you've<00:01:50.040> got<00:01:50.250> enough<00:01:50.520> travel<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:52.020> cover

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
down you've got enough travel to cover

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.010 
down you've got enough travel to cover
that<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> outside<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.930> the

this case and you'd want to be pulling
it<00:02:02.159> down<00:02:02.369> maybe<00:02:02.759> even<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.329> way<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> the

floor for decorative purposes or maybe

just<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.600> couple<00:02:06.780> inches<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.489> measure

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
just a couple inches so you can measure

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.369 
just a couple inches so you can measure
the<00:02:08.940> distance<00:02:09.330> from<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.599> floor<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.200> in

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the distance from the floor which in

the distance from the floor which in
this<00:02:10.530> case<00:02:10.590> would<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.310> 11<00:02:11.849> inches<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.349> can

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
this case would be 11 inches so we can

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.970 
this case would be 11 inches so we can
add

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
add

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.979
