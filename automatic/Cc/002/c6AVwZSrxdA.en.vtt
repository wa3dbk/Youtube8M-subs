three stages of the game and it's

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.270 
three stages of the game and it's
letting<00:02:29.510> me<00:02:29.630> load<00:02:29.900> from<00:02:30.170> those<00:02:30.350> stages<00:02:30.650> why

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
letting me load from those stages why

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.310
