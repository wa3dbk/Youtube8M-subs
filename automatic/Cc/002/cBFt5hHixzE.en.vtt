course<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.230> loosen<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.800> use<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> little

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
course I can loosen it and use a little

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
course I can loosen it and use a little
bit<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> oil<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.850> fix<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.359> that's<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> big

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
bit of oil to fix that that's not a big

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.179 
bit of oil to fix that that's not a big
deal<00:00:23.750> that's<00:00:24.750> next<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.199> impossible<00:00:25.230> flick<00:00:26.039> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
open but otherwise everything is pretty

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.040 
open but otherwise everything is pretty
good<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.610> finish<00:00:32.730> everything<00:00:33.270> looks<00:00:33.690> great

came in a holster which i found was
rather<00:00:50.430> odd<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.930> was<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.199> inside<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.920> box

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
rather odd and it was all inside the box

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.139 
rather odd and it was all inside the box
that<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> came<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:55.730> who<00:00:56.730> knows<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:59.149> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that it came with who knows but the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
that it came with who knows but the
quality<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.809> knife<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.590> quite

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.390 
quality of this knife is actually quite
subpar<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> particular<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.400> some

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
subpar for this particular one for some

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
subpar for this particular one for some
odd<00:01:05.549> reason<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> scratches<00:01:06.869> on

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
odd reason you can see the scratches on

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.390 
odd reason you can see the scratches on
it<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> blade<00:01:09.960> itself<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> bit<00:01:10.799> dirtied<00:01:11.280> up

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

it the blade itself is a bit dirtied up
it's<00:01:12.090> almost<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.479> if<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.780> been<00:01:12.930> used<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it's almost as if it's been used a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.859 
it's almost as if it's been used a
little<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:16.220> still<00:01:17.220> sharp<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.420> no<00:01:18.600> real

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
little I still sharp I have no real

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.740 
little I still sharp I have no real
complaints<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:21.439> but<00:01:23.150> yeah<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.360> don't<00:01:24.689> know

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
complaints on that but yeah I don't know

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
complaints on that but yeah I don't know
that's<00:01:25.049> weird<00:01:25.340> but<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.549> open<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.090> all

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that's weird but when you open it up all

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.060 
that's weird but when you open it up all
the<00:01:27.360> way<00:01:31.130> try<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> focus<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:35.040> can

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the way try to focus it here as you can

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.569 
the way try to focus it here as you can
see<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.650> recessed<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.310> little

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
see that is actually recessed a little

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.859 
see that is actually recessed a little
bit<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.119> release<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> blade<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
bit the release for the blade so you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990 
bit the release for the blade so you
really<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.829> push<00:01:44.070> him<00:01:44.340> hard<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.729> your

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
really have to push him hard with your

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.160 
really have to push him hard with your
thumb<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.240> order<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> fold<00:01:46.680> back<00:01:46.920> up

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
thumb in order to get it to fold back up

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.100 
thumb in order to get it to fold back up
that's<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.409> frustrating<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.220> annoying
