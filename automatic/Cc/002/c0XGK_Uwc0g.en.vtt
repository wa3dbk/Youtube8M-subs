00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
the south part matter of fact the two

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.249 
the south part matter of fact the two
crews<00:01:48.710> are<00:01:49.039> quite<00:01:49.490> different<00:01:49.880> but<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.170> a

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
crews are quite different but in a

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.109 
crews are quite different but in a
certain<00:01:51.470> way<00:01:51.649> they're<00:01:52.039> very<00:01:52.490> similar<00:01:52.700> because

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
certain way they're very similar because

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.590 
certain way they're very similar because
they<00:01:53.420> brought<00:01:53.630> very<00:01:53.930> traditional<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:54.860> the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
they brought very traditional and the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.719 
they brought very traditional and the
acidity<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.170> sweet<00:01:57.500> tannins<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:58.430> the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
acidity the sweet tannins is the

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.960 
acidity the sweet tannins is the
characteristic<00:01:59.510> of<00:01:59.689> those<00:02:00.080> two<00:02:00.409> wines<00:02:00.729> LTC<00:02:01.729> no

characteristic of those two wines LTC no

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.810 
characteristic of those two wines LTC no
wine<00:02:02.210> probably<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.200> more<00:02:03.530> masculine<00:02:04.220> because

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
wine probably is more masculine because

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.109 
wine probably is more masculine because
it<00:02:05.090> grows<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.170> north<00:02:06.320> side<00:02:07.040> get<00:02:07.670> strong

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
it grows on the north side get strong

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.720 
it grows on the north side get strong
perfumes<00:02:09.429> maybe<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.790> gets<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.630> colder<00:02:12.290> weather

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
perfumes maybe it gets a colder weather

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.440 
perfumes maybe it gets a colder weather
because<00:02:13.730> less<00:02:14.060> hours<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.959> Sun<00:02:15.790> Capital<00:02:16.790> wine

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
because less hours of Sun Capital wine

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.039 
because less hours of Sun Capital wine
is<00:02:17.720> maybe<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.739> girl<00:02:18.950> it's<00:02:19.850> more<00:02:20.329> feminine

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
is maybe is the girl it's more feminine

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.860 
is maybe is the girl it's more feminine
