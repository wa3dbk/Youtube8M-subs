the Lego white clone this one so you can
see<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:36.820> only<00:03:36.970> differences<00:03:37.570> are<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
group grey lines in there and then this

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.590 
group grey lines in there and then this
one<00:03:44.620> there<00:03:44.800> on<00:03:44.920> grey<00:03:45.190> line<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:46.390> know<00:03:46.510> you

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600
