the Canon protein here to demonstrate it
for<00:00:12.840> me<00:00:13.050> so<00:00:13.620> chain<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:14.130> makes<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.880> 650d

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
for me so chain what makes the 650d

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.570 
for me so chain what makes the 650d
different<00:00:15.930> from<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.170> 600<00:00:16.650> e<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.460> big

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
different from the 600 e the big

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
different from the 600 e the big
standard<00:00:17.910> difference<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.449> 650d<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.050> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and I don't need to that because I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.830 
and I don't need to that because I
thought<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.850> might<00:01:47.940> be<00:01:48.150> not<00:01:48.330> hammer<00:01:48.660> into

you've<00:02:06.630> got<00:02:06.810> two<00:02:07.350> new<00:02:07.470> features<00:02:07.619> they've<00:02:08.490> got

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you've got two new features they've got

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.940 
you've got two new features they've got
HD<00:02:09.119> or<00:02:09.240> backlight<00:02:09.660> which<00:02:10.440> essentially<00:02:10.830> means

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
HD or backlight which essentially means

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.370 
HD or backlight which essentially means
that<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.820> backlit<00:02:12.150> subject<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that if you have a backlit subject it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.110 
that if you have a backlit subject it
learn<00:02:13.560> how<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.800> use<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.100> flash<00:02:14.310> actually<00:02:15.000> use

we have digit y plus in the piper
mercury<00:02:43.870> into<00:02:44.290> one<00:02:44.320> DX<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> first<00:02:45.400> that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
mercury into one DX it's the first that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.750 
mercury into one DX it's the first that
you<00:02:45.640> fight<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.330> u.s.<00:02:46.480> range<00:02:46.750> mid<00:02:47.050> range

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
you fight we in the u.s. range mid range

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.550 
you fight we in the u.s. range mid range
yep<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.030> go<00:02:49.510> back<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.900> hybrid<00:02:50.260> autofocus

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
yep I go back to the hybrid autofocus

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.120 
yep I go back to the hybrid autofocus
and<00:02:51.330> Nikon<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.690> also<00:02:53.050> got<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.530> enough<00:02:53.740> J<00:02:53.920> 1

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
and Nikon have also got that enough J 1

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.370 
and Nikon have also got that enough J 1
and<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.030> v1<00:02:55.480> but<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.020> guys<00:02:56.140> have

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
and in the v1 but you guys have

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.750 
and in the v1 but you guys have
something<00:02:56.530> different<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.280> think<00:02:57.520> it's<00:02:57.610> on

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
something different the I think it's on

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.490 
something different the I think it's on
sensory<00:02:58.180> or<00:02:58.270> pixels<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.750> explaining<00:02:59.080> bit<00:02:59.230> of

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
sensory or pixels on explaining bit of

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.310 
sensory or pixels on explaining bit of
that<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.340> me<00:03:00.520> yeah<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.240> could<00:03:01.450> go<00:03:01.540> true<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:02.050> our

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
that to me yeah I could go true to our

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.520 
that to me yeah I could go true to our
slideshow<00:03:02.830> oh<00:03:03.070> let's<00:03:03.370> not<00:03:03.430> be<00:03:03.640> about<00:03:04.530> what

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
slideshow oh let's not be about what

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.440 
slideshow oh let's not be about what
hopefully<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.580> means<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:07.030> there's

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
hopefully that means that there's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.000 
hopefully that means that there's
dedicated<00:03:07.690> pixels<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.860> sensor<00:03:09.340> which

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
dedicated pixels on the sensor which

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.940 
dedicated pixels on the sensor which
help<00:03:12.010> detect<00:03:12.340> focus<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:13.180> combining<00:03:13.950> standard

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
help detect focus in combining standard

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.750 
help detect focus in combining standard
contrast<00:03:15.550> AF<00:03:16.440> detection<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.800> also<00:03:18.430> phase

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
contrast AF detection and also phase

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.020 
contrast AF detection and also phase
detection<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:20.170> it's<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.560> more<00:03:20.770> it's<00:03:21.400> quicker

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
detection so it's the more it's quicker

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.170 
detection so it's the more it's quicker
autofocus<00:03:22.630> it<00:03:23.140> isn't<00:03:24.070> necessarily<00:03:24.640> superior

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
autofocus it isn't necessarily superior

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.780 
autofocus it isn't necessarily superior
auto<00:03:25.360> focus<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.870> 600<00:03:26.350> e<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.460> have<00:03:27.760> a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
auto focus to 600 e just that you have a

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.180 
auto focus to 600 e just that you have a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
split second quicker response the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.100 
split second quicker response the
advantage<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:30.640> which<00:03:30.790> are<00:03:31.000> mainly<00:03:31.210> seen<00:03:31.540> are

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
advantage of which are mainly seen are

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.620 
advantage of which are mainly seen are
mostly<00:03:32.470> noticeable<00:03:33.220> when<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.030> go<00:03:34.120> into<00:03:34.240> video

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630

look out for with 650d yeah you also

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.210 
look out for with 650d yeah you also
have<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.440> feature<00:03:41.620> it's<00:03:41.800> come<00:03:41.950> down<00:03:41.980> again

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
have the feature it's come down again

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.360
