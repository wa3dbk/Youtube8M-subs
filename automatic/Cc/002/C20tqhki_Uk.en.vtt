and<00:00:41.510> still<00:00:41.870> get<00:00:42.050> them<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:42.350> go<00:00:43.129> into<00:00:43.280> narcosis

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
and still get them to go into narcosis

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.740 
and still get them to go into narcosis
for<00:00:44.239> a<00:00:44.270> couple<00:00:44.750> seconds<00:00:46.420> sometimes<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.600> get<00:00:47.690> a

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
for a couple seconds sometimes you get a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.779 
for a couple seconds sometimes you get a
fish<00:00:47.989> that's<00:00:48.170> right<00:00:48.440> dead<00:00:48.860> center<00:00:49.280> in<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.489> field

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
fish that's right dead center in a field

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.850 
fish that's right dead center in a field
and<00:00:50.030> it'll<00:00:50.149> knock<00:00:50.420> out<00:00:50.629> for<00:00:50.899> maybe<00:00:51.050> 30<00:00:51.379> seconds

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
and it'll knock out for maybe 30 seconds

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.500 
and it'll knock out for maybe 30 seconds
but<00:00:52.430> most<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.820> time<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.120> put<00:00:53.270> them<00:00:53.360> in

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
but most of the time you put them in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.910 
but most of the time you put them in
here<00:00:53.690> they're<00:00:53.840> ready<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.110> their<00:00:54.620> swimming

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
here they're ready to their swimming

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.200 
here they're ready to their swimming
already<00:00:55.280> by<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.489> time<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:55.789> get<00:00:55.879> them<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
already by the time you get them to the

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.740 
already by the time you get them to the
tank

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
tank

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.819 
tank
it's<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.559> pulse<00:00:58.550> DC<00:00:59.180> current<00:00:59.660> that<00:00:59.930> pulse<00:01:00.320> DC

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
it's a pulse DC current that pulse DC

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.439 
it's a pulse DC current that pulse DC
actually<00:01:01.219> attracts<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.789> fish<00:01:01.820> into<00:01:02.359> the

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
actually attracts the fish into the

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.570 
actually attracts the fish into the
field<00:01:02.690> before<00:01:03.109> they're<00:01:03.289> stunned<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:04.399> then

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
field before they're stunned and then

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.969 
field before they're stunned and then
they're<00:01:04.699> only<00:01:04.820> stunned<00:01:05.239> for<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.840> second<00:01:06.830> or<00:01:06.950> two

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
they're only stunned for a second or two

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.460 
they're only stunned for a second or two
at<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.400> very<00:01:07.610> most<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.840> guys<00:01:09.020> can<00:01:09.260> pick

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
at the very most so the guys can pick

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.770 
at the very most so the guys can pick
them<00:01:09.619> up<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.580> fish<00:01:10.790> will<00:01:10.970> actually<00:01:11.330> sense

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
them up and the fish will actually sense

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.870 
them up and the fish will actually sense
the<00:01:11.869> boat<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.380> coming<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:12.979> they'll<00:01:13.520> still

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
the boat is coming and they'll still

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.070 
the boat is coming and they'll still
swim<00:01:14.150> out<00:01:14.270> in<00:01:14.390> front<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:14.750> boat<00:01:14.869> they'll

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
swim out in front of the boat they'll

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.380 
swim out in front of the boat they'll
swim<00:01:15.350> away<00:01:15.500> from<00:01:15.619> us<00:01:15.920> as<00:01:16.100> well<00:01:16.310> fish<00:01:17.030> will<00:01:17.270> be

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
swim away from us as well fish will be

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.109 
swim away from us as well fish will be
measured<00:01:17.750> tagged<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.530> released<00:01:18.939> some<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:19.970> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
measured tagged and released some of the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.109 
measured tagged and released some of the
walleye<00:01:20.390> will<00:01:20.990> be<00:01:21.110> weighed<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.560> aged<00:01:22.400> as<00:01:22.820> well

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
walleye will be weighed and aged as well

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.420 
walleye will be weighed and aged as well
this<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:23.990> fish<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.380> we've<00:01:24.500> we've<00:01:25.070> caught

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
this is a fish that we've we've caught

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.820 
this is a fish that we've we've caught
previously<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.049> we'll<00:01:27.170> get<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.409> number<00:01:27.680> off

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
previously so we'll get the number off

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.109 
previously so we'll get the number off
here<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.009> was<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.220> fish<00:01:31.490> from<00:01:31.670> two<00:01:31.909> years

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
here and this was a fish from two years

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.200 
here and this was a fish from two years
ago<00:01:32.890> it's<00:01:33.890> important<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.759> data<00:01:34.970> we

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
ago it's important that the data we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.050 
ago it's important that the data we
gather<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.689> correct<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:37.040> Ron<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.640> his<00:01:37.759> team

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
gather is correct so Ron and his team

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.330 
gather is correct so Ron and his team
are<00:01:38.329> conducting<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.960> study<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.530> verify<00:01:40.070> that

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
are conducting a study to verify that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.429 
are conducting a study to verify that
the<00:01:40.759> techniques<00:01:41.240> they're<00:01:41.450> using<00:01:41.479> for<00:01:41.869> aging

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
the techniques they're using for aging

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.700 
the techniques they're using for aging
fish<00:01:42.650> give<00:01:43.280> them<00:01:43.460> accurate<00:01:44.270> numbers<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:45.560> do

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
fish give them accurate numbers to do

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.609 
fish give them accurate numbers to do
that<00:01:46.009> they'll<00:01:46.880> use<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.329> spines<00:01:47.869> from<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
that they'll use the spines from the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.819 
that they'll use the spines from the
fish's<00:01:48.950> dorsal<00:01:49.430> fin<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.850> bones<00:01:50.750> inside<00:01:51.590> the

that we tagged when that under first
spawning<00:01:57.140> run<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.619> they're<00:01:57.799> like<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> 14<00:01:58.460> inches

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
old the fish really is but we didn't

know if they were accurate or not

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.530

they're<00:02:23.900> also<00:02:24.230> have<00:02:25.060> odorless<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.240> their<00:02:26.360> head

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540

marks<00:02:37.580> we<00:02:37.700> can<00:02:37.850> count<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:38.840> found<00:02:38.990> out

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
marks we can count and what we found out

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.290 
marks we can count and what we found out
is<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:39.830> were<00:02:39.980> very<00:02:40.040> significantly<00:02:40.970> under

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
is that we were very significantly under

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.230 
is that we were very significantly under
