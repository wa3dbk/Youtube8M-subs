so<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.320> got<00:00:10.320> together<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.769> fire<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.519> would<00:00:11.610> work

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
so I got together a fire that would work

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.490 
so I got together a fire that would work
and<00:00:12.990> we're<00:00:13.679> going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> use<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:15.870> cotton<00:00:16.139> balls

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500

in Vaseline see how they do with this
wet<00:00:19.380> wood<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.570> we'll<00:00:21.570> cook<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.020> fish<00:00:22.230> later

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

something<00:00:23.279> quick<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> trail<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.990> then

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
something quick on the trail and then

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
something quick on the trail and then
make<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> base<00:00:29.720> some<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> little<00:00:32.270> wet

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
make a base some of that is a little wet

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.130 
make a base some of that is a little wet
but<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> make<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> base<00:00:34.410> where<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
but you want to make a base where you

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.889 
but you want to make a base where you
have<00:00:37.140> airflow<00:00:37.770> underneath<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> something

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
have airflow underneath so something

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.369 
have airflow underneath so something
like<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.260> crisscross<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.219> work<00:00:42.379> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
like this crisscross and would work and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.310 
like this crisscross and would work and
I'll<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:44.600> one<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> these<00:00:45.809> cotton<00:00:48.320> pieces

it awhile okay I just flip them put new
moss<00:04:44.910> on<00:04:46.280> but<00:04:47.280> they're<00:04:47.430> cooking<00:04:47.789> pretty<00:04:47.970> good

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
moss on but they're cooking pretty good

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.500 
moss on but they're cooking pretty good
as<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:50.700> can<00:04:50.910> see<00:04:52.370> not<00:04:53.370> doing<00:04:53.729> too<00:04:53.880> bad

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
as you can see not doing too bad

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.020 
as you can see not doing too bad
so<00:04:54.949> this<00:04:55.949> moss<00:04:56.220> is<00:04:56.460> keeping<00:04:56.760> them<00:04:56.850> from

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
so this moss is keeping them from

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.210 
so this moss is keeping them from
burning<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:57.900> don't<00:04:57.960> put<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.620> lot<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.979> fire

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
burning and I don't put a lot of fire

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.070 
burning and I don't put a lot of fire
down<00:04:59.490> here<00:04:59.520> just<00:04:59.910> have<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.210> hot<00:05:00.360> coals

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
down here just have the hot coals

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.670 
down here just have the hot coals
not<00:05:02.039> a<00:05:02.070> little<00:05:02.250> bit<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.520> wood<00:05:02.669> we<00:05:02.820> had<00:05:03.680> there's

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
not a little bit of wood we had there's

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.760 
not a little bit of wood we had there's
how<00:05:04.889> much<00:05:05.070> steam<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.669> lets<00:05:05.880> off<00:05:06.620> when<00:05:07.620> you

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
how much steam it lets off when you

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.820 
how much steam it lets off when you
start<00:05:08.070> cooking<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:09.320> think<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:10.500> pretty
