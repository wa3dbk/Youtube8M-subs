currently a year and ten months she

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.819 
currently a year and ten months she
would<00:00:24.970> have<00:00:25.059> been<00:00:25.210> a<00:00:25.360> Habitrail<00:00:25.930> cage<00:00:26.290> that

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
would have been a Habitrail cage that

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.179 
would have been a Habitrail cage that
was<00:00:27.070> really<00:00:27.550> small<00:00:28.029> and<00:00:28.390> had<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.380> lot<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:30.009> tubes

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
was really small and had a lot of tubes

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.729 
was really small and had a lot of tubes
but<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:31.450> she<00:00:31.599> was<00:00:31.779> really<00:00:32.050> shy<00:00:32.290> so<00:00:32.559> it<00:00:32.619> was

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
but and she was really shy so it was

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.470 
but and she was really shy so it was
really<00:00:32.920> hard<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.190> get<00:00:33.340> her<00:00:33.460> out<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:34.300> was

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
really hard to get her out and I was

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.079 
really hard to get her out and I was
doing<00:00:34.690> research<00:00:35.079> on<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.350> computer<00:00:35.649> and<00:00:36.399> found

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
doing research on the computer and found

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.489 
doing research on the computer and found
out<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:37.839> was<00:00:38.019> not<00:00:38.050> safe<00:00:38.559> like<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:41.230> was

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:41.499 
out that it was not safe like and it was

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.869 
out that it was not safe like and it was
really<00:00:41.679> crowded<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:43.300> some<00:00:43.839> toys<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:45.219> I

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
really crowded with some toys and I

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.000 
really crowded with some toys and I
upgraded<00:00:46.420> her<00:00:47.339> to<00:00:48.339> a<00:00:48.789> cage<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:50.469> a<00:00:50.499> big<00:00:50.739> cage

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
upgraded her to a cage to a big cage

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
upgraded her to a cage to a big cage
that<00:00:51.909> made<00:00:53.999> so<00:00:54.999> it<00:00:55.300> was<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.980> first<00:00:57.190> place<00:00:57.460> was

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that made so it was the first place was

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.450 
that made so it was the first place was
432<00:01:01.949> she<00:01:02.949> liked<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.940> then<00:01:04.950> last<00:01:05.950> month

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
432 she liked that and then last month

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.150 
432 she liked that and then last month
I'm<00:01:06.940> pretty<00:01:07.150> sure<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.690> upgraded<00:01:08.620> her<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.280> a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
I'm pretty sure I upgraded her to a

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.780 
I'm pretty sure I upgraded her to a
query<00:01:12.160> homepage<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:13.410> it's<00:01:14.410> doubles<00:01:15.040> for<00:01:15.760> a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
query homepage and it's doubles for a

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.740 
query homepage and it's doubles for a
space<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:17.010> 840<00:01:18.720> square<00:01:19.720> inches<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.750> she

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
space so it's 840 square inches and she

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.280 
space so it's 840 square inches and she
really<00:01:23.020> likes<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.970> four<00:01:25.420> feet<00:01:25.630> long<00:01:25.960> and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
really likes it it's four feet long and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.180 
really likes it it's four feet long and
one<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.920> half<00:01:26.950> feet<00:01:27.670> wide<00:01:28.890> she<00:01:29.890> really

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
one and a half feet wide she really

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.600 
one and a half feet wide she really
likes<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.440> she's<00:01:32.440> becoming<00:01:33.220> more<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.550> a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
likes it and she's becoming more of a

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.850 
likes it and she's becoming more of a
hamster<00:01:34.060> she<00:01:34.450> runs<00:01:34.840> around<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.410> she<00:01:35.560> starts

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
hamster she runs around and she starts

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.130 
hamster she runs around and she starts
to<00:01:36.010> burrow<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:37.800> she's<00:01:38.800> um<00:01:39.930> chewing<00:01:40.930> more

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
to burrow and she's um chewing more

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.780 
to burrow and she's um chewing more
because<00:01:41.770> she<00:01:41.920> feels<00:01:42.160> more<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.550> hamster

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
because she feels more like a hamster

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.610 
because she feels more like a hamster
the<00:01:43.180> bigger<00:01:43.330> force<00:01:43.690> base<00:01:44.400> and<00:01:45.400> yeah

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
the bigger force base and yeah

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.750 
the bigger force base and yeah
