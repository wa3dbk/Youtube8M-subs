00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.810
 do not 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.630
 hi friends from youtube I am a keyboard player 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.630
 thank you very much for visiting my channel 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.940
 today we are going to prepare that 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.100
 Equipe is a typical dish of the kitchen 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.380
 Lebanese and consists only of meat 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.279
 milled wheat and some seasonings I know 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 that is a dish that you will like 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 much 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.940
 there are two variants in which is the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.650
 type nobody who escapes raw and also the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 type of fried can also be baked 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.550
 or as you want to prepare it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.400
 we only need two ground beef 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.660
 times and with zero percentage of fat 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.420
 we also need Arabian pepper salt 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.580
 water with ice and ground wheat I have 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.380
 number 1 we leave the wheat soaking 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.320
 plentiful water for 5 minutes 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.140
 approximately then we put it well and 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.940
 we reserve it and the water with ice is 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.710
 to keep the meat fresh too 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.800
 so we can move forward 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.140
 more easily we begin by adding 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.210
 the meat in a blender if they do not have 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.280
 a blender can be Roman is a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.710
 little more tedious and complicated but the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.690
 result is the same place mixer 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.760
 fast speed and we start placing 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.470
 the letter to we passed very well the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.440
 consistency of the meat has to be 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.119
 a little elastic note that with the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.000
 blender we are crushing the meat 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.340
 against the wall of it this for 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.170
 make it work easier 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.399
 at this point we can add 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.399
 Slowly ice cubes 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:44.980
 if we add it and we will knead it not for 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.980
 and never knead is very important 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 After a while we can add the algae 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.689
 the proportion of salt will be in accordance 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.270
 to your liking at the end of the mix you 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.159
 They have to try and see if they lack salt 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 adding salt is that he needs to paint 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.079
 add pepper we also add a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.079
 little water 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.910
 Every so often it's good to check with 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 a fork how is the consistency of 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.019
 the meat look here like the same 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.550
 good coach soft coach is missing 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.030
 a little bit is that it's still a bit 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.030
 scattered 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.200
 we continue beating we are adding 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.260
 little by little the water the ice the salt the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.260
 Pepper 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.939
 we started adding wheat the 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.980
 correct proportion for this 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.930
 preparation is now every kilo of 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.299
 meat in half a kilo of wheat also 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.760
 you can use less depending on how you 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.790
 go to use for raw meat is used 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.739
 little wheat for the meat cooked by the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.450
 cooked stipe expedited baked like 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.640
 you want to prepare you have to 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.859
 look for the wheat a lot after this 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.689
 We put him to feed the first one 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.879
 we toss the salt then I tell you and now what 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.799
 feed the pepper will make the most 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.470
 that certain fish is a preparation that 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:06.189
 as well as sell made in the in 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.189
 food places with 2 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.870
 and we keep beating and we're going to see the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.870
 consistency of the meat 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.050
 or I saw myself on the ground 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.700
 we remove the meat with the fork and 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.850
 we can see that it is already more compact than 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.790
 the previous one you see the wheat and from 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.340
 this point we can already prove it 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.069
 we finished tying the pp and you 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.109
 we add olive oil on top too 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.400
 we can decorate it with a mint 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.400
 very tasty with raw onion 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.569
 if the cooked pressures there are several 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.720
 ways of doing it can be first 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.970
 baked can be fried can be to the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.830
 grilled plate and in this case 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.750
 We will use a pan with oil 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.880
 olive heat the pan well and 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.000
 we add olive oil we prepare 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.640
 apart a kind of meatball or 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.230
 hamburger with the meat and we're going to 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.240
 add the we will place on the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.970
 oil 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.260
 think that it 's okay the idea is to form 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.150
 an inner crust and feel that 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.420
 the fire is too high can lower it 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.420
 medium 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.550
 After a while we turned the meat and the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.740
 we knew on the other hand 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.729
 notice the purchase that was formed in a 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.729
 side of the letter also crispy 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.800
 what remains is to serve the time they can 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.469
 eat them raw or cooked depends on the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.479
 I prefer it cooked and raw 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.460
 also very tasty try both and 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.809
