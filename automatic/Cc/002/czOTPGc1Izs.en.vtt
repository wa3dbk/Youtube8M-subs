00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.060
 and how very good everything wants to go up 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.850
 commenting on a new video and in the video 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.410
 today we go back to the series of addons and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.110
 of tricks that had been a while since 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.340
 we were going back and we are going to show you an add-on 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.200
 and for a particular case the truth 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 is that it is an airplane that surrounds you in 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.720
 many things but that above all we are going 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.230
 to give a point one more point of control 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.200
 on the subject this to gift 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.809
 is for wii what will modify us 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.149
 it's going to be the whole subject of our bars 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.910
 of life the icons as we see people 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.550
 of the cetera the add-on has left 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.960
 web and unit frames valero see in between 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.660
 and you're going to see the one down here well in 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.660
 We are not really going to focus much on 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.680
 how can you put the life bars on 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.150
 subject of percentage how wide what 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.759
 you can move from one place to another 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.060
 etcetera etcetera but in something very 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:18.930
 special that has the same way 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 that on one's wish 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 wow we can see when we ourselves 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 with an incognito like here by hand 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.610
 left we are or we are not in 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.320
 fight this this to don the show 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 tribune and frames that you are going to see a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.930
 little bit how it works now that is pulled out 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.780
 with the south bar command 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 It's worth as it sounds good and good, well, you go 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.610
 to see that he has lots of options 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 I'm going to comment on all this is a 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.430
 madness if I can not comment the all 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.930
 we can throw ourselves here years and only 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.479
 I want to talk about one thing in particular 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.020
 It's worth it if you need help with your own 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.479
 don melo is something that we are going to comment and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 I already focus that I am diversifying 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.250
 it's about when our target or 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.429
 our focus is or is not in combat 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.229
 in this really right now there is no 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.300
 many addons that know how to treat well 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.250
 I tried to mount a macro with the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.140
 power auras and it has been completely 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.750
 impossible I arrived took all afternoon 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.970
 trying and did not come way we were 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.090
 in the forum 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.260
 a discussion about how to do it 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.960
 because there is a video of an uncle that has 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 some super big icons but I think 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.500
 that he has done it through some kind 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.720
 of script or something specific to 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.230
 arenas in this case this to where we 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.860
 works for all moments well and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.440
 It's as easy as going unit by unit 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.660
 player if we record other targets if 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.450
 we want in our goal and the focus 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.360
 if we want the focus we go through 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.660
 indicators by combat indicators 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.880
 status 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.820
 in April indicates but that is to say what 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.450
 activated comment that the size that 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.700
 it comes by default it 's very small well what 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.780
 normal is that this size does not come out here 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.460
 is more than just in x and in and it's worth 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:17.030
 activate the average size to activate the 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.630
 size we are going to 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.630
 sorry 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.040
 in general and we apply advanced that 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.160
 you see that if I remove it now I'm going to 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.490
 target no longer comes out but if I return it to 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.490
 Apply 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.000
 and so it works out ok for you to see a 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.310
 example returned yesterday to a blooming and 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.500
 Then he will tell me 9 g so you can see how 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.269
 brand or as it does not brand and how useful we 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.750
 is going to be when it comes to making a sab 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.030
 after we make a line or after 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.190
 we do anything else we 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.650
 Let's do it in a boom 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.689
 and first 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.340
 obviously I'm going to do it with the focus 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.489
 guys so you can see me 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.489
 directly 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 let's leave the camera a little bit and 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.980
 you will see that I am here not that if the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.190
 I also focus here in 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.440
 great 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.410
 and you see that the two swords come out 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.330
 pretty big appointments are here 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.620
 obviously if I card today to me 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.019
 as well 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.880
 this will also leave me for what 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.950
 ok then let's make an example 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.450
 well we are already in an old age 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:31.050
 we are in a bar are girls 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.750
 Well let's go to teach 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.430
 senate I'm going to place the first one that 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.920
 I can because I do not know who I'm going to 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.900
 cross in the focus and I will also catch 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.360
 in the workshop and I'm going to put him in if god 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.790
 he wants and they leave me a blind so that 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.830
 see after giving him a pineapple like 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.370
 it goes out and how it gets back into 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.080
 I will try to catch the last 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.080
 Let's see if I have any luck 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.750
 on the hook at the end there I have a what 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.750
 that I have 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.400
 he has provided 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.540
 or it has been disassembled super great not 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.540
 water again 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.270
 I entered a combat you see the icon 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.960
 guys who is in the leads in front of him 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.960
 launched online 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.160
 and you are going to see how to get out in combat and 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.710
 I can take it out you guys have seen it here 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.500
 good guys besides that the add-on in 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.780
 reality is very complete will leave us 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.690
 completely customize our bar 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.250
 of life of our target of 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.530
 our focus as we had seen 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.260
 previously the target of also the 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.420
 target you can make a billion 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.900
 of things could I put myself to explain it 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.440
 but but so you know an idea everything 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.410
 this is for every part and explain this 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.910
