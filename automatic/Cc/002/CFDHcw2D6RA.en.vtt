00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.600
 Hello once 5 of them want and I say today as we are with the trend 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.100
 Money avoids percent that you saw, of course it's worth it 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.949
 to adjust 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:10.999
 June pull 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.200
 3b page 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.499
 nonsense for those coming in it would be quite supportive 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.369
 what so shock and 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.980
 then down 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.779
 here with extensions after click 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.350
 click for cocaine 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.519
 I'm simply rewarded by the genes and happiness seems to be rewarding 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.149
 to talk about things and have taken time 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.149
 Berlin the partial that understates Pop Rakic 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.830
 so far then bet your instruments 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 increase the accredited USD 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.540
 really great 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.540
 then there are too tight sap solutions Schemmer and 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.010
 Year fits more purely formal larger ones like Armand so the length of the map and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.899
 the width 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.110
 and she wants 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.290
 the other is straight and of concern 1 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.350
 Cintas itself as desired 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.400
 With this is usually we do not need there 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 to do something like that yourself 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.980
 closer to Peter Kropp 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.430
 this suits me 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.790
 and then her yard went 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.840
 click on the picture 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.210
 Coach says clicking on components too narrow at the bottom and sang too tight 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820
 then look now 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.920
 there are rich ones 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.570
 3 i 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.109
 over steps so 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.040
 Red 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 Barioz 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.000
 give it its shape and so it is me what 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.730
 so 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.370
 Wegner clarify and there is so their offer 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.200
 so Aßmann have to create water how to go year occurred 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.950
 Weiner hot topics 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.180
 click here 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.049
 at feature that in the middle since we 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.659
 no peaks of the greens 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.060
 no dulls per compartment so determined and then dug at her say 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.190
 no idea what his 20 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.630
 20 count 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.999
 fix it is so north now that sets here 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.999
 Point 7 of mine under our Cham 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.279
 Jena Red 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.129
 Want to promote new features 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.129
 Generate the Reken RPL Bönen markets 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.720
 we still today 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.669
 can also export if necessary 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.479
 then should be called 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.789
 Let's see how it's okay Skibbe open to the dollar 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.039
 she does not go that way 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.389
 Realistic from not who that is is not bad 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.040
 The area just on beads and give the default because the Irish 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:41.399
 So priests have to say that they want to pass their passport 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.969
 the login he slips money 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.930
 we like the attitude for a long time 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.260
 Jena is 19 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.269
 and singing already looks a bit more realistic 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.779
 Yes 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:57.959
 Just leave us like that 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.759
 look around now 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.660
 Piebalgs as it looks like it lacks textures eyes 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 Just leave him Apax then we'll do it 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.109
 four times 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.479
 has the mixing made again so usually so synonymous 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.599
 around 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.069
 then 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.189
 let's just go Euro 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.319
 our textures to be convincing sixth 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.599
 CW alternatively under Langkamp also from official side 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.299
 Accommodations to that is simply the texture up 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.069
 the places indicated is from the mountains 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.569
 around 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.629
 I just sit there and then the APA Klüft because the have 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.919
 I 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.399
 I just ask myself by myself 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.289
 the normal approx 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:44.620
 Kreft Ex Thurk has made black and white it could do too 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.249
 Easy going in texture for you to have an accomplice PP you 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:49.609
 roar 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.249
 before simply adapt to performance 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:53.989
 Just by the way 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.060
 Change Rudi 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.239
 Hotte the simple times in the Rheinische Strokes is not big 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.079
 what is the value of a victory that is here from the bottom up? 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.529
 1 that we should that would then be the bottom of the ground 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.859
 that should be done 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.929
 Sand be out of her 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.220
 2 is so it is the transition 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.739
 that the elections of everything 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.209
 That's why 2 just becomes a Kross Textor 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.449
 terminated 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.090
 Unfortunately, there are slips 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.249
 and at the top 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.249
 that's important to me 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.360
 at the top 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.830
 Counter and snow in over this or 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.289
 the ashes are laying 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.169
 and around 2 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.639
 then that also for the sake of mixed race and so Kenwood praise from post 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.840
 and they see something else 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.879
 Percentage points Cryptic Studios and law firms, on the other hand, less 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.919
 how do I like it whole man I think so too Roth 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.259
 PGO leaks okay almost is fine 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.259
 ours against those with two old specification is long 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.990
 kept the guidelines 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.740
 Percent too 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.740
 the shares of the 20 in our field May 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.910
 and we see the whole Spizig flattened, they are not that way anymore 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.990
 innumerable 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.680
 Then now 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.539
 well we have little snow that's why we went up 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.069
 later everything again 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.949
 and easy 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.949
 Thus, though stuck and normal ice 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.689
 thereupon 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.819
 just the texture 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.240
 and we see a bit more in it 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.560
 then we go back up 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.810
 Notes and 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.810
 The whole thing out again 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 what with the default of 1 percent 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.979
 But that is not her then 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.129
 Year and so made about a reduction and it can happen sometimes something lost 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.539
 Weinheim 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.539
 to the Ankurbler 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.689
 There are parallels and the NATO agency 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.689
 Dr 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.949
 Arndt, of course, no light in inflicted but also sets less 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.889
 important to settlements looks like I hope now it will not be you 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.189
 percent 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.189
 Spacken Plank 10 2 as well as in the Prignitz 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.359
 I'm in Kingston I think I can take it that way 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.139
 Percent yes 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.719
 it was like wrinkles and completely open 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.809
 such and helped this next year at Seher realpolitik
