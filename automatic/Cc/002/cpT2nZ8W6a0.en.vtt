00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.950
 achieve very easily and simply 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.099
 what's called a julienne of vegetables 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.870
 then to know a julienne of vegetables 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.790
 it's a way of pruning vegetables 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.009
 as they say to make a brunoise of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.980
 peppers make an ounce of carrots 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.420
 these are very specific terms so 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 here in this case we will see the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.619
 julienne to make a julienne 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 it's very simple we will take first 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 the poro aquaro wash well or the cut in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.550
 two at first and again one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.059
 time we want you can have 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.680
 your your pork leaves so at 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.129
 parrot leaves you put them to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.230
 dish we strongly support and with 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.469
 your knife is unwinding wine 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:58.170
 is nothing like this you have in this 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:04.129
 case of thin slivers of corals not 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:07.049
 more than 2 mm wide we continue 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.159
 the movements back and forth while 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.080
 protecting your fingers 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.930
 so the position adopted for Vaudois 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.600
 was slightly curved as the knife 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:22.619
 can pass on without cutting you 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.689
 so here we have our julienne of 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.130
 pig we will do the same for the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.290
 pepper since we are going to do the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.200
 pepper so to do that cut you 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.439
 already in two like this is a second 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.380
 time 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.070
 no the other way all these little ones 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.750
 asperity 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.189
 we bother to cut the julienne 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 so with a sole fillet or remove 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.180
 the surplus but especially a gt not you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.880
 keep to make seasonings 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.280
 to make brown background or any 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.689
 just to cut in brunoise so 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.790
 then when you have that part of 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.399
 pepper I threatened again in 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.560
 July ie not more than 2 to 3 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.560
 mm wide 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.840
 like this here 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.810
 and you go to your first 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.020
 pepper label movies you take them back 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.910
 in the other direction once they are 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:30.600
 in it you put aside the flat and / or been 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:35.920
 the operation again like this 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:40.270
 the whole length of the pepper and there you 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.700
 have very thin guts 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.840
 peppers it's called julienne to 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.090
 present i will show you the apple 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.200
 apple so you take an apple the street 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.020
 until now a good 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.270
 Muscovite unpeeled mail have with 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.130
 your son is the only one you prune from 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.970
 abel films about 5 mm thick 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.050
 like these not bigger you in 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.700
 size and two three years we will put the 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.010
 eraser side for the moment so a 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.050
 once you have three slats 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.180
 wanted to have the place well and you 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.410
 take your thinness and there the same 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:22.300
 process you carve very finely your 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:28.200
 palm approximately 5 mm 2 for 2 to 3 mm 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:34.270
 like this over the entire length 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.770
 here and you have your julienne de 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.480
 apples that you can have on a 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.700
 pineapple carpaccio or just 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.330
 on a plate with a little bit of 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.520
 Vinaigrette 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.890
 it's surprising and you can taste 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.130
 it's extremely friendly 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.130
