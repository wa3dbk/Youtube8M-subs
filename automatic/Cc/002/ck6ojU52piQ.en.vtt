okay<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.979> utility<00:00:02.310> Pro<00:00:02.820> it<00:00:03.030> comes

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay this is the utility Pro it comes

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.420 
okay this is the utility Pro it comes
from<00:00:03.570> our<00:00:03.750> Lowe's<00:00:04.220> obviously<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.250> very

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
from our Lowe's obviously a very

from our Lowe's obviously a very
significant<00:00:06.240> retailer<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.690> America

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
significant retailer in America

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.900 
significant retailer in America
um<00:00:07.680> that's<00:00:08.040> primarily<00:00:08.370> why<00:00:08.550> it's<00:00:08.670> interesting

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
um that's primarily why it's interesting

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.020 
um that's primarily why it's interesting
since<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:09.570> sure<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:09.900> wildly<00:00:10.559> available<00:00:11.030> it

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
since I'm sure it's wildly available it

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.600 
since I'm sure it's wildly available it
is<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.269> EF<00:00:12.509> 60<00:00:12.929> white<00:00:13.110> potency<00:00:13.620> dimmable<00:00:14.130> unit

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
is a EF 60 white potency dimmable unit

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.599 
is a EF 60 white potency dimmable unit
it<00:00:15.330> comes<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.680> electric<00:00:17.190> actually

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
it comes from that electric actually

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.220 
it comes from that electric actually
presumably<00:00:18.090> actually<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.480> manufacturer<00:00:19.109> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
presumably actually the manufacturer of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.400 
presumably actually the manufacturer of
it<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:20.279> will<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.699> always<00:00:20.850> analyze<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.109> then

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
it we will as always analyze it and then

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.570 
it we will as always analyze it and then

distribution<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.810> box<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.349> nice<00:00:28.740> in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
distribution the box is actually nice in

distribution the box is actually nice in
this<00:00:29.070> product<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.490> shows<00:00:29.760> there's<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> light

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
this product at shows there's a light

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
this product at shows there's a light

also actually another honest thing to

also actually another honest thing to

emulation of the old HK bulb is actually

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.720 
emulation of the old HK bulb is actually

this<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.440> mostly<00:00:49.739> firing<00:00:50.129> downwards

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this you can see mostly firing downwards

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.119 
this you can see mostly firing downwards
with<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:50.940> too<00:00:51.059> many<00:00:51.120> side<00:00:51.300> lobe<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:52.039> that's<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
with not too many side lobe now that's a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.970 
with not too many side lobe now that's a
problem<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.579> sense<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.120> bill<00:00:54.360> won't

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
problem the sense that this bill won't

problem the sense that this bill won't
fit<00:00:55.980> into<00:00:56.160> every<00:00:56.550> fixture<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.180> emulate<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
ins will do better in some pictures and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
ins will do better in some pictures and

others for example this ball probably

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.969 
others for example this ball probably
would<00:01:03.660> work<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:03.899> well<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.409> lamp<00:01:04.769> like

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
would work really well and a lamp like

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.500 
would work really well and a lamp like
this<00:01:05.159> which<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.430> primarily<00:01:06.390> firing<00:01:07.260> downwards

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510

of<00:01:12.299> low<00:01:12.750> end<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> has<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> sort<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> behavior

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
of low end it has a sort of behavior

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.999 
of low end it has a sort of behavior
just<00:01:14.159> snaps<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:15.140> relatively<00:01:16.140> bright<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.890> then

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
just snaps on relatively bright and then

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.380 
just snaps on relatively bright and then
of<00:01:17.070> course<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.369> dimmable<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.820> some<00:01:18.000> extreme

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
of course it is dimmable to some extreme

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
of course it is dimmable to some extreme
so<00:01:18.770> certainly<00:01:19.770> bulbs<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.670> gotten<00:01:21.030> better

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
so certainly bulbs have gotten better

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
so certainly bulbs have gotten better

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.800 
it
okay<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.760> well<00:01:56.880> certainly<00:01:57.270> make<00:01:57.600> one

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.789 
left I turn down previously under the
FET<00:01:59.700> brand<00:01:59.970> name<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> say<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.350> physical

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
FET brand name I had to say in physical

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
shape
the<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.090> difference<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the one difference is I think that the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.320 
the one difference is I think that the
light<00:02:05.460> pattern<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.940> slightly<00:02:06.150> more

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
light pattern is slightly more

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.850 
light pattern is slightly more
directional<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.140> suspect<00:02:07.530> them<00:02:07.680> through

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
directional so I suspect them through

directional so I suspect them through
the<00:02:07.920> hood<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.300> we'll<00:02:09.300> find<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.600> slightly

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the hood here we'll find a slightly

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780 
the hood here we'll find a slightly

probably<00:02:18.420> why<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.870> getting<00:02:18.989> such<00:02:19.260> a

directional dome light now as I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.090 
directional dome light now as I
mentioned<00:02:22.080> actually<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.350> torn<00:02:22.590> down<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.800> FET

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
mentioned actually it torn down a FET

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.490 
mentioned actually it torn down a FET
light<00:02:23.280> previous<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.959> dome<00:02:28.200> and

light previous to that the dome and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.550 
light previous to that the dome and
there's<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.280> move<00:02:29.940> away<00:02:30.030> from<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:31.380> this

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
there's the move away from that now this

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.870 
there's the move away from that now this
other<00:02:31.830> FET<00:02:32.100> actually<00:02:32.430> had<00:02:32.519> us<00:02:32.610> why<00:02:32.730> he's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
other FET actually had us why he's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.860 
other FET actually had us why he's
better<00:02:33.030> powdered<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> little<00:02:33.720> more

light<00:02:35.550> bulb<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.840> think<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.050> remember<00:02:37.440> it

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
light bulb I just think the remember it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.009 
light bulb I just think the remember it
just<00:02:38.040> packaging<00:02:38.550> saying<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:38.970> was<00:02:39.120> at<00:02:39.660> better

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
just packaging saying that was at better

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.090 
just packaging saying that was at better
light<00:02:40.230> distribution<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.690> see<00:02:42.900> they

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
light distribution so you can see they

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.910 
light distribution so you can see they
made<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> dome<00:02:44.340> larger<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:46.319> there's<00:02:46.769> some

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
made the dome larger and there's some

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.190 
made the dome larger and there's some
subtle<00:02:47.489> changes<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.420> patterns<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.049> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
subtle changes on the patterns of the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.130 
subtle changes on the patterns of the
LEDs<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:51.209> surprisingly<00:02:51.660> crits<00:02:51.959> that's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
LEDs and a surprisingly crits that's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.809 
LEDs and a surprisingly crits that's
really<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.410> even<00:02:52.680> faintly<00:02:52.890> different<00:02:53.310> light

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
really just even faintly different light

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.460 
really just even faintly different light
pattern<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:54.720> you're<00:02:54.810> interested<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.200> under

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
pattern so if you're interested in under

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.170 
pattern so if you're interested in under
the<00:02:55.620> same<00:02:55.830> YouTube<00:02:56.190> channel<00:02:56.519> there's<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> FET

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the same YouTube channel there's a FET

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.630 
the same YouTube channel there's a FET
review<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.110> bulb<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.440> few<00:02:58.560> months<00:02:58.739> ago<00:02:58.830> so

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
review of the bulb a few months ago so

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.150 
review of the bulb a few months ago so
interesting<00:03:00.239> okay<00:03:00.959> let's<00:03:01.440> keep<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.130> going

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
interesting okay let's keep on going

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.150 
interesting okay let's keep on going
through<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.579> think<00:03:02.760> oh<00:03:03.680> okay<00:03:04.680> go<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> bit

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
through the you think oh okay go a bit

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.050 
through the you think oh okay go a bit
further<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.670> can<00:03:05.820> see<00:03:05.910> they've<00:03:06.030> been

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
further now you can see they've been

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.630 
further now you can see they've been
arraigned<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.750> been<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> bonded<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.980> pretty

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
arraigned it's been a bonded to pretty

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.009 
arraigned it's been a bonded to pretty
significant<00:03:09.180> heatsink<00:03:09.480> actually<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.900> can

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
significant heatsink actually you can

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.479 
significant heatsink actually you can
see<00:03:10.170> there's<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.440> considerable<00:03:11.280> amount<00:03:11.459> of

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
see there's a considerable amount of

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.670 
see there's a considerable amount of
surface<00:03:11.700> area<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.329> heatsink<00:03:12.750> which<00:03:13.530> is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
surface area on the heatsink which is

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.110 
surface area on the heatsink which is
good<00:03:13.829> design<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.370> allow<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.609> heat<00:03:14.940> from

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
good design that allow the heat from

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.900 
good design that allow the heat from
these<00:03:15.359> LEDs<00:03:15.750> he's<00:03:16.079> drawn<00:03:16.290> out<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.190> quite

these LEDs he's drawn out and and quite

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.539 
these LEDs he's drawn out and and quite
efficiently<00:03:18.359> just<00:03:18.690> beat<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.200> air

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
efficiently just beat it to the air

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.160

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.390 
controller here electro today she talks
about<00:05:30.810> having<00:05:31.139> integrated<00:05:31.349> MOSFET<00:05:32.010> yet<00:05:32.250> but

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
about having integrated MOSFET yet but

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.330 
about having integrated MOSFET yet but
you<00:05:32.460> can<00:05:32.550> clear<00:05:32.849> see<00:05:33.120> on<00:05:33.300> this<00:05:33.539> design<00:05:34.340> they've

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
you can clear see on this design they've

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.040 
you can clear see on this design they've
had<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.610> do<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.820> little<00:05:36.030> daughter<00:05:36.330> card<00:05:36.690> with

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
had to do a little daughter card with

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.749 
had to do a little daughter card with
what<00:05:37.620> looks<00:05:37.770> like<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.919> MOSFET<00:05:38.310> if<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.580> got<00:05:38.729> a

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
what looks like a MOSFET if you got a

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.890 
what looks like a MOSFET if you got a
part<00:05:39.509> so<00:05:39.870> relatively<00:05:40.770> expensive<00:05:41.039> approach

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
part so relatively expensive approach

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.010 
part so relatively expensive approach

these<00:05:46.110> are<00:05:46.259> free<00:05:46.409> in<00:05:46.560> my<00:05:46.680> protection<00:05:47.070> and

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
these are free in my protection and

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:53.710 
these are free in my protection and
otherwise<00:05:48.599> hopefully<00:05:49.470> have<00:05:49.590> been<00:05:49.680> remarkable

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.089 

okay<00:05:54.720> let's<00:05:55.110> tell<00:05:55.409> you<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.620> score<00:05:55.919> in<00:05:56.009> this

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
okay let's tell you the score in this

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.189 
okay let's tell you the score in this
one<00:05:56.159> light<00:05:57.090> pattern<00:05:57.479> that<00:05:57.659> wasn't<00:05:57.930> very<00:05:58.050> good

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
one light pattern that wasn't very good

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.320 
one light pattern that wasn't very good
it<00:05:58.470> was<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:58.710> actually<00:05:59.550> no<00:05:59.639> accumulation<00:06:00.270> of

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
it was a actually no accumulation of

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.020 
it was a actually no accumulation of
light<00:06:00.509> bulb<00:06:00.750> but<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:02.130> packaging<00:06:02.820> was<00:06:02.880> very

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
light bulb but the packaging was very

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.790 
light bulb but the packaging was very
clear<00:06:03.330> that<00:06:03.449> that<00:06:03.509> was<00:06:03.810> not<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.229> case<00:06:04.349> it<00:06:04.590> was

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
clear that that was not the case it was

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.990 
clear that that was not the case it was
going<00:06:04.979> to<00:06:05.070> be<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.159> directional<00:06:05.580> bulb

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
going to be a directional bulb

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.839 
going to be a directional bulb
so<00:06:06.840> definitely<00:06:07.680> pleased<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.430> actually<00:06:08.669> see

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
so definitely pleased to actually see

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.700 
so definitely pleased to actually see
some<00:06:09.090> packaging<00:06:09.690> throw<00:06:10.229> a<00:06:10.259> guessing<00:06:10.680> game

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
some packaging throw a guessing game

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.500 
some packaging throw a guessing game
these<00:06:10.979> days

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
these days

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.020 
these days
when<00:06:11.930> you<00:06:12.020> buy<00:06:12.140> an<00:06:12.260> LED<00:06:12.500> bulb<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:13.030> watching

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
when you buy an LED bulb so watching

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.460 
when you buy an LED bulb so watching
give<00:06:14.330> the<00:06:14.450> ball<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:14.690> point<00:06:14.930> here<00:06:15.140> for<00:06:15.350> being

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
give the ball the point here for being

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.370 
give the ball the point here for being
honest<00:06:15.830> as<00:06:16.040> to<00:06:16.340> what<00:06:16.790> you're<00:06:16.940> buying

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
honest as to what you're buying

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.350 
honest as to what you're buying
flicker<00:06:18.380> at<00:06:18.800> both<00:06:19.160> flickers<00:06:19.550> so<00:06:19.880> I'll<00:06:20.120> take<00:06:20.300> a

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
flicker at both flickers so I'll take a

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.490 
flicker at both flickers so I'll take a
point<00:06:20.480> away<00:06:20.600> from<00:06:20.690> that<00:06:20.960> I<00:06:20.990> don't<00:06:21.290> care<00:06:21.440> for

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500

point away from that I don't care for
bulbs<00:06:21.860> it<00:06:21.980> flickers<00:06:22.340> so<00:06:22.610> nothing<00:06:23.150> I'm<00:06:23.420> not

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
bulbs it flickers so nothing I'm not
