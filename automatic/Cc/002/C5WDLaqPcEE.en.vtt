00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:07.089
Everything's ok! Let's go blast it out!!

00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:08.913
Hey, what's wrong Aira?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.239
I can't get excited at all....

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:13.140
Relax,relax...

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.225
I'm worried, what if the customers laugh at me..

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:18.149
Don't worry, I'll be there with you.

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.445
The customer's eyes look scary. The customers are scary..

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:23.806
Calm down Aira.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.660
That's right!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.099
What?

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:26.974
How about sunglasses?

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:28.915
Not those, definitely not those. 

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:30.763
How about this?

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.929
That would make you look really suspicious,,,

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:34.258
Well how about this?

00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:36.477
Those would make you look suspicious, no you would look definitely suspicious..

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:38.444
Is this fine?

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.024
Do you even know what we're doing anymore?

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:45.746
We're doing a Prism Show, and why would you 
 think that would be appropriate for your decor?

00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:47.347
You're right..

00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:49.773
Wouldn't it be alright if you pictured the customers as pumpkins?

00:00:50.243 --> 00:00:52.843
Pumpkins? That would make them look even scarier...

00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:57.843
They wouldn't be lettuce.. Not turnips or eggplants either..

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:00.217
Hey, Rizumu are fruits out of the question as well?

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:01.655
What are you even thinking!!

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:03.898
Look.. just image the things I'm going to say in your head.

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:05.501
Every one of the customers are fruits.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.546
Every one of the customers are fruits..

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.870
Fruits.. Fruits.. Fruits.. Fruits...

00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:16.192
Ah.. I can see them!

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.709
There are a lot of fruity customers. I can smell the aroma as well..

00:01:20.138 --> 00:01:21.138
Right, that's the way!

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.400
Hello there Grapefruit-san.

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:29.357
Wow Pineapple-san.. you and Raspberry-san look great together!

00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:30.358
What Aira?

00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:34.289
Kiwi-san, Mango-san, thanks for cheering for me all this time!

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.024
Aira, that's enough..

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:38.614
All those Cherries, are you doing well?

00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:40.340
Come back to me Aira!

00:01:40.607 --> 00:01:44.710

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:45.830
Aira...

00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:49.800
Apple-san, Orange-san, I thank you for watching all of my shows!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.029
Dried mango-san, do you understand?

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.030
Aira..

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.922
I wasn't saying talking fruits...

00:01:56.922 --> 00:01:58.920
That's it...
