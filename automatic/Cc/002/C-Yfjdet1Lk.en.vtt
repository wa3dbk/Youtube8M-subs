00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
video on the following maps so the first

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.420 
video on the following maps so the first
is<00:00:22.289> shit<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:24.150> an<00:00:24.300> overall<00:00:25.430> map

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
is shit and that's just an overall map

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.480 
is shit and that's just an overall map
of<00:00:26.789> shit<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.260> need<00:00:28.410> clarification<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:29.369> if

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
of shit if you need clarification or if

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.890 
of shit if you need clarification or if
it's<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.760> first<00:00:29.910> time<00:00:30.119> playing<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it's your first time playing it it's a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
it's your first time playing it it's a
good<00:00:31.080> way<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.500> sense<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
good way to get a sense of that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.139 
good way to get a sense of that
so<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> first<00:00:34.200> location<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.910> read<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
so the first location is to read the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.750 
so the first location is to read the
tunnel<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.380> base<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
tunnel out of your base and up into the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.369 
tunnel out of your base and up into the
hangar<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.420> great<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.840> sniping<00:00:40.230> people

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
hangar it's great for sniping people

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.670 
hangar it's great for sniping people
coming<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:40.950> base<00:00:41.250> within<00:00:41.700> Hall<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:43.079> second

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
coming out base within Hall the second

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160 
coming out base within Hall the second
is<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.430> same<00:00:44.670> location<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> reverse

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is the same location but on the reverse

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
is the same location but on the reverse
side<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.770> I'll<00:00:47.730> show<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.329> here

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
side and I'll show you how to get here

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.369 
side and I'll show you how to get here
in<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.410> video<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:51.140> it's<00:00:52.140> pretty

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
in this video right here it's pretty

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.529 
in this video right here it's pretty
easy<00:00:52.590> takes<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.190> couple<00:00:53.370> times<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
easy takes a couple times you need to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.720 
easy takes a couple times you need to
have<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.989> axe<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:56.039> knife<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.579> your

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
have your axe or your knife or your

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
have your axe or your knife or your
shovel<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.690> whatever<00:00:58.140> put<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.859> just

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
shovel or whatever put out so you just

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.060 
shovel or whatever put out so you just
run<00:00:59.309> off<00:00:59.460> there<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.030> jump<00:01:00.359> onto<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
run off there and jump onto that and

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.620 
run off there and jump onto that and
instead<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.570> on

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
instead of going down you can just go on

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
instead of going down you can just go on
outside<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:07.049> either<00:01:07.950> base<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.909> pipe

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
outside of either base it's just a pipe

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.730 
outside of either base it's just a pipe
and<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.390> jump<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.560> look

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and you jump on to it and you can look

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.960 
and you jump on to it and you can look
over<00:01:10.890> onto<00:01:11.280> their<00:01:11.430> base<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> one's<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
over onto their base this one's in the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.670 
over onto their base this one's in the
tunnel<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.810> last<00:01:15.990> video<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.650> just

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
tunnel in the last video that you just

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.580 
tunnel in the last video that you just
saw<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.640> goes<00:01:17.850> under<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.990> perfect<00:01:19.530> for

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
saw that goes under and it's perfect for

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
saw that goes under and it's perfect for
sniping<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.460> once<00:01:20.700> people<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:21.180> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
sniping because once people know you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
sniping because once people know you
there<00:01:21.570> once<00:01:22.080> people<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.710> there

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
there once people know you're there

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
there once people know you're there
they're<00:01:23.520> gonna<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> try<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> kill<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
they're gonna want to try and kill you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
they're gonna want to try and kill you
and<00:01:24.630> they'll<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.990> come<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.740> kill<00:01:25.950> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and they'll just come and the kill is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.580 
and they'll just come and the kill is
just<00:01:26.220> rolling<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.049> starts<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.560> your

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
just rolling this one starts at your

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.929 
just rolling this one starts at your
base<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> do

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
base so you don't really have to do

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.520 
base so you don't really have to do
anything

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
anything

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.310 
anything
travel<00:01:31.530> wise<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.340> right<00:01:32.610> there<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
travel wise it's just right there and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.630 
travel wise it's just right there and
it's<00:01:34.320> pretty<00:01:34.530> much<00:01:34.619> across<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.490> like

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it's pretty much across so it's like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.649 
it's pretty much across so it's like
sniper<00:01:35.939> versus<00:01:36.329> sniper<00:01:36.570> pretty<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
sniper versus sniper pretty much so the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
sniper versus sniper pretty much so the
next<00:01:39.869> map<00:01:40.020> we're<00:01:40.229> gonna<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.920> fortress<00:01:41.610> one

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
next map we're gonna do is fortress one

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.770 
next map we're gonna do is fortress one
of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> newer<00:01:42.509> maps<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.920> crossfire

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
of the newer maps in the crossfire

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
of the newer maps in the crossfire
tsyganov<00:01:45.780> Maps<00:01:46.140> once<00:01:47.040> again<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.579> an<00:01:47.729> overall

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
tsyganov Maps once again just an overall

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.780 
tsyganov Maps once again just an overall
view<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.750> map<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.979> familiarize<00:01:50.640> yourself

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
view of the map to familiarize yourself

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.830 
view of the map to familiarize yourself
with<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.270> some<00:01:54.450> key<00:01:54.659> points

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
with it and you know get some key points

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
with it and you know get some key points
on<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.560> it'll<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.310> also<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.759> your

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
on it and it'll you can also see your

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.520 
on it and it'll you can also see your
teammates<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.259> been

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
teammates on there so if you got been

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
teammates on there so if you got been
it's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.219> useful<00:01:59.640> way<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.149> where<00:02:00.329> your

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it's a very useful way to see where your

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.499 
it's a very useful way to see where your
teammates<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:02.360> first<00:02:03.360> position<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:05.509> through

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
teammates are first position is through

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
so here's Egypt again another diorama so

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.350 
so here's Egypt again another diorama so
you<00:04:09.739> can<00:04:09.980> get<00:04:10.130> yourself<00:04:10.459> used<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:10.910> map<00:04:11.090> as

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
you can get yourself used to the map as

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.449 
you can get yourself used to the map as
you<00:04:12.019> can<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.410> again<00:04:12.739> it's<00:04:13.070> completely

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
you can see again it's completely

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.630 
you can see again it's completely
symmetrical<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.510> each<00:04:14.660> other<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:16.430> only

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
symmetrical to each other so the only

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.330 
symmetrical to each other so the only
difference<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.540> fucking<00:04:18.109> artifacts<00:04:18.620> or

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
difference is the fucking artifacts or

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.370 
difference is the fucking artifacts or
the<00:04:19.790> artwork

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
the artwork

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.339 
the artwork
this<00:04:21.709> one<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.220> sniping<00:04:22.910> from<00:04:23.450> across<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.169> map

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
this one is sniping from across the map

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.080 
this one is sniping from across the map
so<00:04:25.250> you're

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
so you're

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.120 
so you're
one<00:04:26.270> side<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.630> human<00:04:26.810> it's<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.530> same<00:04:27.740> as<00:04:27.919> ship

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
one side of human it's the same as ship

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.070 
one side of human it's the same as ship
you<00:04:28.460> doesn't<00:04:28.880> require<00:04:29.090> much<00:04:29.419> travel<00:04:29.930> or

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
you doesn't require much travel or

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.150 
you doesn't require much travel or
effort<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.710> just<00:04:30.949> see<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.210> snipe<00:04:33.130> yeah

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
effort you just see it and snipe yeah

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.280 
effort you just see it and snipe yeah
people<00:04:34.699> go<00:04:34.850> through<00:04:35.000> that<00:04:35.180> way<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:36.050> last
