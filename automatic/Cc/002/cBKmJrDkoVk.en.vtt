perfect so let's check this out so there

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.630 
perfect so let's check this out so there
is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.180> sway<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> find<00:00:42.899> out<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.590> our<00:00:43.829> card<00:00:44.280> alive

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
is a sway to find out if our card alive

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.290 
is a sway to find out if our card alive
or<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.059> typed<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.140> too<00:00:46.530> light<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.160> by<00:00:47.910> grabbing

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
or not typed or too light is by grabbing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.610 
or not typed or too light is by grabbing
this<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.649> moving<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.170> yellow

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this and and moving it so if it's yellow

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.880 
this and and moving it so if it's yellow
it's<00:00:53.039> good<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.260> perfect<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it's good to go it will be perfect to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.939 
it's good to go it will be perfect to
eat<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.020> green<00:00:58.379> let's<00:00:58.739> check
