00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:15.849
 Hi, I teach Hangul to the wheat board today Orange two friends studying 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.570
 I should come. 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:29.849
 Today, I want to study Korean 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 I'll show you how to hold a losing draw. 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:40.110
 How to hold a pencil may seem very difficult at first 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.559
 If you get used to it, we 'll help you write better. 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.559
 Follow me. 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.340
 First with a thumb and index finger 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.340
 JAVA pencil 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.070
 It's too hard to write like this. 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.070
 With the remaining three fingers 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.970
 It's supporting the pencil . 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.120
 To be like this 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.850
 like this 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:16.380
 I do not write well if I write it down . 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.460
 The little finger is tilted slightly 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 So close all day 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.900
 These three fingers together hold the pencil 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:35.200
 It's holding the sheepskin with the index finger and thumb . 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:39.570
 Then I'll use Digg Dick to remember Le Hangul. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.570
 g2 chee 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:50.600
 As today's first try to practice seongeutgi 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:54.320
 I'll try to get my pencil to get used to it, but hold it with your thumb and index finger. 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.670
 Gonna foot for the remaining three fingers 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:04.130
 The little finger is all day long. 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.720
 I did not build a pencil , but at an angle 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:13.620
 And the left hand 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 Put it on the inside of the bell, keep the paper from moving, 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.880
 I can not stand the posture . 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.880
 Straighten your waist 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.680
 You can write slowly and slowly. 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.620
 If you catch this pencil, you are ready to write Hangul. 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:40.930
 We have fun again tomorrow Alphabetical 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.930
