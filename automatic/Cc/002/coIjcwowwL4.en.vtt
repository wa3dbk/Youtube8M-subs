really<00:00:51.150> good<00:00:51.300> mid<00:00:51.480> jazz<00:00:51.660> bp's<00:00:52.080> probably<00:00:52.470> one

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
really good mid jazz bp's probably one

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
really good mid jazz bp's probably one
of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.740> longest-lasting<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> game<00:00:53.760> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
of the longest-lasting on the game it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.850 
of the longest-lasting on the game it
gets<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:54.930> good<00:00:55.080> boost<00:00:55.290> see<00:00:55.830> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
gets that really good boost see I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.230 
gets that really good boost see I
managed<00:00:56.130> to<00:00:56.160> pull<00:00:56.340> away<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.760> Messara

there

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.049 

so<00:01:02.680> coming<00:01:03.010> in<00:01:03.100> at<00:01:03.160> birth<00:01:03.399> we've<00:01:03.640> actually<00:01:03.790> got

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
so coming in at birth we've actually got

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.520 
so coming in at birth we've actually got
a<00:01:04.089> muscle<00:01:04.330> car<00:01:04.600> which<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:04.989> vapid<00:01:05.320> blade

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
a muscle car which is the vapid blade

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.960 
a muscle car which is the vapid blade
it's<00:01:06.010> got<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.159> great<00:01:06.460> launch<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.850> it's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
it's got a great launch and it's

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's got a great launch and it's
probably<00:01:07.210> got<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.420> best<00:01:07.570> with<00:01:07.869> drive<00:01:08.050> speed

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
probably got the best with drive speed

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.990 
probably got the best with drive speed
boost<00:01:08.500> on<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.650> game<00:01:08.920> last<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.610> long<00:01:09.760> time<00:01:09.790> you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
boost on the game last a long time you

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.890 
boost on the game last a long time you
get<00:01:10.300> a<00:01:10.330> hell<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.780> boost<00:01:11.020> from<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.750> I'll

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
get a hell of a boost from it so I'll

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.300 
get a hell of a boost from it so I'll
run<00:01:17.050> Rob<00:01:17.290> here<00:01:17.440> guys<00:01:17.650> is<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.100> bow<00:01:18.250> she

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
run Rob here guys is that the bow she

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.999 
run Rob here guys is that the bow she
rapid<00:01:18.759> GT<00:01:19.119> it's<00:01:19.540> got<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.690> great<00:01:19.960> launch<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.860> mid

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
rapid GT it's got a great launch the mid

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.320 
rapid GT it's got a great launch the mid
to<00:01:21.100> high<00:01:21.130> speed<00:01:21.400> boost<00:01:21.580> isn't<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.880> best<00:01:22.090> but

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
to high speed boost isn't the best but

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.080 
to high speed boost isn't the best but
its<00:01:23.259> acceleration<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:24.100> just<00:01:24.220> insane<00:01:24.670> as<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:25.000> is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
its acceleration is just insane as it is

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.380 
its acceleration is just insane as it is
anyway<00:01:29.610> taking<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.700> top<00:01:30.940> spot<00:01:30.970> in<00:01:31.210> the

anyway taking the top spot in the

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.820 
anyway taking the top spot in the
drifting<00:01:31.690> category<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.320> was<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.500> bravado

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
drifting category it was the bravado

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.370 
drifting category it was the bravado
bungee<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.610> here<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.090> again<00:01:34.390> first<00:01:35.050> on<00:01:35.289> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
bungee and here it is again first on the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.680 
bungee and here it is again first on the
drag<00:01:35.590> racers<00:01:36.009> got<00:01:36.610> great<00:01:36.880> launch<00:01:37.119> amazing

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
drag racers got great launch amazing

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.600 
drag racers got great launch amazing
Madrid<00:01:38.020> speed<00:01:38.259> boost<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.039> acceleration

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
Madrid speed boost and the acceleration

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.490 
Madrid speed boost and the acceleration
is<00:01:39.880> just<00:01:40.030> insane<00:01:40.539> it<00:01:40.750> could<00:01:40.869> probably<00:01:41.050> be<00:01:41.200> any

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
is just insane it could probably be any

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.219 
is just insane it could probably be any
