so<00:01:21.040> we're<00:01:21.190> just<00:01:21.220> gonna<00:01:21.400> put<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.760> cup<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:22.180> flour

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
so we're just gonna put a cup of flour

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.300 
so we're just gonna put a cup of flour
in<00:01:22.750> here<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.080> some<00:01:26.290> some<00:01:26.740> whole<00:01:26.979> rye

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
in here and this is some some whole rye

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.540 
in here and this is some some whole rye
flour<00:01:27.640> that<00:01:28.540> will<00:01:29.290> already<00:01:29.620> have<00:01:29.740> some<00:01:30.250> yeast

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
flour that will already have some yeast

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.930 
flour that will already have some yeast
and<00:01:31.050> bacteria<00:01:32.050> growing<00:01:32.410> in<00:01:32.650> it<00:01:32.830> which<00:01:33.729> is

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
and bacteria growing in it which is

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.700 
and bacteria growing in it which is
would<00:01:36.940> have<00:01:37.060> actually<00:01:37.360> started<00:01:37.840> growing<00:01:38.470> on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
would have actually started growing on

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.410 
would have actually started growing on
the<00:01:39.070> plant<00:01:39.369> itself<00:01:39.820> before<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.360> was<00:01:40.600> milled<00:01:40.930> so

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the plant itself before it was milled so

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.140 
the plant itself before it was milled so
we<00:01:43.420> have<00:01:43.540> our<00:01:43.690> flour<00:01:43.900> in<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.320> jar<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.030> that's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
we have our flour in the jar and that's

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.070 
we have our flour in the jar and that's
all<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.540> need<00:01:46.690> one<00:01:47.020> cup<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.500> flour<00:01:48.330> then<00:01:49.330> we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
all we need one cup of flour then we

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.900 
all we need one cup of flour then we
have<00:01:50.170> one<00:01:50.350> cup<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.650> water<00:01:53.340> add<00:01:54.340> your<00:01:54.670> water

you'll<00:03:04.959> know<00:03:05.079> already<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.500> yeast<00:03:05.829> is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you'll know already that yeast is

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.620 
you'll know already that yeast is
everywhere<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:07.060> all<00:03:07.150> we're<00:03:07.269> doing<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.510> we're

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
everywhere so all we're doing is we're

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.970 
everywhere so all we're doing is we're
taking<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:07.930> natural<00:03:08.350> yeast<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.709> floats

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
taking this natural yeast that floats

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.039 
taking this natural yeast that floats
around<00:03:09.100> all<00:03:09.459> around<00:03:09.760> us<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.120> we're<00:03:10.720> gonna<00:03:10.810> go

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
around all around us and we're gonna go

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.420 
around all around us and we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> start<00:03:11.680> our<00:03:11.829> cultures<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.340> our

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
ahead and start our cultures and our

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.580 
ahead and start our cultures and our
fermentation<00:03:12.640> within<00:03:13.390> our<00:03:13.510> starter<00:03:13.930> picking

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
fermentation within our starter picking

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.670 
fermentation within our starter picking
up<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.920> yeast<00:03:15.160> from<00:03:15.400> our<00:03:15.549> surroundings

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.080 

so<00:03:19.400> now<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.610> we've<00:03:19.790> got<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.060> mixed<00:03:20.269> up<00:03:20.510> well

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so now that we've got it mixed up well

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.759 
so now that we've got it mixed up well
this<00:03:23.090> thing<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.450> pretty<00:03:23.840> much<00:03:24.080> ready<00:03:24.349> to<00:03:24.440> sit

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
this thing is pretty much ready to sit

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.140 
this thing is pretty much ready to sit
overnight<00:03:25.069> but<00:03:25.489> we're<00:03:25.640> gonna<00:03:25.730> give<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.000> a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
overnight but we're gonna give it a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.350 
overnight but we're gonna give it a
little<00:03:26.330> bit<00:03:26.569> of<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.780> boost<00:03:28.299> now<00:03:29.299> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
little bit of a boost now the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.300 
little bit of a boost now the
interesting<00:03:29.720> thing<00:03:30.440> about<00:03:30.470> yeast<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:33.310> these

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
interesting thing about yeast and these

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.899 
interesting thing about yeast and these
bacterias<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:36.409> they<00:03:36.950> actually<00:03:37.190> consume

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
bacterias is that they actually consume

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.410 
bacterias is that they actually consume
sugar<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:39.159> as<00:03:40.159> a<00:03:40.190> by-product<00:03:40.819> they'll<00:03:41.090> create

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
sugar and as a by-product they'll create

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.569 
sugar and as a by-product they'll create
both<00:03:41.840> alcohol<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.470> co2<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:46.220> we're<00:03:46.400> going<00:03:46.519> to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
both alcohol and co2 so we're going to

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.309 
both alcohol and co2 so we're going to
give<00:03:46.730> our<00:03:46.909> seduced<00:03:47.299> with<00:03:47.840> some<00:03:48.019> brown<00:03:48.290> rice

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
give our seduced with some brown rice

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.960 
give our seduced with some brown rice
serious<00:03:51.099> yeast<00:03:52.099> essentially<00:03:52.609> needs<00:03:52.790> two

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
serious yeast essentially needs two

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.830 
serious yeast essentially needs two
things<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.299> survive<00:03:53.859> oxygen<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.040> sugar<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
things to survive oxygen and sugar the

things to survive oxygen and sugar the
sugar<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.349> food<00:03:57.560> source<00:03:57.859> as<00:03:58.310> Nick<00:03:58.549> said

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
sugar is the food source as Nick said

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.270 
sugar is the food source as Nick said
the<00:03:58.849> byproducts<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.569> co2<00:03:59.900> co2<00:04:00.799> is<00:04:01.160> going

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
the byproducts of you co2 co2 is going

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.559 
the byproducts of you co2 co2 is going
to<00:04:01.340> be<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.519> leavening<00:04:01.849> agent<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.239> help<00:04:02.420> our

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
to be the leavening agent to help our

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.390 
to be the leavening agent to help our
bread<00:04:02.840> rise<00:04:03.079> that's<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.920> whole<00:04:04.069> reason<00:04:04.099> that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
bread rise that's the whole reason that

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.309 
bread rise that's the whole reason that
we're<00:04:04.549> making<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:04.909> started<00:04:08.019> okay<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:09.049> we

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
we're making this started okay so we

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.080 
we're making this started okay so we
have<00:04:09.440> our<00:04:09.470> syrup<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.129> there<00:04:10.340> we're<00:04:10.760> just<00:04:10.970> gonna

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
have our syrup in there we're just gonna

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.930 
have our syrup in there we're just gonna
stir<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.599> in<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:15.680> about<00:04:15.859> 24<00:04:16.370> hours<00:04:16.729> we'll

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
stir that in and in about 24 hours we'll

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.610 
stir that in and in about 24 hours we'll
notice<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:17.510> is<00:04:17.570> starting<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.139> separate

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
notice that this is starting to separate

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.789 
notice that this is starting to separate
back<00:04:18.919> into<00:04:19.310> you'll<00:04:20.060> see<00:04:20.209> you'll<00:04:20.539> see<00:04:20.799> your

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
back into you'll see you'll see your

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.279 
back into you'll see you'll see your
slurry<00:04:22.220> on<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.639> bottom<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:24.849> there<00:04:25.849> will<00:04:25.970> be<00:04:26.000> a

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
slurry on the bottom and there will be a

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.560

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
layer of liquid on the top now that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.180 
layer of liquid on the top now that
that's<00:04:29.900> when<00:04:30.169> we<00:04:30.320> know<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.800> yeast<00:04:30.979> and

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
that's when we know that the yeast and

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.010 
that's when we know that the yeast and
bacteria<00:04:31.729> have<00:04:31.910> actually<00:04:32.300> started<00:04:32.539> consuming

point<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:04.220> can<00:05:04.400> see<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.880> separation<00:05:05.419> between

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
point you can see the separation between

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.189 
point you can see the separation between
the<00:05:07.220> flour<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.789> water<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:09.080> byproduct

the flour and water and the byproduct
which<00:05:10.439> is<00:05:10.590> alcohol<00:05:11.360> they<00:05:12.360> used<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.659> call<00:05:12.810> it

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
which is alcohol they used to call it

hooch back in the San Francisco days
which<00:05:15.120> is<00:05:15.270> where<00:05:15.419> we<00:05:15.599> get<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:16.129> name<00:05:17.840> miners

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
which is where we get that name miners

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.749 
which is where we get that name miners
would<00:05:19.080> actually<00:05:19.560> when<00:05:20.219> making<00:05:20.460> their

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
would actually when making their

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.279 
would actually when making their
sourdough<00:05:21.330> pour<00:05:22.080> this<00:05:22.349> off<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:22.889> drink<00:05:23.279> it<00:05:24.289> so

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
here so as you can see we got a starter

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.290 
here so as you can see we got a starter
here<00:05:31.379> nikka<00:05:31.650> already<00:05:31.919> started<00:05:32.249> this<00:05:32.370> one<00:05:32.610> you

here nikka already started this one you

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.730 
here nikka already started this one you
can<00:05:33.419> see<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.659> separation<00:05:34.229> when<00:05:34.379> he<00:05:34.439> means<00:05:34.590> by

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
can see the separation when he means by

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.679 
can see the separation when he means by
feeding<00:05:35.099> it<00:05:35.249> is<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:36.090> next<00:05:36.300> day<00:05:36.419> we'll<00:05:36.569> add<00:05:36.659> a

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
feeding it is the next day we'll add a

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:38.119 
feeding it is the next day we'll add a
little<00:05:36.840> bit<00:05:37.020> more<00:05:37.050> water<00:05:37.409> and<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.889> little<00:05:38.039> bit

little bit more water and a little bit
more<00:05:38.370> flour<00:05:38.639> just<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.449> get<00:05:39.569> that<00:05:39.749> yeast<00:05:39.930> nice

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
more flour just to get that yeast nice

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.899 
more flour just to get that yeast nice
and<00:05:40.409> activated<00:05:40.919> you<00:05:41.279> start<00:05:41.580> seeing<00:05:41.699> a<00:05:41.759> little
