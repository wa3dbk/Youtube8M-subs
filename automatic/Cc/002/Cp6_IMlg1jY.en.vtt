00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.460
 hello everyone who collects jmr psh and 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.920
 Well today I bring you another check this time 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.410
 it is a new exclusive multi 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.450
 for expected servants of metidos I've 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.790
 been testing thousands of ways and 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.980
 trying to work in the meeting 2 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.289
 point is but there is no way it does not work 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
 so unfortunately we are left to 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.699
 exclusive use of private servers 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.949
 Ok I'll tell you a little about the multi 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.650
 check is a multi hack I already told you 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.989
 for private servers do not contain 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.879
 no novel function that we do not have 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.100
 seen never again 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.110
 basically it contains what it has in the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.299
 most multi hacks so neither 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.430
 let's say it's a very good hack but 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.629
 good as you know I always upload everything 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.909
 what I find so you have 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.979
 let's say a wider range of tools 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.510
 to use so good I hope that 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.309
 you like, we start with the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.170
 installation first of all as 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.820
 it would always be to download the file that 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.710
 it would be this here you have it in the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.210
 description of the video is worth and once 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.460
 we have it we are going to give it to extract 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.110
 let's bring here and if it's going to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.450
 unzip in this folder that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.950
 contains these two files worth I want 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.200
 tell me what it detects 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.680
 those in jet like virus at least the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.719
 avast calm that nothing happens is a 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.490
 injected most hacks use it and 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.979
 I always wash it recognizes me as 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.409
 virus but be 100% sure that no 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.060
 nothing happens, you 're worth it 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.340
 move on from this for now what are we going to 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 do is going to be enter the server worth 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 I'm going to do the test this time with him 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.189
 putting the world that I always do 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.799
 with the putting is guabina because this time 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.990
 I played with another new basic I do 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.030
 with the world is that of which 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.770
 by the way I remember that I did recently 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.630
 a server presentation of this 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.520
 server the truth is that it is quite 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 well it's the ones that are very difficult to 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.360
 go up and well let's go there 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.640
 Now what I'm going to do is explain you 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.899
 the functions you have there are some that 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.750
 they do not work 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.329
 and others that are premium so now 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.700
 I'm going to explain everything, be careful 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.380
 because there are some things that are a bit 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.299
 complex to understand if you do not know how 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.429
 it works and it's worth then once 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.200
 we are inside we will open the folder that 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.480
 we have decompressed and we are going to execute 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.090
 the injector is worth we will execute it as 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 administrator I think it is not necessary 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.380
 but always in case we do 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.540
 ok then we choose here the process 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.370
 we have to always find something 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.590
 similar to this tucked client point 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.540
 well it will be without the client 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.750
 good what you put putting you 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.820
 then we select it and here we have 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.200
 that find this file here according to 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.270
 where we have extracted it in my case 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 is on desktop in this folder here 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.960
 as you see, it gives us now to select 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.000
 this file is worth double click 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.010
 about him and then he would already be 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.930
 configured what we have to do is 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.060
 give him to inject we give him injected and if 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.310
 everything works well the window will not come out 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.080
 of the hack okay then let's see what 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.750
 I will now explain the functions that 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.910
 It is worth a voucher so that 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.640
 you understand everything is worth the first 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.660
 feedlot cooper this as many of you will know 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.660
 it's so super 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.100
 so that the first item of the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.170
 inventory is worth this sword for example 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.520
 + 1 then what we have to do is 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.740
 put it in the first game of 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.050
 inventory come to the window this and 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.750
 put down here 1 okay then let's 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.200
 we put 1 and we go to enter and as you see 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.210
 it has gone up worth it is worth some 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.460
 you asked in other videos if this 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.500
 It does not do it for free and if you ask 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.540
 objects will also ask us so 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.510
 that serves so that we do not have to be 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.340
 going to read it is worth then we go to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.820
 the second function what you have is 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.710
 also in terms of improvement but 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.180
 this would not go up we place if we are 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.430
 inside the tower demons forgiveness 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.350
 then once we are in the tower 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.880
 demons on the ground as blacksmith 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.010
 it would simply be that for instead of 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.140
 throw the object to the blacksmith so that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.950
 raise it as it has happened right now 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.010
 truth is that it does not make much sense 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.410
 but good is the third the car 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.000
 potter as you know then so that he uses 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.500
 potions horace e vale this is 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.230
 important you have to leave the first 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.150
 free inventory row is worth only 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.130
 the boots that you want to use then in 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.720
 my case for example would be using the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.850
 blue and red boots 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.810
 we would go here to activate it we could the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.760
 3 we give to enter and here it tells us 1 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.799
 to turn it on and 2 to turn it off 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.040
 We put 1 we give again to enter and 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.960
 would use would be using the car to be able 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.400
 as we are going to see kisses the support to a 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.500
 only pass would serve vale boys worth 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.810
 fourth function is the auto item pick up 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.520
 serves to take objects only 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.470
 just good do not need to be 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.600
 explain but that having follow-up is 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.880
 give it to 4 then here tells us what 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.860
 same for one to activate it and for 2 a 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.900
 pay it in two we give one and it would be 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.180
 activated voucher worth we pass to the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.250
 next is the auto attack so that 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.480
 attack only before we would put 5 what 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.670
 We would also do one to activate and 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.460
 As you can see, it starts attacking only one 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.150
 serious to turn it off we would give 5 and 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.970
 let's go to 2 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.730
 then I would stop attacking only 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.169
 the hidden attack this one also as I have 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.990
 said before is only for users 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.270
 premium so nothing the fast kick this 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.220
 it's the same as the auto item pick up 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.260
 but they do it faster so more 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.639
 fast so I recommend you to put 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.680
 this ballet 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.960
 then 8 and 9 do not work so 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.599
 we do not pay attention to them, it's 10 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.520
 It will be 8 9 and 10 do not work anymore 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.219
 I feel but they do not work 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.499
 then the mod pool this one either but yes 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.840
 that the car works that is for 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:34.199
 I use ropes every 20 seconds only 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.270
 then we had to 12 we are going to enter and 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.729
 1 and as we will see now as 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.439
 start using fields alone good already 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.969
 you will see now that he likes corporals 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.090
 I will continue explaining the following 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:47.460
 function discomfort and to the 13 the speed hack 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.949
 we put here 13 and now we 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.189
 put how much we want to increase it 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.319
 I recommend putting 300 for example 300 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:57.479
 It's pretty good and as you can see 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.639
 run much faster it's worth it here 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.520
 As you can see, start using the ends 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:06.000
 every 20 seconds and that this would be good 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.860
 the speed hack is worth what else 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.889
 we have the combo check then we would give 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.839
 to 14 and we put 2 is always worth two for 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.669
 which is so that as you know then the 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.310
 combo it will be one to two sides 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.120
 works better so we give two and 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.090
 as you will see then use 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.580
 as you see use the combo worth 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.070
 attack speed hack this is simply 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.389
 to attack faster we put 15 and here 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.940
 the same we can how much we want 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.160
 increase it for example 200 and as you see 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.620
 you can attack faster 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.960
 then to see what more is more this 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.120
 it does not work anymore either, it 's just for 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.090
 premium users so nothing is worth as 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.919
 You still use the hack of heads 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.470
 we follow player's hit this is for 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.270
 make them invisible but you're going to 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.040
 to be able to see you others 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.710
 players are going to see us so either 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.110
 It makes a lot of sense to use it and we already have 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.210
 to the last function of a hack you 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.180
 We will do 18 and here I recommend that 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.250
 you put more or less 5,000 each way up more 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.710
 if you put for example six thousand then 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.570
 will put more zoom and with five thousand then 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.630
 comes to this from distance is worth I think 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.889
 that is more than enough this distance 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.590
 from a going so good that that as 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.960
 you want 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.060
 and good if it is here to everything I think 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.650
 explained everything I think I do not think what 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.140
 I explain well and I do not expect 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.460
 no doubt anyway I will be no 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.920
 matter answer or if you have any 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.500
 simply ask the comentáis in the 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.300
 comments and I will try to answer it and 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.380
 good guys that has been all I hope that
