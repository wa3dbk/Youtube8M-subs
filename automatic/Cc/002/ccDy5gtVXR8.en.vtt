now<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.520> where<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
now but I don't think it's where it

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
now but I don't think it's where it
should<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.079> not<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.680> it's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
should be it's not I don't think it's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
should be it's not I don't think it's
sharp<00:01:20.549> enough<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:21.060> other<00:01:21.240> guys<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.869> I'm

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
sharp enough like other guys so I'm

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:58.980 
sharp enough like other guys so I'm
working<00:01:22.469> on<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.799> consistently
