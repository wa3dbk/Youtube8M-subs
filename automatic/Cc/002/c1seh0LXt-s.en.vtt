 here 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.120
 divine of songs that we have been 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.430
 part of my life although many people 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.739
 it is also to God because all the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.689
 world has a romantic song that 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.670
 remember something let's say for us it's 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.980
 very special because I think it was a 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.909
 song apart from my life and my career 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.290
 no hinge before and after 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.090
 this song are advertising by the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.370
 theater that the mirage is between novels 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.829
 It is also a Hollywood movie 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.090
 it was also a song that really 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.459
 it gave us a lot of repercussion in many 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.019
 countries but it was the first one that we 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.269
 international made strong was the song 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.349
 of the year in puerto rico in the year 2006 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.959
 also so it was important genius not 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.989
 did you know door of colombia de ecuador 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.530
 also so it was very important the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.770
 pleasure 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.020
 we are going to be a bit of 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.860
 the song that is part of your life 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.860
 why did you transcribe 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.350
 we make this vice not only give you the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.350
 chorus 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.510
 how 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.560
 all this world 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.980
 when more l 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.290
 the years go by I see her more beautiful and not 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.090
 I can / 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.090
 That I continue so lonely in life 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.090
 searching 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.139
 just look at it 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:36.050
 and I do not understand that I'm still so alone 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.050
 looking for what 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:51.389
 the day 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:55.729
 it's fantastic but other than that it's like 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.729
 it's like autobiographical 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.789
 I'm not very attentive so I'm attentive 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:05.519
 to what happens around me and good without 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:12.199
