you know I'm really going to want to be

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.960 
you know I'm really going to want to be
playing<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.049> game<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> perfect

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
playing a game and this is a perfect

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
playing a game and this is a perfect
game<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.270> play<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.630> before<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> release<00:01:34.350> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
game to play just before the release of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.100 
game to play just before the release of
the<00:01:34.530> ps4<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> hopefully<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> will<00:01:36.780> come<00:01:36.960> out

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the ps4 and hopefully it will come out

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.660 
the ps4 and hopefully it will come out
on<00:01:37.140> next-gen<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.549> reason

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
on next-gen but I don't know some reason

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.310 
on next-gen but I don't know some reason
I've<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> feeling<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.689> might<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:40.020> um

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
I've just got a feeling it might not um

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.740 
I've just got a feeling it might not um
the<00:01:41.220> game<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.210> game<00:01:42.360> world<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the game you know the game world is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
the game you know the game world is
massive<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.950> generally

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
massive as you can as you can generally

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.950 
massive as you can as you can generally
see<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.689> hard

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
see here this is going to be really hard

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
see here this is going to be really hard
to<00:01:46.020> escape<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.470> bloody<00:01:46.770> cops<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.670> cops

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to escape these bloody cops the cops

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
to escape these bloody cops the cops
seem<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.450> smarter<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:49.110> well<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
seem a lot smarter as well which is I

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760 
seem a lot smarter as well which is I
guess<00:01:50.460> both<00:01:51.329> good<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.780> bad<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.470> way<00:01:52.500> because

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
guess both good and bad in a way because

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.399 
guess both good and bad in a way because
it<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> harder<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.399> escape<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.409> they're

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
it is harder to escape them now they're

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.319 
it is harder to escape them now they're
a<00:01:55.439> lot<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.490> tactical<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.149> stuff

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
a lot more you know tactical and stuff

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.450 
a lot more you know tactical and stuff
and<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.350> are<00:01:58.439> fast<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.040> cars<00:01:59.310> at

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and they really are fast all the cars at

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.889 
and they really are fast all the cars at
the<00:01:59.490> cops<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.149> Ram<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.750> well

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the cops and what they Ram you as well

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
the cops and what they Ram you as well
and<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:01.890> hard<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> evade<00:02:02.490> them

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and it's it's really hard to evade them

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.630 
and it's it's really hard to evade them
but<00:02:02.880> um<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> combat<00:02:04.979> arm<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.399> haven't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
characters as I said it just awesome I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.700 
characters as I said it just awesome I
really<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.480> Franklin<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.140> particular<00:02:40.380> on

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
really like Franklin in particular on

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.470 
really like Franklin in particular on
because<00:02:41.610> they're<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:41.880> sort<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.240> that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
because they're not sort of that

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.180 
because they're not sort of that
stereotypical<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:43.770> live<00:02:43.950> really

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
stereotypical that they all live really

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.620 
stereotypical that they all live really
different<00:02:44.670> sort<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.940> lives<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.390> they're<00:02:45.480> all

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
different sort of lives and they're all

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.540 
different sort of lives and they're all
different<00:02:46.140> sort<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.530> characters<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
different sort of characters and the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.040 
different sort of characters and the
fact<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.030> three<00:02:48.300> characters<00:02:48.750> now<00:02:48.870> is

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
fact we have three characters now is

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.210 
fact we have three characters now is
really<00:02:49.260> good<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.830> means<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.070> can

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
really good because it means you can

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.710 
really good because it means you can
actually<00:02:50.370> get<00:02:50.610> around<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> world<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.270> lot<00:02:51.390> sort

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
actually get around the world a lot sort

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.870 
actually get around the world a lot sort
