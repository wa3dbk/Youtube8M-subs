00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
doing he say static but if you're just

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.640 
doing he say static but if you're just
by<00:02:19.370> yourself<00:02:19.400> playing<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.319> static

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
by yourself playing this the static

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.589 
by yourself playing this the static
noise<00:02:21.800> don't<00:02:21.980> sound<00:02:22.280> very<00:02:22.430> good<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.330> that's

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
noise don't sound very good so that's

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.870 
noise don't sound very good so that's
the<00:02:23.780> Harmony<00:02:24.290> behind<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.190> only<00:02:25.640> other

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
the Harmony behind it the only other

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.259 
the Harmony behind it the only other
part<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:27.530> bridge<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.370> again<00:02:29.030> we're<00:02:29.150> going

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
part is the bridge and again we're going
