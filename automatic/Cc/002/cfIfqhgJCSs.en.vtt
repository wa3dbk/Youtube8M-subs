00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 they'd like you with me you're not 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:10.390
 I'm photos of mistakes yesterday in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.090
 life how many times I will change again 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.780
 devotees in the tower will make a mistake they would like you 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.420
 with minus 6 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.800
 fruit of errors nothing 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 in life how many times I will change again 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.110
 many still too many mistakes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.540
 now they make me think about the time 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.850
 I understand that it means growing up and dead 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.480
 the look at what I was maybe I am not 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.610
 never been able to really love a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.830
 stability I haven't even found yet 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.309
 a sense I'm not mistaken I am a 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.420
 crossroads 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.570
 I think what makes me what money is 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.540
 women do not make me a man but a 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 confused boy from rash choices from 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.280
 put what you expect at the age of twenty 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.100
 I probably won't have anything anymore 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.650
 I won't even be thinking about the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.860
 present unfortunately you don't know how many times 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.350
 I would have preferred to leave them from above 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.350
 of that share everything we have 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.810
 lived will always remain regardless 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 from rejection 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.490
 it is not true with less 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.270
 that are the result of errors 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.490
 in life with devotees I will still change 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.490
 how many times I will fail you 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 they would like with less 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.970
 nothing but errors 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.970
 in life how many times still room 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.850
 how many times I found myself thrown 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.280
 under a sofa looking at the ceiling 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.010
 I have been wrong too many times in my life 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.830
 but despite the excuses and the same in 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.860
 conflict with my thoughts what I had 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.130
 done but proud of not getting out 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.470
 defeated I go ahead and fight there I have 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.320
 understood that the only real friend is that 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.110
 who speak and not what is silent and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.990
 if human make a mistake, persevere diabolico 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.030
 I am satan because I insist even if I have 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.850
 the stomach time I am not afraid of 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.620
 making mistakes can only strengthen me if 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.959
 believe in yourself nothing can 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.970
 change the most beautiful error I have 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.130
 done and I don't hold a grudge even though 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.770
 inside I'm bursting convinced that the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.810
 detachment will help us find ourselves in the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.370
 come back up 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.510
 it is not true with less 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 and they are the result of errors 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.500
 in life how many times I will change again 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.020
 how many times I will fail you 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.430
 they would like with less 6 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.010
 no mistakes nothing 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.010
 in life how many times more cameron
