and<00:01:31.920> furthermore<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.970> allowed<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.299> throw

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and furthermore you're allowed to throw

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.450 
and furthermore you're allowed to throw
hats<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> ice<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> hockey<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.310> there's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
hats on the ice and hockey when there's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.219 
hats on the ice and hockey when there's
hatrocks<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.390> what's<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> difference

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
hatrocks so really what's the difference

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.899 
hatrocks so really what's the difference
it's<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> same<00:01:37.740> motion<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> same<00:01:38.640> act

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
it's the same motion that's the same act

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
it's the same motion that's the same act
so<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.780> hope<00:01:39.930> those<00:01:40.140> fans<00:01:40.409> didn't<00:01:40.770> get

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

tonight this is a very absurd demand for
him<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.069> make<00:03:06.190> because<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.030> bottom<00:03:07.269> line<00:03:07.450> is

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
him to make because the bottom line is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.780 
him to make because the bottom line is
this<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.079> he<00:03:08.200> wasn't<00:03:08.560> happy<00:03:08.769> with<00:03:08.980> Ottawa<00:03:09.430> he

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
this if he wasn't happy with Ottawa he

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.880 
this if he wasn't happy with Ottawa he
could<00:03:10.000> have<00:03:10.060> written<00:03:10.690> out<00:03:10.900> his<00:03:11.079> contract<00:03:11.319> and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
could have written out his contract and

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.640 
could have written out his contract and
then<00:03:12.400> decided<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.420> sign<00:03:13.660> whatever<00:03:13.930> he<00:03:14.379> wanted
