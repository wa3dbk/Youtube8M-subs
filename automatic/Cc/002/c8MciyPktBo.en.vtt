I<00:01:46.690> think<00:01:47.050> it<00:01:47.140> wears<00:01:47.380> well<00:01:47.650> like<00:01:47.860> usually<00:01:48.250> my

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
I think it wears well like usually my

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.940 
I think it wears well like usually my
t-zone<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:49.030> super<00:01:49.360> oily<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.439> think<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.740> does

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
t-zone is super oily and I think it does

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.210 
t-zone is super oily and I think it does
good<00:01:51.220> although<00:01:51.990> nothing<00:01:52.990> can<00:01:53.320> stay<00:01:53.590> matte<00:01:53.830> on

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
good although nothing can stay matte on

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.330 
good although nothing can stay matte on
my<00:01:54.729> nose<00:01:54.970> like<00:01:55.210> my<00:01:55.479> nose<00:01:55.720> is<00:01:55.990> an<00:01:56.110> oily<00:01:56.530> mess<00:01:56.560> so

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
my nose like my nose is an oily mess so

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.190 
my nose like my nose is an oily mess so
usually<00:01:57.700> by<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.909> end<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.299> day<00:01:58.450> that's

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
usually by the end of the day that's

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.020 
usually by the end of the day that's
shiny<00:01:59.740> but<00:02:00.130> that's<00:02:00.310> with<00:02:00.520> like<00:02:00.670> every

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
shiny but that's with like every

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.090 
shiny but that's with like every
foundation<00:02:01.390> but<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.229> do<00:02:02.350> like<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.829> way<00:02:02.920> this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
foundation but I do like the way this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.620 
foundation but I do like the way this
swears<00:02:03.369> because<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.909> does<00:02:04.030> keep<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.329> rest<00:02:04.509> of

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
swears because it does keep the rest of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.390 
swears because it does keep the rest of
my<00:02:04.720> face<00:02:04.869> matte<00:02:05.259> during<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.710> day<00:02:05.860> but<00:02:05.920> like<00:02:06.250> I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
my face matte during the day but like I

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.740 
my face matte during the day but like I
said<00:02:06.460> except<00:02:06.820> for<00:02:06.970> my<00:02:07.060> nose<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.509> that's<00:02:07.659> just

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
said except for my nose but that's just

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.630 
said except for my nose but that's just
my<00:02:07.900> nose<00:02:07.960> but<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.709> think<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.070> would<00:02:09.250> also<00:02:09.399> be

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
my nose but I think this would also be

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.340 
my nose but I think this would also be
good<00:02:09.790> for<00:02:10.090> like<00:02:10.119> if<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.450> have<00:02:10.630> normal<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.019> dry

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
good for like if you have normal to dry

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.380 
good for like if you have normal to dry
skin<00:02:11.380> because<00:02:12.280> like<00:02:12.579> I<00:02:12.670> said<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.940> doesn't<00:02:13.090> have

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
skin because like I said it doesn't have

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.090 
skin because like I said it doesn't have
that<00:02:13.450> just<00:02:13.989> matte<00:02:14.850> dry<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:17.380> like<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.650> overly

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
that just matte dry or like that overly

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.670 
that just matte dry or like that overly
matte<00:02:18.340> finish<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.000> has<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.329> a<00:02:19.420> nice<00:02:19.600> kind<00:02:20.590> of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
matte finish it has like a nice kind of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.920 
matte finish it has like a nice kind of
like<00:02:20.890> Demi<00:02:21.250> matte<00:02:21.549> finish<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.630> know<00:02:22.750> what<00:02:22.870> I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
like Demi matte finish you know what I

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.470

mean<00:02:23.079> so<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:24.010> really<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:25.060> coverage

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
mean so I really like that the coverage

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.360 
mean so I really like that the coverage
is<00:02:25.840> amazing<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.470> love<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.040> way<00:02:27.190> this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
is amazing I love the way this

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.819 
is amazing I love the way this
foundation<00:02:27.880> feels<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.540> has<00:02:29.049> medium<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.680> full

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
foundation feels it has medium to full

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.130 
foundation feels it has medium to full
coverage<00:02:29.860> but<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.700> buildable<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.450> it's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
coverage but it is buildable but it's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.100 
coverage but it is buildable but it's
more<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> bit<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.049> a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
more on the like it is a bit of a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.810 
more on the like it is a bit of a
thicker<00:02:35.380> foundation<00:02:36.010> but<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> doesn't<00:02:36.670> feel

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
thicker foundation but it doesn't feel

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.819 
thicker foundation but it doesn't feel
heavy<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.810> would<00:02:38.019> say<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.350> more<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.799> the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
heavy so I would say it's more on the

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.060 
heavy so I would say it's more on the
fuller<00:02:39.610> coverage<00:02:39.970> side<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.680> could<00:02:41.860> still

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
fuller coverage side but you could still

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.500 
fuller coverage side but you could still
sheer<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.489> out<00:02:42.579> like<00:02:42.790> depending<00:02:43.180> on<00:02:43.269> how<00:02:43.390> much

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
sheer it out like depending on how much

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.259 
sheer it out like depending on how much
you<00:02:43.660> put<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:43.840> your<00:02:44.019> face<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.380> stuff<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.640> just

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
you put on your face and stuff so I just

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.789 
you put on your face and stuff so I just
really<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:46.959> far<00:02:47.140> as<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.320> packaging

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
really like it as far as the packaging

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.100 
really like it as far as the packaging
goes<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.250> has<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.489> pump<00:02:48.820> which<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.660> awesome

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
goes it has a pump which is awesome

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.300 
goes it has a pump which is awesome
because<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.380> could<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.650> pump<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.950> off<00:02:51.100> and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
because you could just pump it off and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.009 
because you could just pump it off and
you<00:02:51.370> literally<00:02:51.669> just<00:02:51.820> need<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> teeny<00:02:52.660> bit<00:02:52.900> of

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
you literally just need a teeny bit of

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.270 
you literally just need a teeny bit of
the<00:02:53.109> stuff<00:02:53.350> because<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.560> little<00:02:53.739> goes<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.040> long

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the stuff because a little goes a long

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.020 
the stuff because a little goes a long
way<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:55.449> yeah<00:02:56.199> there's<00:02:56.440> nothing

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
way but yeah there's nothing

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.640
