00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
shearing back you're going to get a lot

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.139 
shearing back you're going to get a lot
more<00:00:59.379> bud<00:00:59.770> set<00:01:00.070> than<00:01:00.370> if<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:00.550> just<00:01:00.579> let<00:01:00.940> them

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
more bud set than if you just let them

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.079 
more bud set than if you just let them
go<00:01:01.359> what<00:01:02.050> buds<00:01:02.320> mean<00:01:02.649> we're<00:01:03.129> pushing<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.550> okay

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
go what buds mean we're pushing it okay

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.800 
go what buds mean we're pushing it okay
this<00:01:04.390> is<00:01:04.770> June<00:01:05.770> eleventh<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.880> reason

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
this is June eleventh and the reason

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.480 
this is June eleventh and the reason
we're<00:01:07.930> doing<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.289> now<00:01:08.470> is<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.890> new<00:01:09.039> growth<00:01:09.280> is

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
we're doing it now is the new growth is

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.999 
we're doing it now is the new growth is
not<00:01:09.640> fully<00:01:10.030> set<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:10.780> when<00:01:11.349> we<00:01:11.470> trim<00:01:11.709> it<00:01:11.740> back<00:01:11.979> a

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
not fully set and when we trim it back a

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.820 
not fully set and when we trim it back a
little<00:01:12.130> bit<00:01:12.369> a<00:01:12.490> new<00:01:12.729> bud<00:01:12.940> growth<00:01:13.240> will<00:01:13.509> occur

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
little bit a new bud growth will occur

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.300 
little bit a new bud growth will occur
that's<00:01:14.830> correct

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
that's correct

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.760 
that's correct
we'll<00:01:16.179> get<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.300> lot<00:01:16.450> more<00:01:16.479> Fudd<00:01:16.840> grade<00:01:17.050> same<00:01:17.619> way

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
we'll get a lot more Fudd grade same way

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.770 
we'll get a lot more Fudd grade same way
on<00:01:17.920> your<00:01:18.039> tops<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:19.090> want<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.330> make<00:01:19.450> sure<00:01:19.479> that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
on your tops you want to make sure that

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.410 
on your tops you want to make sure that
when<00:01:19.929> you<00:01:20.020> cut<00:01:20.229> these<00:01:20.380> lateral<00:01:21.310> branches<00:01:21.789> at

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
when you cut these lateral branches at

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.969 
when you cut these lateral branches at
least<00:01:22.810> see<00:01:22.959> where<00:01:23.110> one<00:01:23.289> or<00:01:23.319> two<00:01:23.530> buds<00:01:23.830> are

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
least see where one or two buds are

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.499 
least see where one or two buds are
formed<00:01:24.340> when<00:01:24.670> we<00:01:24.880> make<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.149> cut<00:01:25.360> they'll

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
formed when we make the cut they'll

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.150 
formed when we make the cut they'll
probably<00:01:25.750> go<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.050> four<00:01:26.289> more<00:01:26.440> buds<00:01:26.740> but<00:01:27.009> just

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
probably go to four more buds but just

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.839 
probably go to four more buds but just
be<00:01:27.340> sure

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:27.849 
be sure

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:30.389 
be sure
just<00:01:28.660> look<00:01:28.810> for<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.990> little<00:01:29.229> brown<00:01:29.770> spot<00:01:30.220> in

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
just look for a little brown spot in

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.120 
just look for a little brown spot in
there<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:30.880> think<00:01:30.910> we're<00:01:31.209> buds<00:01:31.479> at<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
there that you think we're buds at and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.919 
there that you think we're buds at and
you'll<00:01:33.819> cut<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.149> back<00:01:34.360> here<00:01:34.660> we're<00:01:34.750> going<00:01:34.840> to

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
you'll cut that back here we're going to

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.960 
you'll cut that back here we're going to
take<00:01:35.080> off<00:01:35.259> about<00:01:35.410> half<00:01:35.800> otherwise<00:01:36.759> we're

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
take off about half otherwise we're

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.130 
take off about half otherwise we're
going<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.149> end<00:01:37.209> up<00:01:37.390> with<00:01:37.539> too<00:01:37.660> much<00:01:37.840> space

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
going to end up with too much space

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.529
