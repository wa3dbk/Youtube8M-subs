over the top of it using some powder
foundation<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.300> don't<00:01:34.480> use<00:01:34.750> too<00:01:34.990> much<00:01:35.020> of

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
foundation you don't use too much of

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.100 
foundation you don't use too much of
this<00:01:35.610> bang<00:01:36.610> out<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.180> most<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.720> back<00:01:37.900> into

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
this bang out and most of it back into

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.010 
this bang out and most of it back into
the<00:01:38.290> job<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.190> just<00:01:39.220> lightly<00:01:40.120> dot<00:01:40.630> over<00:01:40.900> the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
places where the fallout still is that
