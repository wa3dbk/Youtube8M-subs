really flat for some reason I don't know

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.780 
really flat for some reason I don't know
why<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.540> think<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.050> looks<00:02:47.290> better<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.950> did

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790

wear<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.209> curled<00:02:49.810> up<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.380> other<00:02:50.560> day<00:02:50.680> though

and<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.820> was<00:02:51.940> still<00:02:52.180> really<00:02:52.420> really<00:02:52.750> cute<00:02:53.430> so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
and it was still really really cute so

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.400 
and it was still really really cute so
it<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:55.030> depends<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.540> what<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410
