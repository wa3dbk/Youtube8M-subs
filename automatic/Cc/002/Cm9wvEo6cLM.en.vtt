00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.060 

so<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:00.989> thought<00:00:01.230> I'd<00:00:01.380> do<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> little<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.860> on

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so I thought I'd do a little video on

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.059 
so I thought I'd do a little video on
what<00:00:02.310> makes<00:00:02.520> these<00:00:02.870> kerosene<00:00:03.870> heaters<00:00:04.560> tick

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
what makes these kerosene heaters tick

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.169 
what makes these kerosene heaters tick
and<00:00:05.930> why<00:00:06.930> they<00:00:07.140> sometimes<00:00:07.529> don't<00:00:08.099> well<00:00:08.910> first

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
and why they sometimes don't well first

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.810 
and why they sometimes don't well first
thing<00:00:10.580> sticks<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.820> yourself<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> little<00:00:12.360> top<00:00:12.660> on

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
thing sticks to yourself a little top on

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
thing sticks to yourself a little top on
and<00:00:14.839> here<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.820> see<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> innards<00:00:18.560> you<00:00:19.560> got

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
and here you can see the innards you got

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.689 
and here you can see the innards you got
a<00:00:19.710> motor<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> fan<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:22.130> one<00:00:23.130> side<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.609> an

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
a motor with a fan and one side and an

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.179 
a motor with a fan and one side and an
air<00:00:23.939> pump<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.720> other<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:25.949> right

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
air pump on the other and then right

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
air pump on the other and then right
here<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.550> basically<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> modified<00:00:27.779> car

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
here you have basically a modified car

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.529 
here you have basically a modified car
spark<00:00:28.680> plug<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.279> igniter<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.939> then<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
spark plug is the igniter and then the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.069 
spark plug is the igniter and then the
nozzle<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> burners<00:00:31.949> inside<00:00:32.460> there<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
nozzle for the burners inside there and

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.340 
nozzle for the burners inside there and
how<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> works<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.850> pulls<00:00:36.210> air<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.719> through

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
how it works is it pulls air in through

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.869 
how it works is it pulls air in through
the<00:00:37.500> filter<00:00:38.160> back<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.700> there's<00:00:38.820> another

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the filter back here and there's another

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.139 
the filter back here and there's another
filter<00:00:39.540> inside<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.520> it<00:00:41.520> pushes<00:00:41.790> air

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
filter inside of here and it pushes air

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.630 
filter inside of here and it pushes air
through<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.690> hose<00:00:42.930> down<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.399> comes

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
through this hose down and then it comes

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.290 
through this hose down and then it comes
up<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.719> uses<00:00:45.960> air<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:47.430> pull<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> fuel<00:00:48.059> up

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
up and it uses air to pull the fuel up

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360 
up and it uses air to pull the fuel up
through<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.020> orifice<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.649> atomized<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
through the orifice and atomized the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.619 
through the orifice and atomized the
fuel<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.510> sometimes<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:53.239> they'll<00:00:54.239> they

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
fuel so sometimes like they'll they

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.869 
fuel so sometimes like they'll they
won't<00:00:54.809> want<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> start<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:55.890> won't<00:00:56.100> it'll

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
won't want to start and they won't it'll

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.790 
won't want to start and they won't it'll
seem<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.059> an<00:00:57.300> igniter<00:00:57.629> problem<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.590> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
seem like an igniter problem which is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.260 
seem like an igniter problem which is
what<00:00:59.039> somebody<00:00:59.399> thought<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.910> wrong<00:01:00.120> with

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
what somebody thought was wrong with

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.889 
what somebody thought was wrong with
this<00:01:00.420> one

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
this one

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.260 
this one
and<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.260> ended<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.859> their<00:01:02.039> garage<00:01:02.280> sale<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and it ended up at their garage sale so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
and it ended up at their garage sale so
they<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:03.780> replace<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> spark<00:01:04.680> plug

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
they can see they replace the spark plug

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.560 
they can see they replace the spark plug
in<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> still<00:01:05.790> didn't<00:01:06.090> work<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.479> they

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
in it and it still didn't work and they

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740 
in it and it still didn't work and they
said<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.930> had<00:01:07.290> igniter<00:01:07.650> problems<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:09.240> that's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
said it had igniter problems well that's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
said it had igniter problems well that's
not<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> case<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.650> igniter<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.130> fine<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
not the case the igniter is fine the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.570 
not the case the igniter is fine the
issue<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.140> filter<00:01:13.560> back<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> filter

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
issue is the filter back here the filter

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.359 
issue is the filter back here the filter
plugs<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> can't<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.070> enough

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
plugs up and then it can't get enough

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.390 
plugs up and then it can't get enough
airflow<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.659> atomize<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.439> fuel<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> that's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
airflow to atomize the fuel and that's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.160 
airflow to atomize the fuel and that's
why<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.729> won't<00:01:20.880> ignite<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:21.990> there's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
why they won't ignite is because there's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
why they won't ignite is because there's
not<00:01:22.350> enough<00:01:22.590> airflow<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.340> fuel<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.090> igniter

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
not enough airflow not fuel or igniter

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.800 
not enough airflow not fuel or igniter
issue<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.979> also<00:01:26.640> there's<00:01:27.299> four<00:01:27.509> screws

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
issue and then also there's four screws

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.899 
issue and then also there's four screws
that<00:01:27.930> hold<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.259> cover<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.670> here

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that hold this cover on and in here

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.030 
that hold this cover on and in here
there's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> fuel<00:01:30.420> filter<00:01:30.799> with<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
there's a fuel filter with the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940 
there's a fuel filter with the
electronics<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.299> once<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.259> year<00:01:34.290> according<00:01:34.770> to

and there's this foam filter here and
another<00:01:50.610> filter<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.299> goes<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.350> already

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
another filter that goes there I already

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590 
another filter that goes there I already
pulled<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.040> open<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.579> planar<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.299> what

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
pulled it open I was planar on what

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.690 
pulled it open I was planar on what
that's<00:01:55.530> oh<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.159> why<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> didn't

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that's oh I know that's why I didn't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.899 
that's oh I know that's why I didn't
work

one that plugs up this filter goes in on
this<00:02:07.680> side<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.220> there's<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> little

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
this side and then there's a little

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.059 
this side and then there's a little
square<00:02:09.239> piece<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.979> foam<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:13.500> filter<00:02:14.040> right

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
square piece of foam this filter right

here<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.810> fits<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.349> there<00:02:16.590> too<00:02:17.660> great<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.840> top

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
here that fits in there too great on top

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.059 
here that fits in there too great on top
of<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.370> exit<00:02:21.180> opening<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:25.590> a

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
of the exit opening that but that's a

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.979 
of the exit opening that but that's a
little<00:02:26.700> bit<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.180> makes<00:02:27.420> them<00:02:27.630> tick<00:02:27.810> and

little bit of what makes them tick and
why<00:02:28.739> they<00:02:28.920> don't<00:02:29.040> work<00:02:29.310> sometimes<00:02:33.769> yes<00:02:34.769> that

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
why they don't work sometimes yes that

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.830 
why they don't work sometimes yes that
little<00:02:35.430> square<00:02:35.730> filter<00:02:36.120> goes<00:02:36.330> right<00:02:36.569> in<00:02:36.720> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
little square filter goes right in the

little square filter goes right in the
side<00:02:37.110> not<00:02:37.319> on<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.620> side<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.130> then<00:02:38.310> this

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
side not on that side but then this

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.780 
side not on that side but then this
filter<00:02:38.970> sits<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.110> top<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.069> hole<00:02:41.370> is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
filter sits on top of it so this hole is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.729

foam and lamp screw holes and then this

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.039 
foam and lamp screw holes and then this
hole<00:02:47.220> lines<00:02:47.640> up<00:02:47.849> with<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.269> whole<00:02:48.480> layer<00:02:48.780> this
