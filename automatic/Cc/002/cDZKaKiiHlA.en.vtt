00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and it actually works surprisingly but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.410 
and it actually works surprisingly but
it<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.950> quite<00:01:14.310> difficult<00:01:14.610> especially<00:01:15.090> if

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
it can be quite difficult especially if

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030
