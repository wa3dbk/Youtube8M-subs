00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.430 
problem I see is that the battery life
is<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.220> bit<00:01:29.400> less<00:01:30.110> then<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.260> would<00:01:31.410> be

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
is a little bit less then it would be

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.400 
is a little bit less then it would be
with<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.860> stock<00:01:32.220> operating<00:01:33.030> system<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.020> the
