 we are going to put on fidel high on 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600
 fibroface 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.780
 wrinkle well is not a block is the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 napkin well pretty well what 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.619
 have the girls those thrown not how much 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.650
 more untidy and ugly, it's cuter 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.869
 the leather is left without then we put a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.100
 little fixer to below and then 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.820
 fixer up crushing without 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.910
 squashing well with the brush eta for 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 let's see what's left armadito you 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.619
 will you be here and then see what 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.770
 we do this it is already dry I what 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.500
 start a design like here is armed 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.390
 there what I did in the design and then 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.860
 we started painting with here what 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.680
 we have acrylic 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.610
 what we have to do 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.670
 is to paint with crossed strokes because 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.720
 when painting so clear meditate then 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.890
 we can high and low reliefs 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 moistened well starts cities 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.250
 glassy and that helps a lot 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.709
 then I thought we were all and then 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.680
 we have it assigned sometimes here we have 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.819
 a black and here we have in ocher that was 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.990
 the touches of the sun in ica 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.470
 after that what we have to do 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:46.040
 on the black we give a black varnish 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.829
 water-based varnish and water-based varnish 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.530
 it has to be black it has to be black 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.340
 the black on black on ocher him 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.379
 let's give a light oak 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.440
 if one can play equally with the 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.200
 colors in the black would be in the black 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.480
 but on the light oak on what 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.700
 out there playing with other colors 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.990
 if then we give all we have left 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.930
 so if later on he believes 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.350
 What I gave him was the double varnish 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350
 Clear 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.100
 and it looks clear, it 's good that 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.740
 those 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.740
 do not retreat here if I refer 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.740
 moistened 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:44.530
 waters and doll and retreat where I want 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.959
 like if you see that excess that 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.010
 it stays there is good times later what 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.280
 it stays like this 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.139
 then what we can do is with 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.139
 our point and a little wax 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.880
 because third for floors or smoked is a 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.850
 they all go well according to the time it's good 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.370
 dry to do well the imitation of 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.370
 leather is to hit with wax 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.110
 everything we let him dream and then 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.630
 we get reason not to continue to 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.030
 finalize what we do 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.739
 I have some rods here 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.739
 so they're like this unpainted 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.219
 and is alone paint with light oak in 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.960
 we painted it with a neighborhood marino if 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:36.990
 we have to thank you to see that it is 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.370
 a student of my workshop that thanks to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.860
 she did what she did with varnish 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.900
 marine time that what they opened and so 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.930
 it would be in brilliant can not play 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.550
 as you want later with cement 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.430
 without with a glue of hills with 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.680
 we all hit it and put together the design 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.900
 the turn and look to see we go to the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.790
 return and others say that good and others 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.740
 colors 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.930
 and what can be also that this 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.230
 recycling is good for you fijate 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.440
 this is a shoe box 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:11.710
 awesome it looked like empty dam and it's 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.600
 a cardboard shoe box and it's like 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.849
 it also works like a letter sucks 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.669
 because the arch 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.529
 it's great bridge good good pleasure 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.839
