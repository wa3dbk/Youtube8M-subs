00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.680
 a year and a half. the fascinating story that the gsc boys leave chernobyl 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.629
 diamond take us back to the area making us do it 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.080
 A jump into the past 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.960
 shortly before the events narrated in the first episode we find ourselves again 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.790
 in the role of a stolker 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.860
 a decidedly troubled period 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.089
 so many missions devastate the area making it militia neutral beforehand 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.540
 and opening others completely new 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.150
 period of this stability genovia mind conflicts between the factions present on 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.540
 and which creates a perfect for ground for the key element of this p 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.600
 a constant war situation 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 it is total freedom of choice on which to support until victory 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.850
 our journey will begin immediately after a strong emission that will exterminate 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.000
 all our company except us 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.920
 attempt to understand the motives of our community. so devastating 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.860
 phenomena their nature 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.280
 we will begin to work because the askari is a faction that has as its objective 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 primary study of the area of ​​its peculiarities 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.830
 then first steps into the new swamp area familiarize again 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:25.620
 with anomaly 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.210
 concentration of energy due to the massive radiation of the territory 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.520
 which often conceal mysterious artifacts of great value 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.650
 in the area 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.070
 instead it manifests as the first episode for lp this is presented 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.570
 invisible and mobile 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.510
 for a suggestion to track it, a detector will be present 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.420
 the technique of collecting artifacts and therefore much more complex than 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.370
 how we remembered it and I began to feel frustrated 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.440
 repeated failed attempts 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.310
 if it is true that in the first episode finds rothrock videos too 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.999
 easy 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.450
 it seems that the developers have exaggerated a little how to make it 

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:58.930
 harder 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.650
 apart from this substantial link difference she has remained practically 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.970
 unchanged 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.370
 we are once again faced with a shooter with some gdr elements 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.060
 that the presence of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.709
 inventory and statistics for acts and armor all applicable through 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.259
 purchase rewards and multiple choice avenues 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.229
 we also find the handheld that provides us with a real-time map of the 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.800
 area 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.049
 personal statistics 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.009
 and a new section dedicated to the war between factions 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.969
 as far as the freedom of choice on where to go once the first is completed 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:26.310
 short 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.549
 mission is assumed 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.719
 once again the only one 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.680
 true way to proceed actually address the main missions that you 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.029
 presents the lens after lens absolutely linear 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.579
 in this sense the concept of persistent war introduced this danger 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.029
 proves to be much less effective than expected 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.229
 'accomplices' an inwind management and clashes modifying the little supported venue 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.659
 from the port that will lead the player to have the impression of joining some 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.279
 Shooting casualties of a global conflict the result fails 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:56.129
 capture the attention to be given to the reasons to be addressed there are 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.999
 just spawned a few strategic points to conquer but no real sense of 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.229
 vittorio 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.489
 they look at the actual firefights they are still characterized 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.980
 once you give me extremely realistic how effects and black is stable 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.099
 and from bleeding keandra promptly stopped with egrets 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.679
 it was a slow death 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.449
 perugia discrete routines and he has enemies the possibility has been added 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.159
 to throw grenades 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.629
 unfortunately it often does not add to the trouble but only frustration 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.230
 grenades that will in fact come from everywhere and continuously forcing recourse 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.819
 rescue lifeguards fight 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.139
 as far as the alienating mazara atmosphere of the valley is concerned 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.079
 some game play choices leave us decidedly perplexed 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.189
 we think for example of the occasional rapids from here we will be victims on the side 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.990
 of bandits 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.019
 pc2 will be inventory without us being able to do anything about it 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.290
 if we add to this the impossibility of recovering the objects also kill 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.859
 the others 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.459
 the two general difficulties in accumulating money due to the scarcity of artifacts 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.119
 resulting ecuador is still time. frequently frustrated 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:53.949
 villa del desaine once again characterized by beautiful spaces 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:58.009
 open decaying desolate chrome plating reproduced with exceptional craftsmanship 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.999
 compared to the first stolker there is a drastic reduction in levels 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.819
 set in the subsoil that although few remain terrifying 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.959
 beautiful 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.949
 the technical sector sees significant improvements in terms of detectors 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.599
 which sports lighting system that between wise use of hdr la 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.430
 sclera takes magical sunrises and sunsets and suggestive that it is the rays of 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.019
 sun among the vegetation 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.239
 however the engine remains the same as the first episode how to disinfect 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.069
 genetics 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.050
 regardless of the power of the test machine it proves itself 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.909
 very heavy and logistics 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.089
 despite the defects and partially failed attempts to enlarge 

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.380
 the horizon of the Templars 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.439
 pierre scary man heir to the first chapter 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.900
 fish still create a unique atmosphere with a sense of anguish and paranoia 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:37.990
 persistent 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.599
 identification that arises from it tends to make us forget defects and merits of 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:42.530
 graphic engine 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.050
 leaving room only for a strong desire for exploration discoveries 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.720
 all this is adoptable present in the predecessor 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.120
 and where I came up I failed to enrich the formula 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.139
 whereas the game mechanics is partially ruined 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.220
 artifice voice from a very poor gratification attainment of the 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.259
 targets 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.449
 the buying advice therefore applies to all those nostalgic for the first episode 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.819
 which translated away to be disappointed by the controversial novelty 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.599
 those who have not yet ascertained with the search area are atypical fps and 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:10.490
 charming 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.110
 should instead approach the site and then maybe recover the first unreachable 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.479
 historic shado chernobyl
