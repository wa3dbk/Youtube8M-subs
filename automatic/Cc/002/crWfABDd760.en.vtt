00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.150
 good day from the roster of all lovers 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.400
 disassemble and twist myself i'm not 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.049
 I recommend you do it better 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.109
 contact official service 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 Well if you decide that it can 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.000
 begin with a disassembly overview 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 new engine 1 and 4 thousand a and we 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.359
 represents golf 6 plus 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 on his example, I will show you a brief 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.989
 instruction means if you are still 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.530
 decided to do it yourself then you 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.309
 I will say that you run into a very 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:47.190
 significant difficulties 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.649
 since the head is not detached so 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.379
 it just needs to be done by 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.920
 many manipulations and so mean after 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.940
 separation of all unnecessary parts for us 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.730
 if it can be seen, it means such connections 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.770
 suction manifold and everything else 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.920
 proceed to disassembly means clean 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 top cover and see underneath 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.970
 valve cover means valve cover 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.810
 does not disconnect until disconnected 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:31.970
 side cover protecting chain and rollers 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.600
 it means you can unscrew it only if you 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.500
 previously 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.220
 unscrew all the necessary elements in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.790
 I recommend you to start with 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.020
 pulley 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 so 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:55.229
 it means you need the first thing you need 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 make it start 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:06.890
 oddly enough all the same down below so we 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.890
 moving down the car 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:21.730
 so here we see the pallet is what 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.360
 will need to start our means 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.740
 skinny first will need to be removed 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.110
 great specialists who do not want 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.200
 do this and unscrew the pallet can 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.520
 try to remove the cover yourself 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.370
 screwdrivers on both sides if it is not 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.980
 stuck there are necessary such bases 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.590
 Now I will show you here they are if you 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:51.560
 You can see from this side 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:55.610
 and from this side and safely cover 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.820
 Go away but for those who still do not 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.730
 can do and does not want to be afraid to break 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.390
 I still recommend you 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 unscrew the pallet here there is a little 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.770
 under the snag here there are two such toxic 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.550
 but if you see two mounting holes 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.470
 two bolts go to the box and inside 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.709
 I certainly will not show you these fastenings 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.370
 you are such holes deeply hidden 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.090
 two bolts that need to be unscrewed 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.950
 they keep the pallet long long 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.190
 hexagon without this you nothing 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:41.500
 do so suppose that we are all 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.500
 unscrew usually remove the pallet 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:04.070
 all pallets we have removed sorry that 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.740
 the camera here we see everything that us 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.310
 interests mean after we 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.810
 appreciated the pallet we can go over again 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:25.070
 to the top to detach the cover 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:26.440
 everything else and so here we are again 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.230
 we are on top 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.300
 after the pallet is disconnected we 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:38.810
 we can proceed 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:46.130
 detaching the protective cover to 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:48.140
 release the chain we unscrew for 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.950
 the problem is that this cover can 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.160
 appreciate not unscrewing the pallet but for 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.960
 this is necessary he sits very greasy 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.930
 on the pulley is very sitting and need 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.810
 try very hard to his 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:08.410
 tear off if it's glued so we 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.410
 disconnect the lid path 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:32.720
 here we have the cover removed here we 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.000
 see we can see means chain asterisks 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.620
 no longer here since i already took it off and 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.870
 here is for residents all shoot 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.890
 now you can access for 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:50.080
 order to change the circuit and all you 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:53.270
 necessary further everything happens just 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.840
 top cover I already told you that without 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:04.120
 these valve manipulations you will not remove 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:04.120
 then we remove the top cover 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:21.880
 Valve fall responsibly to valves 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.880
 Next, unscrew the bolts 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:46.150
 Here we unscrew and remove occurs 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:49.330
 head itself so we got access to 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.000
 the piston group can then produce 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.720
 all the manipulations that you want to all 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.720
 thank you all
