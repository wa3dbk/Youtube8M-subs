there<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.820> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.380> flat<00:01:49.380> hollow<00:01:50.369> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
there that kind of flat hollow that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
there that kind of flat hollow that
doesn't<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> pattern<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
doesn't really have a pattern to it but

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
doesn't really have a pattern to it but
it<00:01:52.649> still<00:01:52.829> looks<00:01:52.979> pretty<00:01:53.040> cool<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> there's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it still looks pretty cool so there's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.160 
it still looks pretty cool so there's
all<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.210> let<00:01:57.360> me<00:01:57.479> find<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
all of them and then let me find the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.310 
all of them and then let me find the
actual<00:01:58.290> sylveon<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
actual sylveon one that I think is a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.590 
actual sylveon one that I think is a
little<00:02:01.409> different<00:02:04.280> yep<00:02:05.280> alright<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.450> let's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
little different yep alright so let's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
little different yep alright so let's
just<00:02:06.780> kind<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.200> order<00:02:07.849> whatever<00:02:08.849> order

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
just kind of go in order whatever order

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.690 
just kind of go in order whatever order
they<00:02:09.209> put<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> then<00:02:10.489> sylveon<00:02:11.489> at<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
they put them in and then sylveon at the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.480 
they put them in and then sylveon at the
back<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.270> we

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
back so we

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.940 
back so we
have<00:02:13.710> move<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.920> camera<00:02:15.220> down<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.460> bit<00:02:15.790> we<00:02:16.030> have

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
have move the camera down a bit we have

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.470 
have move the camera down a bit we have
EV<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.700> looks<00:02:18.820> pretty<00:02:19.000> cool<00:02:19.120> what<00:02:19.240> actually

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
EV that looks pretty cool what actually

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.910 
EV that looks pretty cool what actually
does<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> pattern<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.380> actually<00:02:20.620> has

does have a pattern to it actually has

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.910 
does have a pattern to it actually has
this<00:02:21.190> kind<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.730> dotted<00:02:22.510> pattern<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.740> there's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
this kind of dotted pattern so there's

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.910 
this kind of dotted pattern so there's
an<00:02:24.070> EV<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.640> these<00:02:25.270> are<00:02:25.390> all<00:02:25.590> black<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.740> white

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
an EV and these are all black and white

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.310 
an EV and these are all black and white
promos<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.710> there's<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.830> Vaporeon<00:02:31.740> jolteon

energy its weak to metal and resistant
to<00:03:09.820> dark<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.360> that's<00:03:10.510> kind<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.720> interesting

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
to dark so that's kind of interesting

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.120 
to dark so that's kind of interesting
and<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.630> promo<00:03:13.630> number<00:03:15.000> X<00:03:16.000> Y<00:03:16.360> 04<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
and it is promo number X Y 04 so the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.270 
and it is promo number X Y 04 so the
first<00:03:18.400> three<00:03:18.730> are<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.800> starters<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.070> then<00:03:21.160> we

background for now as well and on top of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.270 
background for now as well and on top of
all<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.650> we<00:03:44.920> get<00:03:45.100> four<00:03:45.400> packs<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:46.890> we<00:03:47.890> get<00:03:48.070> two

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
all that we get four packs so we get two

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.490 
all that we get four packs so we get two
packs<00:03:48.550> of<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.090> new<00:03:49.240> set<00:03:49.540> legendary<00:03:50.110> treasures
