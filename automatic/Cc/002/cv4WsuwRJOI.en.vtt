 noble and roger probe ship 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 the project that started last year 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.369
 necessary is not because the human body

 hour there was no time to run away 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.790
 relatives and colleagues 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 profession sought explanations 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.079
 this woman of a welder who prefers 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.680
 not appear afraid of the lack of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.680
 safety 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:03.390
 the van was the fire department and the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.339
 captain of the ports were 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.439
 committed to searching the sea 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.900
 the workers occupied a scaffolding that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.479
 dragged during the accident to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.580
 rescue operation was only closed 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.650
 after almost five hours 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.560
 the police station of angra dos reis 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.080
 will also ascertain the case the area has passed 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.950
 isolated for inspection of technicians and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 engineers 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.210
 the support beams let 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.119
 dark-colored counterweight 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.860
 stern were cut with torches in the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.040
 initial planning a crane 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.020
 should support be part of 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.930
 the vessel does not run the risk of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.090
 because it occupies a dry spot and knows 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.649
 that in these Greek companies times 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.159
 happens 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.380
 lack of security have cipa but to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.329
 sometimes it is official but in the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.240
 truth sometimes does not work like 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.280
 the company should sometimes work in a 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.200
 universe in the cipa 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.240
 the report that will point out the causes of 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.140
 failure will have the result disclosed in 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.119
 maximum one month 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.070

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.990
 testimony in the next days 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.599
 one of them remains hospitalized with 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.030
 severe injury to one leg 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.380
 I have no doubt that there was a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
 fatality or vice 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.320
 there was some procedure that we skipped right 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 and there during the investigation the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.940
 customer will be seeing what has gone 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.010
 really what happened to us has 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.260
 there as unfortunately as experience 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.810
 so that it does not happen and other 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.840
 activities there it is our day to 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.840
 day
