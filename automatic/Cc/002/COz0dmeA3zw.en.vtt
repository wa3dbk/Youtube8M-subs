if you do have a mage and its tax and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.770 
if you do have a mage and its tax and
I'd<00:00:53.190> recommend<00:00:53.520> using<00:00:53.879> searing<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:54.570> because

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.350

it<00:00:54.809> does<00:00:54.989> damage<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.430> fire<00:00:56.850> element<00:00:57.239> or

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it does damage and then fire element or

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.709 
it does damage and then fire element or
on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.199> hero<00:00:58.410> phase<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:58.949> something<00:00:58.980> about

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
on the hero phase or something about

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.500 
on the hero phase or something about
healing<00:01:00.719> string<00:01:01.199> totem<00:01:02.059> fading<00:01:03.059> obviously
