00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
exceptional you know it was an

adjustment<00:00:34.480> for<00:00:34.660> him<00:00:34.870> initially<00:00:35.170> but<00:00:36.130> he's

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
adjustment for him initially but he's

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.520 
adjustment for him initially but he's
taking<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:36.790> really<00:00:36.970> well<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.480> played<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.500> well

taking it really well and played so well
that<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.100> think<00:00:39.430> he's<00:00:39.610> now<00:00:39.879> you<00:00:40.239> know<00:00:40.410> respected

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
that I think he's now you know respected

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.570 
that I think he's now you know respected
around<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.770> league<00:00:41.950> he's<00:00:42.129> one<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.430> top

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
around the league he's one of the top

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.790 
around the league he's one of the top
center<00:00:42.820> backs<00:00:43.090> I<00:00:43.420> mean<00:00:43.780> he's<00:00:43.960> very<00:00:44.590> good

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
center backs I mean he's very good

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.950 
center backs I mean he's very good
technically<00:00:45.190> you<00:00:46.000> know<00:00:46.090> he<00:00:46.239> works<00:00:46.450> hard<00:00:46.690> and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
technically you know he works hard and

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.990 
technically you know he works hard and
think<00:00:47.920> he<00:00:48.010> reads<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.340> game<00:00:48.550> really<00:00:48.760> well<00:00:48.850> you

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
think he reads the game really well you

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.430 
think he reads the game really well you
know<00:00:49.210> they've<00:00:49.330> always<00:00:49.390> played<00:00:49.720> d<00:00:49.930> mid<00:00:50.170> and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
know they've always played d mid and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.500 
know they've always played d mid and
he's<00:00:50.890> come<00:00:51.070> into<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.640> situation<00:00:51.970> this<00:00:52.330> year

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
he's come into a situation this year

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.360 
he's come into a situation this year
where<00:00:52.660> they<00:00:52.750> put<00:00:53.379> him<00:00:53.500> out<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.710> position<00:00:53.830> and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
where they put him out of position and

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.729 
where they put him out of position and
he<00:00:55.300> still<00:00:55.540> see<00:00:55.720> you<00:00:55.809> know<00:00:55.930> how<00:00:56.080> well<00:00:56.320> he<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.559> and

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
he still see you know how well he is and

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.720 
he still see you know how well he is and
I<00:00:56.800> think<00:00:57.070> he's<00:00:57.339> one<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.610> best

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
I think he's one of the best

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.009 
I think he's one of the best
centre-backs<00:00:58.030> even<00:00:58.570> though<00:00:58.659> he's<00:00:58.780> playing

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
centre-backs even though he's playing

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.770 
centre-backs even though he's playing
out<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.199> position<00:00:59.290> as<00:01:00.159> a<00:01:00.220> defender<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:00.729> think<00:01:01.120> he

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
out of position as a defender I think he

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.450 
out of position as a defender I think he
would<00:01:02.260> very<00:01:02.530> weird<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:02.949> game<00:01:03.129> you<00:01:03.280> know<00:01:03.430> II

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
would very weird the game you know II

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.910 
would very weird the game you know II
you<00:01:04.000> know<00:01:04.030> exactly<00:01:04.629> where<00:01:04.839> he<00:01:04.960> can<00:01:05.140> anticipate

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
you know exactly where he can anticipate

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.860 
you know exactly where he can anticipate
you<00:01:06.580> know<00:01:06.729> there's<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.060> board<00:01:07.300> from<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.479> fog

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
you know there's a board from the fog

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.540 
you know there's a board from the fog
well<00:01:08.050> the<00:01:08.260> anticipated<00:01:08.950> passed<00:01:09.159> on<00:01:09.310> him<00:01:09.430> is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
well the anticipated passed on him is

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.920 
well the anticipated passed on him is
really<00:01:09.790> going<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.120> follow<00:01:10.360> up<00:01:10.479> because<00:01:10.630> I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
really going to a follow up because I

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.380 
really going to a follow up because I
think<00:01:11.170> he<00:01:11.920> has<00:01:12.159> a<00:01:12.220> midfielder<00:01:12.790> he<00:01:13.000> know<00:01:13.180> what

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
think he has a midfielder he know what

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.210 
think he has a midfielder he know what
type<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.600> borders<00:01:14.110> meet<00:01:14.350> with<00:01:14.500> all<00:01:14.680> look<00:01:14.979> to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
type of borders meet with all look to

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.730 
type of borders meet with all look to
play<00:01:15.430> as<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.790> forward<00:01:16.299> so<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:16.780> think<00:01:17.170> knowing

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
play as a forward so I think knowing

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.670 
play as a forward so I think knowing
that<00:01:17.979> he<00:01:18.190> always<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.900> know<00:01:20.020> anticipate

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
that he always a you know anticipate

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.520 
that he always a you know anticipate
where<00:01:20.979> he<00:01:21.159> knows<00:01:21.450> there's<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.540> pass<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.020> and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
where he knows there's a pass and and

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.230 
where he knows there's a pass and and
get<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.190> front<00:01:24.400> for<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.700> while<00:01:24.880> but<00:01:25.060> he's

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
get it in a front for a while but he's

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.630 
get it in a front for a while but he's
very<00:01:25.299> good<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.690> in<00:01:25.960> 1d<00:01:26.590> one<00:01:26.740> defender<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.490> was

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
very good to in 1d one defender it was

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.819 
very good to in 1d one defender it was
very<00:01:27.850> hard<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:28.810> go<00:01:29.049> around<00:01:29.409> him<00:01:29.680> because

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
very hard to to go around him because

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.740 
very hard to to go around him because
it's<00:01:30.130> very<00:01:30.280> no<00:01:30.610> strong<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.299> protects<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
it's very no strong and protects the

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.139 
it's very no strong and protects the
bowler<00:01:32.020> super<00:01:32.680> very<00:01:33.009> well<00:01:33.219> I'm<00:01:33.579> always<00:01:33.789> been
