draw<00:03:14.060> around<00:03:14.299> regions<00:03:15.079> so<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.319> just<00:03:15.560> tap<00:03:15.829> on

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
draw around regions so you just tap on

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.979 
draw around regions so you just tap on
there<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.879> we're<00:03:17.030> going<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.269> pinch<00:03:17.659> and<00:03:17.930> zoom

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
there so we're going to pinch and zoom

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.280 
there so we're going to pinch and zoom
in<00:03:18.379> on<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.250> clock<00:03:19.609> what<00:03:20.419> we<00:03:20.540> want<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.109> we<00:03:21.260> want

what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.640 
what we're going to do is we're going to
pin<00:03:27.079> or<00:03:27.349> touch<00:03:27.849> hold<00:03:28.849> and<00:03:29.349> we're<00:03:30.349> going<00:03:30.620> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
pin or touch hold and we're going to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.050 
pin or touch hold and we're going to
mask<00:03:31.129> out<00:03:32.650> those<00:03:33.650> numbers<00:03:34.129> right<00:03:34.340> there<00:03:34.609> those

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
mask out those numbers right there those

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.699 
mask out those numbers right there those
are<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.329> ones<00:03:35.510> we<00:03:35.690> want<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.139> movements<00:03:36.590> so

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
are the ones we want in movements so

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.559 
are the ones we want in movements so
we're<00:03:36.829> going<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.129> zoom<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.669> a<00:03:37.760> little<00:03:37.849> bit<00:03:38.000> more

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
if I turn that off now it's just going

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.469 
if I turn that off now it's just going
to<00:04:39.770> count<00:04:39.949> forward<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.550> just<00:04:40.759> reset<00:04:41.180> itself

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
to count forward and just reset itself

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.490 
to count forward and just reset itself
back<00:04:41.840> in<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.169> three<00:04:42.469> second<00:04:43.069> clip<00:04:43.370> some<00:04:44.500> video

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.080 
back in the three second clip some video
you'll<00:04:45.710> shoot<00:04:45.979> it'll<00:04:46.310> work<00:04:46.460> better<00:04:46.699> with<00:04:46.969> the

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
you'll shoot it'll work better with the

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.879 
you'll shoot it'll work better with the
reverse<00:04:47.449> it'll<00:04:47.810> add<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:47.990> nice<00:04:48.319> fluid<00:04:48.620> motion

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
reverse it'll add a nice fluid motion

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.529 
reverse it'll add a nice fluid motion
those<00:04:49.219> ones<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.550> showed<00:04:49.729> you<00:04:49.849> with<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.120> sink<00:04:50.419> I

those ones I showed you with the sink I

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.600 
those ones I showed you with the sink I
have<00:04:50.689> it<00:04:50.840> on<00:04:50.900> reverse<00:04:51.289> it<00:04:52.189> keeps<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.580> very

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
have it on reverse it keeps it very
