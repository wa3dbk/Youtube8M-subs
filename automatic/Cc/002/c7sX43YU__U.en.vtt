okay<00:00:00.599> we're<00:00:00.750> over<00:00:00.870> here<00:00:01.110> at<00:00:01.170> tub<00:00:01.380> number<00:00:01.650> two

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
okay we're over here at tub number two

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.090 
okay we're over here at tub number two
where<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> install<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.540> PVC<00:00:04.200> type

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
where we're going to install a PVC type

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.700 
where we're going to install a PVC type
drainage<00:00:05.520> system<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.170> this<00:00:07.170> pipe<00:00:07.410> doesn't

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
drainage system and this pipe doesn't

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.200 
drainage system and this pipe doesn't
have<00:00:07.799> any<00:00:07.950> holes<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.519> can<00:00:08.670> buy<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> pipe

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
have any holes in it you can buy a pipe

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.570 
have any holes in it you can buy a pipe
that<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.230> perforated<00:00:10.800> because<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
that that is perforated because this is

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.089 
that that is perforated because this is
a<00:00:11.610> thin<00:00:12.240> walled<00:00:12.480> sewer<00:00:12.780> top<00:00:13.019> pipe<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
a thin walled sewer top pipe but the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.860 
a thin walled sewer top pipe but the
problem<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> thin<00:00:15.120> wall<00:00:15.330> sewer<00:00:15.599> pipe

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
problem is with the thin wall sewer pipe

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.269 
problem is with the thin wall sewer pipe
that<00:00:16.020> you'll<00:00:16.199> bind<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> have

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that you'll bind it's going to have

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.550 
that you'll bind it's going to have
holes<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.910> exactly<00:00:18.539> opposite<00:00:19.020> sides<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.439> each

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
holes on exactly opposite sides of each

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
holes on exactly opposite sides of each
other<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.980> we're<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> drill<00:00:21.240> like

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
other and we're not going to drill like

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
other and we're not going to drill like
that<00:00:21.660> we're<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> drill<00:00:22.380> our<00:00:22.560> holes<00:00:22.800> so

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
that we're going to drill our holes so

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.130 
that we're going to drill our holes so
that<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.910> water<00:00:24.180> holes<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that the the water holes are on the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:35.450 
that the the water holes are on the
bottom<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:30.000> pipe<00:00:33.530> but<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.710> 180<00:00:35.190> degrees

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
bottom of the pipe but not 180 degrees

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.010 
bottom of the pipe but not 180 degrees
to<00:00:35.640> each<00:00:35.700> other<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> drill<00:00:36.899> them

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
to each other we're going to drill them

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.910 
to each other we're going to drill them
so<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> they're<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:39.410> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.469> around<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
so that they're just kind of around the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.330 
so that they're just kind of around the
corner<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:41.399> each<00:00:41.579> other

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
corner from each other

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.850 
corner from each other
and<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.670> will<00:00:44.789> give<00:00:47.149> an<00:00:48.149> improved<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and it will give an improved way of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
and it will give an improved way of
getting<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> water<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:51.620> while<00:00:52.620> impeding<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
getting the water out while impeding the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.869 
getting the water out while impeding the
infiltration<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:54.030> dirt<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.550> many<00:00:56.550> things

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
infiltration of dirt and many things

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.439 
infiltration of dirt and many things
that<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.199> too<00:00:59.030> to<00:01:00.030> choke<00:01:00.270> up

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that will get in there too to choke up

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
that will get in there too to choke up
our<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:00.780> system<00:01:02.600> since<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:04.379> holes<00:01:04.710> are

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
our little system since these holes are

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.789 
our little system since these holes are
about<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.840> half-inch<00:01:06.840> diameter<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
about a half-inch diameter and this is a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.840 
about a half-inch diameter and this is a
speed<00:01:08.220> bore<00:01:09.890> it's<00:01:10.890> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.310> generic<00:01:11.580> name

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
speed bore it's kind of a generic name

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510 
speed bore it's kind of a generic name
that's<00:01:12.180> used<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> drill<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.250> our

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that's used for the drill bit it's our

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.160 
that's used for the drill bit it's our
flat<00:01:14.820> spade<00:01:15.210> bit<00:01:15.509> some<00:01:16.110> people<00:01:16.380> call<00:01:16.560> them

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
flat spade bit some people call them

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
flat spade bit some people call them
that<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.680> does<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> real<00:01:20.130> nice<00:01:20.310> job<00:01:20.580> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that you know does a real nice job of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730 
that you know does a real nice job of
drilling<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.930> see<00:01:22.110> how<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.320> drill

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
drilling it but you can see how we drill

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.090 
drilling it but you can see how we drill
primarily<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.090> side<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> pipe<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
primarily on one side of the pipe and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.840 
primarily on one side of the pipe and
there's<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.159> reason<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there's a reason for that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.600 
there's a reason for that
now<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> plug<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> ends<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
now we're going to plug the ends of this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.899 
now we're going to plug the ends of this
pipe<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.470> dirt<00:01:31.909> coming

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
pipe so that we don't have dirt coming

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.999 
pipe so that we don't have dirt coming
in<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> pipes<00:01:37.070> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.909> ends<00:01:39.860> we're<00:01:40.860> just

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
in to the pipes on the ends we're just

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.010 
in to the pipes on the ends we're just
going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> use<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> end<00:01:48.020> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
going to use a can to put in the end to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.330 
going to use a can to put in the end to
put<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> we're<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> hold<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.189> in

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
put it in and we're going to hold it in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
put it in and we're going to hold it in
place<00:01:52.280> with<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> little<00:01:53.610> piece<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> stick<00:01:54.180> we're

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
place with a little piece of stick we're

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.590 
place with a little piece of stick we're
going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.680> both<00:01:55.710> ends<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
going to do that on both ends of the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.810 
going to do that on both ends of the
pipe<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:59.119> provide<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.479> barrier<00:02:01.729> for<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
pipe to provide a barrier for the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.090 
pipe to provide a barrier for the
infiltration

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
infiltration

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.930 
infiltration
of<00:02:06.100> dirt<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:08.410> will<00:02:08.590> choke<00:02:08.860> up<00:02:09.039> our<00:02:09.250> drainage

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
of dirt that will choke up our drainage

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.780 
of dirt that will choke up our drainage
system<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:13.540> that
