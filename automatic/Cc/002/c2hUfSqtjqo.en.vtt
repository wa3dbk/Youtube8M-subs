hell of a lot faster than you he's
already<00:00:23.640> got<00:00:23.910> an<00:00:24.029> expansion<00:00:24.600> coming<00:00:24.840> out<00:00:26.240> you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
already got an expansion coming out you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
know I'm just I'm just now getting

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.220 
know I'm just I'm just now getting
around<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> building<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.539> bunch<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.810> Marines<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
around to building a bunch of Marines it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.659 
around to building a bunch of Marines it
could<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.500> probably<00:00:31.740> constructed<00:00:32.250> an

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
could have probably constructed an

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
could have probably constructed an
expansion<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:34.380> anticipating<00:00:34.710> an

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
expansion but I was anticipating an

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.810 
expansion but I was anticipating an
attack<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.700> come<00:00:35.910> from<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> surgeon<00:00:36.540> player

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
attack to come from the surgeon player

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
attack to come from the surgeon player
which<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.000> never<00:00:39.120> did<00:00:40.399> unfortunately<00:00:41.399> but

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
which it never did unfortunately but

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.540 
which it never did unfortunately but
even<00:00:42.450> though<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.660> didn't<00:00:42.960> win<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.469> round<00:00:43.770> if

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
even though I didn't win this round if

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
even though I didn't win this round if
it<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:44.910> been<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.570> me<00:00:45.870> against<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> Protoss

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it had been just me against the Protoss

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.410 
it had been just me against the Protoss
player<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> could<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:47.910> turned<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
player I could have actually turned it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.220 
player I could have actually turned it
around<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.360> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.660> interesting<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
around so it's kind of interesting to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
around so it's kind of interesting to
see<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.680> ends<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:52.980> happening<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.719> my

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
see what ends up happening here my

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.279 
see what ends up happening here my
opponents<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.710> lot<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> units<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.660> he's

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
opponents got a lot of units and he's

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.040 
opponents got a lot of units and he's
ready<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.129> kill<00:00:59.989> after<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
ready to go in for the kill after I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
ready to go in for the kill after I
think<00:01:01.260> he's<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> grab<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.160> couple<00:01:02.579> more

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
think he's going to grab a couple more

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
think he's going to grab a couple more
supplementary<00:01:03.270> troops<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:04.019> south<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
supplementary troops from down south and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.050

gathered them all up and trying to
attack<00:01:06.270> me<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.600> once<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:08.750> I'm<00:01:09.750> basically
