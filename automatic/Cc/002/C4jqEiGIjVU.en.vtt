00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.990 

so<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.260> had<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> student<00:00:02.370> asked<00:00:02.639> me<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.790> question

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
so I had a student asked me a question

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.889 
so I had a student asked me a question
about<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.020> bake<00:00:04.770> out<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.220> texture<00:00:05.870> inside<00:00:06.870> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
about how to bake out a texture inside a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.110 
about how to bake out a texture inside a
cinema4d<00:00:08.210> because<00:00:09.210> they<00:00:09.480> were<00:00:09.540> taking<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
cinema4d because they were taking a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.089 
cinema4d because they were taking a
texture<00:00:12.120> map<00:00:12.150> from<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.660> here<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.170> taking<00:00:13.950> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
texture map from in here and taking it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.120 
texture map from in here and taking it
over<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.549> unity<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.179> they<00:00:15.389> had<00:00:15.570> some<00:00:15.809> issues

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
over to unity and they had some issues

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.450 
over to unity and they had some issues
so<00:00:17.420> what<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.170> bake<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.010> texture

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so what we can do is bake out a texture

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.790 
so what we can do is bake out a texture
map<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.779> applied<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> your<00:00:22.380> model

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
map that can be applied to your model

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.859 
map that can be applied to your model
and<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.490> brought<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.119> another<00:00:24.330> package

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
and then brought in to another package

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.109 
and then brought in to another package
so<00:00:25.849> let<00:00:26.849> me<00:00:26.970> show<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.720> simple<00:00:28.199> example<00:00:29.119> so

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
so let me show you a simple example so

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999 
so let me show you a simple example so
I'm<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> pull<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> sphere<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
I'm just going to pull in a sphere and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.819 
I'm just going to pull in a sphere and
right<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.660> primitive<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> want

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
right now this is a primitive so I want

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.729 
right now this is a primitive so I want
to<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.250> into<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> polygon<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.590> come

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
to make it into a polygon so I just come

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.030 
to make it into a polygon so I just come
up<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> say<00:00:38.520> make<00:00:38.790> editable<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.040> then

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
up here and say make editable and then

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
up here and say make editable and then
I'll<00:00:41.219> find<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.700> material<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.660> I'll<00:00:42.750> go<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> my

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I'll find a material so I'll go to my

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.010 
I'll find a material so I'll go to my
content<00:00:43.410> browser<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
content browser and in here I have a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.560 
content browser and in here I have a
bunch<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.410> materials<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.910> I'll<00:00:48.030> grab<00:00:48.180> this

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
bunch of materials so I'll grab this

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.500 
bunch of materials so I'll grab this
metal<00:00:49.500> grate<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.610> drop<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
metal grate and just drop it on to this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.939 
metal grate and just drop it on to this
sphere<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.420> look<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.930> our<00:00:55.230> material

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
sphere so if we look at our material

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.920 
sphere so if we look at our material
you'll<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.420> has<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:58.100> color<00:00:59.100> map<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
you'll see that it has a color map a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.439 
you'll see that it has a color map a
reflection<00:01:00.930> map<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:02.190> bump<00:01:02.399> map<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.390> I'm

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
reflection map and a bump map so I'm

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.890 
reflection map and a bump map so I'm
going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> bake<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.290> three<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.900> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
going to bake out all three of these so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.070 
going to bake out all three of these so
to<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.740> need<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> select<00:01:09.299> my<00:01:09.450> sphere

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to do this I need to select my sphere

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
to do this I need to select my sphere
and<00:01:10.549> go<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> cinema<00:01:12.060> tags<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.130> look<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and go to cinema tags and look for the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
and go to cinema tags and look for the
bake<00:01:15.210> texture<00:01:15.750> tag<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> here's<00:01:18.540> our<00:01:18.689> texture

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
bake texture tag so here's our texture

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.469 
bake texture tag so here's our texture
and<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:20.310> want<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> bake<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> color<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
and we want to bake out the color and

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:31.580 
and we want to bake out the color and
the<00:01:24.479> bump<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:28.460> here's<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> reflection<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the bump and here's the reflection so we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.330 
the bump and here's the reflection so we
have<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.939> want<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> set<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:34.040> where<00:01:35.040> we're

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
have that we want to set up where we're

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
have that we want to set up where we're
going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> bake<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.909> texture<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.509> too<00:01:36.869> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
going to bake that texture out too so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499 
going to bake that texture out too so
let's<00:01:37.500> select<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.070> area<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> select

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
let's select a area I'm going to select

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.969 
let's select a area I'm going to select
the<00:01:39.720> desktop<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.950> I'll<00:01:41.070> name<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.490> metal

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
the desktop and I'll name this metal

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.789 
the desktop and I'll name this metal
texture<00:01:47.780> underscore<00:01:48.780> zero<00:01:49.500> 1<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:51.380> hit<00:01:52.380> save

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
texture underscore zero 1 and hit save

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.880 
texture underscore zero 1 and hit save
so<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> directory<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.380> format<00:01:55.860> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so now we have a directory the format I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
so now we have a directory the format I
want<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.310> choose<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.479> Photoshop<00:01:58.110> and<00:02:00.140> then

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
want to choose is a Photoshop and then

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.679 
want to choose is a Photoshop and then
we'll<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.890> choose<00:02:02.130> an<00:02:02.369> 8-bit<00:02:02.850> Channel<00:02:03.329> since

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
we'll just choose an 8-bit Channel since

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.730 
we'll just choose an 8-bit Channel since
it's<00:02:03.869> game<00:02:04.110> engine<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> wouldn't

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it's game engine and you know I wouldn't

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.140 
it's game engine and you know I wouldn't
go<00:02:07.920> any<00:02:08.250> bigger<00:02:08.670> than<00:02:09.179> 1024<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:10.590> 1k<00:02:11.489> texture<00:02:11.970> map

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
go any bigger than 1024 a 1k texture map

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.059 
go any bigger than 1024 a 1k texture map
for<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
for a

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.500 
for a
because<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.579> will<00:02:13.670> start<00:02:13.909> to<00:02:13.969> slow<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.269> game

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
because it will start to slow the game

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.250 
because it will start to slow the game
down<00:02:14.569> but<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.739> this<00:02:15.859> example<00:02:16.040> we'll<00:02:16.489> do<00:02:17.260> half

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
down but for this example we'll do half

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.709 
down but for this example we'll do half
of<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:19.010> 1k<00:02:19.549> so<00:02:19.849> we'll<00:02:19.999> do<00:02:20.200> 512<00:02:21.459> by<00:02:22.840> 512<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:25.719> I'll

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719 
of a 1k so we'll do 512 by 512 and I'll

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.849 
of a 1k so we'll do 512 by 512 and I'll
just<00:02:26.989> keep<00:02:27.170> all<00:02:27.379> this<00:02:27.849> just<00:02:28.849> like<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.859> and

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
just keep all this just like it is and

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.160 
just keep all this just like it is and
I'll<00:02:31.010> go<00:02:31.219> to<00:02:31.280> my<00:02:31.849> options<00:02:32.329> and<00:02:32.930> hit<00:02:33.829> bake<00:02:34.129> and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
I'll go to my options and hit bake and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.209 
I'll go to my options and hit bake and
you<00:02:36.170> see<00:02:36.409> that<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.920> baked<00:02:37.310> out<00:02:37.489> our<00:02:37.700> map<00:02:38.409> and<00:02:39.409> if

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.219 
you see that it baked out our map and if

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:45.309 
you see that it baked out our map and if
we<00:02:40.340> go<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.519> our<00:02:40.939> desktop<00:02:43.629> you'll<00:02:44.629> see<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.079> we

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
we go to our desktop you'll see that we

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.530 
we go to our desktop you'll see that we
have<00:02:47.049> three<00:02:48.049> new<00:02:48.230> textures<00:02:48.799> right<00:02:49.099> here

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
have three new textures right here

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.679 
have three new textures right here
there's<00:02:50.900> our<00:02:51.139> reflection<00:02:51.769> our<00:02:52.010> color<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.699> our

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
there's our reflection our color and our

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.520 
there's our reflection our color and our
bump<00:02:54.439> right<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:55.699> now<00:02:55.909> I<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.870> come<00:02:57.079> back<00:02:57.230> into

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
bump right so now I can come back into

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.709 
bump right so now I can come back into
cinema<00:02:58.040> I'll<00:02:58.250> make<00:02:58.579> a<00:02:58.609> new<00:02:58.879> material<00:02:59.349> and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
cinema I'll make a new material and

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.360 
cinema I'll make a new material and
let's<00:03:02.719> plug<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.199> in<00:03:03.469> we'll<00:03:03.709> go<00:03:03.829> to<00:03:03.889> our<00:03:04.099> color

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
let's plug this in we'll go to our color

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.399 
let's plug this in we'll go to our color
Channel<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:06.349> we'll<00:03:06.409> say<00:03:06.620> load<00:03:06.919> image<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:09.290> we

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
Channel and we'll say load image and we

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.409 
Channel and we'll say load image and we
want<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.400> color<00:03:12.400> I'll<00:03:13.400> just<00:03:13.760> choose<00:03:14.060> no<00:03:14.389> for

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
want the color I'll just choose no for

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.869 
want the color I'll just choose no for
that<00:03:14.810> I'm<00:03:15.680> going<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.040> go<00:03:16.189> to<00:03:16.250> my<00:03:16.459> bump<00:03:18.879> I'll

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
that I'm going to go to my bump I'll

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:26.789 
that I'm going to go to my bump I'll
load<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.659> image<00:03:21.019> for<00:03:21.259> my<00:03:21.379> bump<00:03:24.790> there<00:03:25.790> we<00:03:25.970> go

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
load this image for my bump there we go

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.179 
load this image for my bump there we go
and<00:03:28.750> I'm<00:03:29.750> not<00:03:29.810> really<00:03:30.379> worried<00:03:30.799> about<00:03:30.889> the

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
and I'm not really worried about the

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.939 
and I'm not really worried about the
reflection<00:03:31.430> I'll<00:03:32.389> add<00:03:32.689> it<00:03:32.930> anyway<00:03:33.409> but<00:03:33.470> I

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
reflection I'll add it anyway but I

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.740 
reflection I'll add it anyway but I
think<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.639> one's<00:03:34.849> really<00:03:35.090> dark<00:03:35.509> and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
think that that one's really dark and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.860 
think that that one's really dark and
isn't<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.919> do<00:03:37.099> us<00:03:37.129> justice<00:03:37.849> but<00:03:38.689> we'll

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
isn't going to do us justice but we'll

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.539 
isn't going to do us justice but we'll
check<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.500> out<00:03:40.629> so<00:03:41.629> we<00:03:42.019> will<00:03:42.290> load<00:03:42.859> image<00:03:43.250> and

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
check it out so we will load image and

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.939 
check it out so we will load image and
look<00:03:44.479> for<00:03:44.780> our<00:03:45.199> reflection<00:03:45.919> and<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:48.590> kind<00:03:48.799> of

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
look for our reflection and it's kind of

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:56.390 
look for our reflection and it's kind of
black<00:03:49.370> right<00:03:49.669> now<00:03:49.699> so<00:03:50.180> I'll<00:03:50.269> clear<00:03:50.569> this<00:03:50.750> out

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.690 

so<00:03:57.400> clear<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.409> for<00:03:59.409> this<00:03:59.560> I'll<00:03:59.829> just<00:04:00.129> add<00:04:00.400> a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
so clear and for this I'll just add a

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.809 
so clear and for this I'll just add a
Fresnel<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.739> we<00:04:02.859> have<00:04:03.010> something<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.579> this

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
Fresnel so we have something like this

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.339 
Fresnel so we have something like this
and<00:04:04.120> we'll<00:04:04.389> pull<00:04:04.599> down<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:06.340> brightness<00:04:07.349> I'll

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
and we'll pull down the brightness I'll

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.690 
and we'll pull down the brightness I'll
go<00:04:08.530> into<00:04:08.769> my<00:04:08.889> Fresnel

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
go into my Fresnel

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.099 
go into my Fresnel
and<00:04:09.790> I'm<00:04:09.909> going<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.090> pull<00:04:10.359> this<00:04:10.629> little<00:04:10.840> black

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
and I'm going to pull this little black

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:17.520 
and I'm going to pull this little black
slider<00:04:11.499> over<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.950> little<00:04:12.129> bit<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:16.259> that<00:04:17.259> looks

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
slider over a little bit so that looks

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.950 
slider over a little bit so that looks
good<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:19.349> now<00:04:20.349> when<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.709> hit<00:04:20.859> all<00:04:21.099> our<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.810> can

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
good and now when we hit all our you can

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680 
good and now when we hit all our you can
see<00:04:23.199> that<00:04:23.669> everything's<00:04:24.669> in<00:04:24.910> here<00:04:25.150> but<00:04:25.449> we

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
see that everything's in here but we

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.230 
see that everything's in here but we
have<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.169> replace<00:04:26.560> this<00:04:26.830> material<00:04:27.039> so<00:04:28.000> here's

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
have to replace this material so here's

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.930 
have to replace this material so here's
our<00:04:28.419> new<00:04:28.870> material<00:04:29.440> right<00:04:29.830> here<00:04:29.880> I'm<00:04:30.880> just

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
our new material right here I'm just

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.180 
our new material right here I'm just
going<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.330> drag<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.810> on<00:04:32.139> top<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.009> old

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
going to drag it on top of the old

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.050 
going to drag it on top of the old
material<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:33.940> replace<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.669> looks<00:04:36.849> like

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
material and replace it so it looks like

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.870 
material and replace it so it looks like
we<00:04:37.210> need<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.419> mess<00:04:37.690> with<00:04:37.720> our<00:04:38.050> bump<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:41.880> I'm

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
we need to mess with our bump and I'm

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.379 
we need to mess with our bump and I'm
going<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.090> turn<00:04:43.240> off<00:04:43.300> specular<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.180> can

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
going to turn off specular and I can

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.469 
going to turn off specular and I can
crank<00:04:46.630> up<00:04:46.780> my<00:04:46.960> bump<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.500> little<00:04:47.889> bit<00:04:51.180> let's<00:04:52.180> turn

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
crank up my bump a little bit let's turn

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.230 
crank up my bump a little bit let's turn
up<00:04:52.509> our<00:04:53.340> preview<00:04:54.340> there<00:04:55.330> we<00:04:55.539> go<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:57.240> now

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
up our preview there we go and now

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.580 
up our preview there we go and now
everything<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:58.960> working

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
everything is working

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.110 
everything is working
so<00:05:00.580> just<00:05:01.090> remember<00:05:01.620> we<00:05:02.620> took<00:05:03.130> our<00:05:03.340> geometry<00:05:03.970> we

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
so just remember we took our geometry we

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.350 
so just remember we took our geometry we
apply<00:05:04.419> to<00:05:04.479> material<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.289> it<00:05:05.500> which<00:05:06.250> was<00:05:06.490> a<00:05:06.520> had

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
apply to material to it which was a had

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.140 
apply to material to it which was a had
a<00:05:07.389> texture<00:05:07.870> map<00:05:07.900> but<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.320> was<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.500> procedural<00:05:09.190> we

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
a texture map but it was a procedural we

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.249 
a texture map but it was a procedural we
added<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.810> baked<00:05:11.349> texture<00:05:11.860> tag<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:13.080> then<00:05:14.080> we

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
added a baked texture tag and then we

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.469 
added a baked texture tag and then we
set<00:05:14.560> what<00:05:15.039> channels<00:05:15.520> we<00:05:15.699> want<00:05:15.940> it<00:05:16.590> we<00:05:17.590> set

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
set what channels we want it we set

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.730 
set what channels we want it we set
where<00:05:19.479> we<00:05:19.870> were<00:05:20.020> going<00:05:20.169> to<00:05:20.289> render<00:05:20.470> that

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
where we were going to render that

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.640 
where we were going to render that
texture<00:05:21.220> out<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.639> we<00:05:22.389> set<00:05:22.750> our<00:05:22.930> texture<00:05:23.440> size

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
texture out to we set our texture size
