00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.510
 Today I make macarons with chocolate 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.639
 I give it first 120 grams 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.119
 Pour bitter chocolate in the mix pot 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:24.039
 and to the smaller these 15 seconds up 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 Level 10, I shift it a bit 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.480
 back to the ground 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.780
 our chocolate now comes 110 grams 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.120
 cream 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 Both will be four minutes at 50 degrees and 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.379
 level 1 mixed 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.579
 then I give 25 for the garage 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:55.710
 butter and all that 15 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.710
 Stir in seconds on level four 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.350
 then completely in a spray bag and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.350
 put aside 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.150
 what a shame 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.960
 for the macarons I give in the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:24.620
 cleaned mix top 250 grams of sugar and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.620
 pulverize 15 seconds on level 10 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.030
 6 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.050
 the resulting powdered sugar completely 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.560
 in a sieve around and everything looks once 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.560
 by 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.530
 May 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.149
 at buzzing 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149
 v 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.000
 steal chic 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.810
 then I give 140 g peeled mandl in the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.980
 mixed and three tablespoons of that 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.980
 beloved brother sugar 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.300
 both will be at level 10 for 15 seconds 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.670
 crushed 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.709
 also they almonds by now 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.489
 They can calm down on the powdered sugar 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.489
 be sifted 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.720
 both come back to the mixed ob 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.210
 15 grams of bacau are added 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.750
 and 20 grams of food starch 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.100
 No 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.100
 instead of 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.830
 every 14 seconds on stage 10 mixed 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:23.070
 now like everything again through 7 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.070
 you realize it's a lot ready 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.890
 mayer defeated 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.030
 rinse the mix top and the butterfly 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.540
 use 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.450
 then I give three eggs three already 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.360
 Days old are in the mixed ob and 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.070
 beat it for three minutes to 37 degrees and 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.560
 stage three and a half to the on the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.980
 Now come to the changing chocolate 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.980
 mixture 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.310
 kill underlined so that a creamy 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.310
 mass arises 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.020
 May 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.530
 Paris 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.549
 a trader 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.940
 I now fulfill this in one 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.940
 injection bag 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 because 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.460
 6 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.230
 You now have two options 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.650
 to bring macarons into shape 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:48.130
 either as a silicone or math 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:52.070
 quite normal on baking paper meanwhile 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.770
 The oven should be 160 degrees above 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.900
 Underheating be preheated and the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:03.650
 macarons have to stand 30 minutes then 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.050
 you will be 15 minutes on the bottom 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.180
 thirds baked in the oven 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.180
 then they should cool down 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.590
 and you look for two of the same size 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.590
 shares and fills it with the garage 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:29.229
 You can put in an airtight container 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.369
 be stored in the refrigerator 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.219
 then they will be a little bit more 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:37.339
 Juicy as always you will find the recipe 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.259

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:41.689
