over here scalloped hammerheads are

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.350 
over here scalloped hammerheads are
pretty<00:01:30.810> cool<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.610> use<00:01:32.789> their<00:01:33.060> head

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
pretty cool and that they use their head

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.810 
pretty cool and that they use their head
to<00:01:33.689> find<00:01:34.200> their<00:01:34.350> prey<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:34.829> better<00:01:35.009> than<00:01:35.310> most

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to find their prey even better than most

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
to find their prey even better than most
sharks<00:01:36.179> do<00:01:36.360> they're<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.319> an<00:01:37.380> advanced

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
sharks do they're kind of an advanced

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160 
sharks do they're kind of an advanced
involved<00:01:38.340> form<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.789> shark<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.390> really<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.750> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
involved form of shark I really like I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.069 
involved form of shark I really like I
think<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.159> find<00:01:41.369> them<00:01:41.490> swimming<00:01:41.759> around

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
think you can find them swimming around

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.539 
think you can find them swimming around
just<00:01:43.079> row<00:01:43.259> straight<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.069> summit<00:01:44.429> and

just row straight and summit and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.510 
just row straight and summit and
probably<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> opening<00:01:45.479> level<00:01:46.219> again<00:01:47.219> don't

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
probably the opening level again don't

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.200 
probably the opening level again don't
quote<00:01:47.670> me<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
quote me on it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.109 
quote me on it
