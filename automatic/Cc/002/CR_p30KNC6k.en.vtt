00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
a little bit difficult only because

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.589 
a little bit difficult only because
there's<00:02:28.580> nowhere<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.879> rest<00:02:29.120> your<00:02:29.269> hand<00:02:29.450> on

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
that need to be picked up and I found

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.779 
that need to be picked up and I found
that<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.739> magnets<00:04:21.099> actually<00:04:21.370> made<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.519> great

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
that the magnets actually made a great

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.820 
that the magnets actually made a great
accessory<00:04:22.150> one<00:04:23.080> thing<00:04:23.229> though<00:04:23.349> that<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.620> did

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
notice was that when you have the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.730 
notice was that when you have the
magnets<00:04:25.419> on<00:04:25.539> it's<00:04:25.750> almost<00:04:25.930> impossible<00:04:26.260> to

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
magnets on it's almost impossible to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.560 
magnets on it's almost impossible to
apply<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.099> stylus<00:04:27.580> holder<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.240> want<00:04:28.479> to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
keep the stylus holder on there before

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.370

you<00:04:30.370> apply<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.610> magnets<00:04:31.120> or<00:04:31.270> it's<00:04:31.960> not<00:04:32.169> going

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380
