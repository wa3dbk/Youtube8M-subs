00:00:01.298 --> 00:00:04.368
 Conversations of trains whose teams qualified for the Champions League semifinals 

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:14.679
 [FEAR] It's hard to score a goal for us. 

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:16.197
 Us also. 

00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:17.815
 We're counterattacking all the time. 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.032
 We too. 

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.046
 We are waiting for the rival's error. 

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:23.547
 We too. 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.752
 And all in all we do not need a ball. 

00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.310
 We all the more. 

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.417
 I'm quite a bugger. 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.162
 And I have Mono Burgos. 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.096
 [CONSIDERMENT] For me, I'm careful about saying this at a press conference, 

00:00:57.096 --> 00:01:01.155
 just before starting the match with the team from the third league, 

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:04.601
 that they are a dangerous rival, especially when attacking from side positions. 

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:07.216
 Even if they had no idea how to dribble with a rubber doll. 

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:13.461
 And for me, it's wise to put eight defenders and a spearman 

00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:16.210
 to see if a long ball will come to him. 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.443
 Bang, bang! That's common sense! 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.763
 For me, that's what boredom is about. 

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:22.001
 Yes? 

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:28.908
 And for me, boredom is to take on the training of a team condemned to success. 

00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:33.671
 It's just boring! The monkey could train them, and still win. 

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:38.535
 [TWARDA GRA] My team plays sharply because I know it's a man's sport. 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.140
 Such for guys. True. 

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:47.530
 My team is playing sharply, because they are kicking me with good kicks. 

00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:56.370
 [PHILOSOPHY] My philosophy is to give players the tools necessary for their self-development 

00:01:56.372 --> 00:01:59.520
 and encourage people to look for various sources of inspiration. 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.090
 And mine, trust in Cristiano and let her shoot hard. 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 Both philosophies are acceptable, but mine will lead Bayern to the final. 

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.860
 And you will meet me there. 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.806
 [RIVALIZATION] Man, leave me alone. 

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:21.766
 I left the house about 1500 km, so that I would not have to watch you. 

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:25.570
 But I'm like a urinary tract infection. I follow you everywhere. 

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.910
 You had to ask for a restraining order. 

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:28.910
 I am off. 

00:02:28.912 --> 00:02:31.220
 You can not go out, I ordered all the doors to be walled up. 

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:32.818
 So go out the window. 

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.360
 I can not stand a second with you anymore. 

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:35.770
 Psychopath. 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.897
 O Pep, O Pep! 

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:43.828
 What are you doing here? 

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:45.990
 You have been chosen! 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.126
 Selected? 

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:50.700
 Selected to eliminate Real from the Champions League. 

00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:52.466
 Listen! 

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:55.406
 Do not look at Madrid! 

00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:58.620
 You do not have to look for their failures! 

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:02.187
 Fight for your own team, for its good. 

00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:05.290
 Of course, everything you say, Pep! 

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.800
 But put Casillas in seven goals! 

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:12.430
 E nerds, if you fail in Copa on Wednesday, 

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:17.520
 can you start asking me to become your trainer? 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.910
 No! 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.050
 But this is not such a bad idea ... 

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:25.137
 As if he was a trainer, Messi would finally run. 

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:27.320
 You see, I am your Messiah! 

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:29.316
 That! 

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:31.490
 Eh, okay!
