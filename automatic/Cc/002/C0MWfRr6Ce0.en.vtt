00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.280 
drone technology is coming and it could
be<00:03:09.280> cool<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:10.060> could<00:03:10.360> be<00:03:10.540> bad<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:11.110> all

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
be cool it could be bad it's all

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.930 
be cool it could be bad it's all
depending<00:03:11.709> on<00:03:11.739> your<00:03:12.160> outlook<00:03:12.459> think<00:03:12.700> about

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
farming okay farming is one application

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.729 
farming okay farming is one application
where<00:03:15.790> drones<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.239> be<00:03:16.329> really<00:03:16.570> cool<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.019> going

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
where drones can be really cool so going

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.800 
where drones can be really cool so going
up<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.160> down<00:03:18.310> checking<00:03:18.700> all<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.329> plants

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
up and down checking all the plants

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.000 
up and down checking all the plants
making<00:03:20.110> sure<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.320> plants<00:03:20.709> are<00:03:20.829> watered

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
making sure the plants are watered

is<00:03:23.260> all<00:03:23.380> doing<00:03:23.680> good<00:03:23.829> by<00:03:24.010> things<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.370> are<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
is all doing good by things that are the

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.130 
is all doing good by things that are the
soil<00:03:24.850> monitoring<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.750> could<00:03:25.930> basically

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
soil monitoring and it could basically

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.080 
soil monitoring and it could basically
take<00:03:26.380> care<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.860> a<00:03:26.890> crop<00:03:27.130> much<00:03:27.459> better<00:03:27.730> than<00:03:27.970> you

had a drone doing it you can get really
really<00:03:41.230> good<00:03:41.620> results<00:03:42.130> also<00:03:42.579> check<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.329> out

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
really good results also check this out

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.660 
really good results also check this out
freeways<00:03:44.230> traffic<00:03:44.769> accidents<00:03:45.250> things<00:03:45.459> like

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
freeways traffic accidents things like

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.000 
freeways traffic accidents things like
that<00:03:45.910> if<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.510> had<00:03:46.690> drones<00:03:47.019> going<00:03:47.620> up<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.890> down

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
that if you had drones going up and down

that if you had drones going up and down
the<00:03:48.160> freeways<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.579> there<00:03:48.790> was<00:03:48.880> an<00:03:48.970> accident

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
the freeways and there was an accident

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.390 
the freeways and there was an accident
automatically<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.680> could<00:03:50.890> have<00:03:51.040> medical

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
stuff once again on the scene to take

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.380 
stuff once again on the scene to take
care<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.680> things<00:03:53.920> just<00:03:54.040> by<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.610> technology

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390

that I can get the most incredible
angles<00:05:15.389> that<00:05:15.810> I've<00:05:15.990> never<00:05:16.319> gotten<00:05:16.650> before

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
angles that I've never gotten before

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.980 
angles that I've never gotten before
because<00:05:17.460> think<00:05:17.639> about<00:05:17.699> it<00:05:17.939> now<00:05:18.060> man<00:05:18.300> if<00:05:18.659> I<00:05:18.810> can

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
because think about it now man if I can

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.779 
because think about it now man if I can
control<00:05:19.319> it<00:05:19.469> then<00:05:19.620> cooling<00:05:19.830> up<00:05:19.949> off<00:05:20.099> my<00:05:20.310> phone

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
control it then cooling up off my phone

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.610 
control it then cooling up off my phone
you<00:05:21.060> could<00:05:21.210> almost<00:05:21.360> fly<00:05:21.750> almost<00:05:22.050> on<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.319> stage

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
you could almost fly almost on the stage

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.379 
you could almost fly almost on the stage
level<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.219> film<00:05:23.699> the<00:05:23.819> whole<00:05:23.909> damn<00:05:24.120> thing

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
level and film the whole damn thing

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.929 
level and film the whole damn thing
front<00:05:24.779> backwards<00:05:25.050> sideways<00:05:25.500> all<00:05:25.919> off<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.430> drone

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 
front backwards sideways all off a drone

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.119 
front backwards sideways all off a drone
so<00:05:27.509> I<00:05:27.810> think<00:05:28.199> there<00:05:28.589> are<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.710> lot<00:05:28.860> of<00:05:28.889> really

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
so I think there are a lot of really

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.820 
so I think there are a lot of really
cool<00:05:29.520> applications<00:05:30.210> I'm<00:05:30.659> looking<00:05:31.169> forward<00:05:31.620> to

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
cool applications I'm looking forward to

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.040 
cool applications I'm looking forward to
seeing<00:05:32.099> what's<00:05:32.370> coming<00:05:32.729> out<00:05:32.849> obviously<00:05:33.839> in

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
seeing what's coming out obviously in

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.360 
seeing what's coming out obviously in
the<00:05:34.169> future<00:05:34.500> I<00:05:34.710> think<00:05:34.740> that<00:05:35.069> there<00:05:35.190> will<00:05:35.339> be

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
the future I think that there will be

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.920 
the future I think that there will be
new<00:05:35.669> laws<00:05:35.879> that<00:05:35.909> are<00:05:36.240> passed<00:05:36.270> cause<00:05:36.719> people

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
new laws that are passed cause people

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.659 
new laws that are passed cause people
gonna<00:05:37.050> say<00:05:37.259> no<00:05:37.440> no<00:05:37.680> okay<00:05:38.279> I<00:05:38.310> don't<00:05:38.430> want<00:05:38.639> to
