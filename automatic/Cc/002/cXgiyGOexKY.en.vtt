00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
because they already bought a tablet and

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.220 
because they already bought a tablet and
they<00:04:04.590> haven't<00:04:04.950> found<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:06.180> justification<00:04:07.049> for

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
they haven't found the justification for

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.750 
they haven't found the justification for

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
spending so much money for a product

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.670 
spending so much money for a product
that's<00:04:08.940> not<00:04:09.150> really<00:04:09.600> a<00:04:09.630> computer<00:04:10.079> then<00:04:10.440> mr.

the prom with tablet says this is just
the<00:04:31.770> bigger<00:04:32.010> iPhone<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.420> a<00:04:33.570> bigger

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
the bigger iPhone this is just a bigger

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.950 
the bigger iPhone this is just a bigger
smartphone<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.790> a<00:04:35.790> lot<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.390> people<00:04:36.540> are<00:04:36.780> not

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
smartphone and a lot of people are not

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.930 
smartphone and a lot of people are not
willing<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.470> pay<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:37.650> much<00:04:37.920> money<00:04:38.100> for<00:04:38.550> a

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
willing to pay so much money for a

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.210 
willing to pay so much money for a
tablet<00:04:39.330> when<00:04:40.260> they<00:04:40.560> need<00:04:40.800> extra

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
tablet when they need extra

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.430 
tablet when they need extra
functionality<00:04:41.760> why<00:04:42.240> not<00:04:42.450> just<00:04:42.480> by<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> computer

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
functionality why not just by a computer

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.470 
functionality why not just by a computer
instead<00:04:43.830> tablets<00:04:44.730> were<00:04:44.850> supposed<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.240> solve

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
instead tablets were supposed to solve

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.510 
instead tablets were supposed to solve
that<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:45.930> they<00:04:46.020> haven't<00:04:46.200> really<00:04:46.830> solved<00:04:47.430> it

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
that but they haven't really solved it

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.890 
that but they haven't really solved it
and<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.670> lot<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.850> people<00:04:47.970> have<00:04:48.240> realized<00:04:48.660> that

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
and a lot of people have realized that

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.870 
and a lot of people have realized that
and<00:04:49.410> that's<00:04:49.440> probably<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.980> reason<00:04:50.010> why<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.580> lot

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
and that's probably the reason why a lot

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.100 
and that's probably the reason why a lot
of<00:04:50.940> people<00:04:51.060> are<00:04:51.300> just<00:04:51.480> staying<00:04:51.720> with<00:04:51.930> what

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
of people are just staying with what

to<00:07:37.900> buy<00:07:38.260> a<00:07:38.290> product<00:07:38.650> and<00:07:38.920> the<00:07:38.980> problem<00:07:39.340> is<00:07:39.430> the

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580 
to buy a product and the problem is the

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.400 
to buy a product and the problem is the
video<00:07:39.790> didn't<00:07:40.180> it<00:07:40.270> was<00:07:40.390> actually<00:07:40.780> marking<00:07:41.260> its

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410 
video didn't it was actually marking its

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.920 
video didn't it was actually marking its
own<00:07:41.560> products<00:07:42.100> so<00:07:42.790> the<00:07:43.240> biggest<00:07:43.420> problem<00:07:43.870> is

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
own products so the biggest problem is

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.900 
own products so the biggest problem is
even<00:07:44.110> if<00:07:44.350> this<00:07:44.590> wasn't<00:07:44.860> an<00:07:45.040> ad<00:07:45.220> that<00:07:45.250> aired<00:07:45.670> in

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:45.910 
even if this wasn't an ad that aired in

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.090 
even if this wasn't an ad that aired in
the<00:07:46.000> Super<00:07:46.360> Bowl<00:07:46.390> it's<00:07:47.140> really<00:07:47.560> not<00:07:47.740> something

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.100 
the Super Bowl it's really not something

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.650 
the Super Bowl it's really not something
that<00:07:48.430> makes<00:07:48.610> you<00:07:48.820> want<00:07:49.090> to<00:07:49.180> buy<00:07:49.420> their

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.160 
products and that's really the reason

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.550 
products and that's really the reason
why<00:07:51.760> if<00:07:52.000> it's<00:07:52.180> not<00:07:52.420> that<00:07:52.810> cool<00:07:53.170> and<00:07:53.410> why

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560
