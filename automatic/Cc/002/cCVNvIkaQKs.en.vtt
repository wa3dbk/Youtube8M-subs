factors engineers so some of the key
features<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> button<00:01:08.670> spacing<00:01:09.210> if

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
features are one is button spacing if

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
features are one is button spacing if
the<00:01:09.960> buttons<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.350> too<00:01:10.380> close<00:01:10.710> together<00:01:10.920> it's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the buttons are too close together it's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.420 
the buttons are too close together it's
easy<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> miss<00:01:12.060> operate<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> button<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.619> there's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
easy to miss operate a button so there's

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
easy to miss operate a button so there's
a<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.700> spacing<00:01:15.210> between<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.630> these<00:01:15.780> buttons

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
a good spacing between all these buttons

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.160 
a good spacing between all these buttons
so<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.710> easy<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.509> hit<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> second<00:01:19.020> button

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so it's not easy to hit a second button

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
so it's not easy to hit a second button
by<00:01:19.350> mistake<00:01:19.850> another<00:01:20.850> thing<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> surface

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
by mistake another thing is the surface

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.039 
by mistake another thing is the surface
that<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.200> chose<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.400> panel<00:01:23.790> itself

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
that we chose for the the panel itself

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.780 
that we chose for the the panel itself
we<00:01:25.049> didn't<00:01:25.320> want<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.560> choose<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
we didn't want to choose a kind of a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.420 
we didn't want to choose a kind of a
shiny<00:01:27.659> piano<00:01:28.140> black<00:01:28.409> type<00:01:28.710> surface<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.220> wanted

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
shiny piano black type surface we wanted

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.249 
shiny piano black type surface we wanted
to<00:01:29.520> give<00:01:29.610> something<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:30.060> texture<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.110> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
to give something with texture so that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
to give something with texture so that
your<00:01:31.380> finger<00:01:31.680> has<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> clear<00:01:32.540> landing<00:01:33.540> point

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and it easy to understand where it is

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.120 
and it easy to understand where it is
the<00:01:36.240> switch<00:01:36.450> itself<00:01:36.659> has<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> geometric<00:01:37.680> shape

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the switch itself has a geometric shape

and<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.960> allows<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> understand<00:02:02.130> whether

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and that allows it to understand whether

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.570 
and that allows it to understand whether
you<00:02:02.610> want<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.090> slide

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
you want it to slide

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.310 
you want it to slide
you<00:02:05.580> can<00:02:05.760> slide<00:02:05.970> up<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.210> down<00:02:06.330> or<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.140> can

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you can slide up and down or you can

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.620 
you can slide up and down or you can
just<00:02:07.530> hit<00:02:07.710> plus<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.160> minus<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:08.729> still<00:02:09.450> have

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
just hit plus or minus and still have

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.940 
just hit plus or minus and still have
the<00:02:09.750> same<00:02:09.899> function<00:02:10.380> if<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.590> want<00:02:10.800> more

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the same function if you want more

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
the same function if you want more
simplicity<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.480> final<00:02:12.810> thing<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:13.050> did<00:02:13.260> was

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
simplicity the final thing we did was

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.480 
simplicity the final thing we did was
the<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:15.180> feeling<00:02:16.110> between<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.860> resistive

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
the the feeling between the resistive

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.000 
the the feeling between the resistive
touch<00:02:17.730> panel<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.960> capacitive<00:02:19.560> switches

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
touch panel and the capacitive switches

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.230 
touch panel and the capacitive switches
even<00:02:20.670> though<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:20.940> are<00:02:21.000> different

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
even though there are different

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.700 
even though there are different
technology<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.960> wanted<00:02:22.230> them<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
technology we wanted them to have the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.400 
technology we wanted them to have the
same<00:02:22.890> feeling<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.970> we<00:02:24.120> tune<00:02:24.360> both<00:02:24.690> screens<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
same feeling so we tune both screens to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
same feeling so we tune both screens to
be<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:25.650> close<00:02:25.830> as<00:02:25.890> possible<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.700> when<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.970> use

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
be as close as possible so when you use

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.720 
be as close as possible so when you use
the<00:02:27.690> resistive<00:02:28.140> touch<00:02:28.320> panel<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:28.980> when<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the resistive touch panel or when you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.960 
the resistive touch panel or when you
use<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.300> capacitive<00:02:31.080> touches<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.520> customer

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
use the capacitive touches the customer

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.460 
use the capacitive touches the customer
should<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.570> differences<00:02:33.990> should<00:02:34.170> feel

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
should know the differences should feel

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.230 
should know the differences should feel
a<00:02:34.500> very<00:02:34.770> high<00:02:35.010> quality<00:02:35.310> feeling<00:02:35.760> between<00:02:36.000> them

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
a very high quality feeling between them

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.090 
a very high quality feeling between them
so<00:02:36.420> those<00:02:36.570> are<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.720> key<00:02:37.380> areas<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.770> we<00:02:37.830> spend

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
so those are the key areas that we spend

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.340 
so those are the key areas that we spend
our<00:02:38.130> most<00:02:38.340> time<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.630> excellent<00:02:39.630> Randy<00:02:40.230> we

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
our most time on excellent Randy we

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.630 
our most time on excellent Randy we
appreciate<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.950> showing<00:02:41.190> us<00:02:41.310> around<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
appreciate you showing us around the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.449 
appreciate you showing us around the
2013<00:02:42.209> Avalon<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:43.020> can<00:02:43.440> say<00:02:43.590> after<00:02:43.890> driving

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
2013 Avalon and I can say after driving

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.810 
2013 Avalon and I can say after driving
the<00:02:44.670> car<00:02:44.850> around<00:02:44.970> today<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.280> capacitive

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
the car around today the the capacitive

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.350 
the car around today the the capacitive
buttons<00:02:47.850> really<00:02:48.300> do<00:02:48.570> work<00:02:48.750> well<00:02:49.130> better<00:02:50.130> than

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
buttons really do work well better than

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.880 
buttons really do work well better than
competing<00:02:51.360> systems<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:52.320> never<00:02:52.500> hit<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> button

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
competing systems we never hit a button

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.340 
competing systems we never hit a button
wrong<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:54.930> no<00:02:55.050> problem

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
wrong and we have no problem

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.410 
wrong and we have no problem
recommending<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.800> technology<00:02:56.430> thanks<00:02:57.270> for
