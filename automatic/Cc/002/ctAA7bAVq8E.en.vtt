nope help curb Wilma - equals damage
else<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:39.810> health<00:01:40.259> -<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.799> damaged<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
else and then health - it was damaged so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.350 
else and then health - it was damaged so
that's<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.020> done<00:01:43.700> no<00:01:44.700> she's<00:01:44.970> simple

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
and then create a little cube inside of

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.770 
and then create a little cube inside of
it<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.500> will<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.709> be<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> body<00:02:20.340> armor

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
it and that will just be the body armor

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.440 
it and that will just be the body armor
object<00:02:22.370> make<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.549> much<00:02:23.940> much<00:02:24.569> smaller<00:02:25.849> 0.3<00:02:26.849> 24

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
object make it much much smaller 0.3 24

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.430 
object make it much much smaller 0.3 24
actually<00:02:27.780> point<00:02:28.019> forward<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:30.349> body<00:02:31.349> armor

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
actually point forward for body armor

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.920 
actually point forward for body armor
and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.519> we<00:02:33.060> go<00:02:34.190> dooms<00:02:35.569> what<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.900> is

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and then we go dooms what is it it is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.250 
and then we go dooms what is it it is
simply<00:02:37.380> item<00:02:38.010> instance<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.030> select<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.959> armor

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
simply item instance so select the armor

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.569 
simply item instance so select the armor
object<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.799> add<00:02:40.970> item<00:02:41.970> instance<00:02:43.280> there<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.370> go

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
object and add item instance there we go

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.160 
object and add item instance there we go
very<00:02:45.000> very<00:02:45.450> nice<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.880> now<00:02:48.360> we'd<00:02:48.540> strike<00:02:48.810> armor

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
very very nice so now we'd strike armor

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.210 
very very nice so now we'd strike armor
into<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.099> items<00:02:51.060> folder<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.739> then<00:02:52.739> what<00:02:53.069> we

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
into the items folder and then what we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.940 
into the items folder and then what we
can<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.579> is<00:02:53.879> create<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:55.040> wait<00:02:56.040> hold<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.930> just

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
can do is create a wait hold on just

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.940 
can do is create a wait hold on just
okay<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.879> then<00:03:00.060> fair<00:03:00.540> enough

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
okay that's it then fair enough

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.640 
okay that's it then fair enough
and<00:03:02.519> then<00:03:03.209> what<00:03:03.390> we<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.349> go<00:03:04.470> into

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
and then what we do is to go into

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.400 
and then what we do is to go into
scripts<00:03:05.549> create<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> new<00:03:05.970> fault<00:03:06.209> new<00:03:06.660> scripts

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
scripts create a new fault new scripts

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.170 
scripts create a new fault new scripts
see<00:03:07.739> shop<00:03:07.920> scripts<00:03:08.190> or<00:03:08.430> ignore<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
see shop scripts or ignore to it

body<00:03:09.450> armor<00:03:09.750> name<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.720> then<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.620> go<00:03:18.530> come

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
body armor name it and then we go come

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:28.250 
body armor name it and then we go come
on<00:03:21.019> there<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.079> go<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.829> when<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.040> see<00:03:27.139> new<00:03:28.139> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
on there we go so when you see new to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.330 
on there we go so when you see new to
create<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.620> new<00:03:28.650> method<00:03:29.840> well<00:03:30.840> actually<00:03:31.340> we

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
create a new method well actually we

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.830 
create a new method well actually we
good

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
good

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.789 
good
oh<00:03:37.190> no<00:03:38.190> that's<00:03:39.139> yeah<00:03:40.139> that's<00:03:40.349> what<00:03:40.500> we'll<00:03:40.590> do

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
oh no that's yeah that's what we'll do

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.089 
oh no that's yeah that's what we'll do
we<00:03:41.519> will<00:03:41.720> remove<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.930> box<00:03:43.169> Collider<00:03:43.530> from<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
we will remove the box Collider from the

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.990 
we will remove the box Collider from the
cube<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.609> add<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.450> instead<00:03:46.109> to<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:47.579> armor

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
cube and add it instead to the armor

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.890 
cube and add it instead to the armor
object<00:03:48.450> box<00:03:49.200> Collider<00:03:49.620> it's<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.459> bit<00:03:50.609> big<00:03:50.790> so

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.440 

five<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.260> reckon<00:03:55.470> that's<00:03:55.620> about<00:03:55.799> right

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
five I reckon that's about right

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.680 
five I reckon that's about right
point<00:03:57.989> four<00:03:58.290> oh<00:03:58.500> yeah<00:03:58.769> that's<00:03:59.040> what<00:03:59.130> we<00:03:59.220> did

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
point four oh yeah that's what we did

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.360 
point four oh yeah that's what we did
would<00:04:00.690> make<00:04:00.870> sense<00:04:01.109> okay<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.829> point<00:04:02.099> four

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
would make sense okay it's a point four

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.900 
would make sense okay it's a point four
and<00:04:02.549> obviously<00:04:02.970> fly<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:04.290> then<00:04:04.440> we<00:04:04.530> can<00:04:04.650> go

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
and obviously fly it so then we can go

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.449 
and obviously fly it so then we can go
void<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.810> collision<00:04:07.410> enter<00:04:09.200> collision

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
void on the collision enter collision

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.720 
void on the collision enter collision
collision<00:04:11.459> coal<00:04:12.409> this<00:04:13.409> is<00:04:13.709> simply<00:04:14.519> called

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
collision coal this is simply called

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.640 
collision coal this is simply called
whenever<00:04:15.260> one<00:04:16.260> whatever<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.159> kalai

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
whenever one whatever this kalai

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.830 
whenever one whatever this kalai
touches<00:04:18.340> another<00:04:18.519> Collider<00:04:18.880> that's<00:04:19.660> it

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
touches another Collider that's it

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.670 
touches another Collider that's it
simple<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.590> then<00:04:20.620> obviously<00:04:21.400> we<00:04:21.760> need

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
simple and then obviously we need

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.170 
simple and then obviously we need
actually<00:04:23.680> no<00:04:23.770> we<00:04:23.860> don't<00:04:24.040> know<00:04:24.370> mind<00:04:24.580> okay<00:04:25.000> yeah

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
actually no we don't know mind okay yeah

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.719 
actually no we don't know mind okay yeah
it's<00:04:25.389> cool<00:04:25.630> that's<00:04:25.990> all<00:04:26.110> we<00:04:26.169> need<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:27.040> then<00:04:27.430> we

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
it's cool that's all we need and then we

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.659 
it's cool that's all we need and then we
need<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.449> go<00:04:29.160> player<00:04:30.570> controller<00:04:31.570> PC

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
need to do is go player controller PC

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.689 
need to do is go player controller PC
equals<00:04:33.669> Cole<00:04:34.470> dot<00:04:35.470> Collider<00:04:36.070> don't<00:04:36.550> get

component<00:04:37.270> player<00:04:38.020> controller<00:04:38.440> that's<00:04:38.889> what

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
component player controller that's what

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.820 
component player controller that's what
we'll<00:04:39.250> do<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.669> have<00:04:40.449> it<00:04:40.479> so<00:04:40.840> when<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.530> collides

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
we'll do is have it so when it collides

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.159 
we'll do is have it so when it collides
with<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.790> player<00:04:43.030> or<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.360> did<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:43.840> collision

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.790 
the player it will first of all try to
get<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.380> player

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
get the player

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.890 
get the player
if<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:51.430> player<00:04:51.700> exists<00:04:52.270> or<00:04:52.389> rather<00:04:52.630> if<00:04:52.780> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
player control it exists on the play it

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.950 
player control it exists on the play it
on<00:04:55.710> good<00:04:56.710> on<00:04:56.889> their<00:04:57.220> on<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.419> object<00:04:58.810> it

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
on good on their on the object it

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.200 
on good on their on the object it
collided<00:04:59.380> with<00:04:59.639> there's<00:05:00.639> obviously<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:01.000> player

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
collided with there's obviously a player

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.800 
collided with there's obviously a player
and<00:05:01.510> then<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.960> can<00:05:02.080> just<00:05:02.290> add<00:05:02.500> body<00:05:03.310> gamma<00:05:03.810> yes

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
and then it can just add body gamma yes

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.980 
and then it can just add body gamma yes
so<00:05:05.680> then<00:05:05.830> we<00:05:05.919> obviously<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.340> go<00:05:06.460> if<00:05:06.639> PC<00:05:07.120> is<00:05:07.810> not

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
so then we obviously to go if PC is not

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.320 
so then we obviously to go if PC is not
equal<00:05:08.260> now<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:08.860> PC<00:05:09.160> exists<00:05:09.760> which<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.120> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
equal now so if PC exists which is the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.300 
equal now so if PC exists which is the
player<00:05:10.750> control<00:05:11.110> or<00:05:11.200> whatever<00:05:11.440> we<00:05:11.950> simply<00:05:12.190> go

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
player control or whatever we simply go

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.879 
player control or whatever we simply go
PC<00:05:12.669> Joker<00:05:13.090> body<00:05:13.750> armor<00:05:14.430> plus<00:05:15.430> equals<00:05:16.889> 50mm

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
PC Joker body armor plus equals 50mm

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.230 
PC Joker body armor plus equals 50mm
actually<00:05:18.340> spray<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.639> new<00:05:18.760> variable<00:05:19.000> at<00:05:19.210> the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
actually spray a new variable at the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.050 
actually spray a new variable at the

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
amount and exit fifty by default so that

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.020 
amount and exit fifty by default so that
way<00:05:29.350> we<00:05:29.500> can<00:05:29.590> just<00:05:29.770> change<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.190> armor<00:05:30.789> the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
way we can just change the armor the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.990 
way we can just change the armor the
amount<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.300> our<00:05:31.479> ads<00:05:31.840> when<00:05:32.139> you<00:05:32.289> collide<00:05:33.190> yes

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
amount of our ads when you collide yes

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.469 
amount of our ads when you collide yes
so<00:05:34.800> PC<00:05:35.800> rocker<00:05:36.130> body<00:05:36.370> element<00:05:36.729> plus<00:05:37.000> equals

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
so PC rocker body element plus equals

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.420 
so PC rocker body element plus equals
armor<00:05:37.780> amount<00:05:38.139> and<00:05:38.380> then<00:05:38.650> we<00:05:38.740> need<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:38.889> go<00:05:39.070> PC

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
armor amount and then we need to go PC

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.640 
armor amount and then we need to go PC
docker<00:05:39.820> body<00:05:40.030> armor<00:05:40.389> equals<00:05:41.139> math<00:05:41.680> F<00:05:42.240> clamp<00:05:43.650> so

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
docker body armor equals math F clamp so

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.830 
docker body armor equals math F clamp so
the<00:05:44.889> first<00:05:45.099> one<00:05:45.340> will<00:05:45.550> just<00:05:45.700> be<00:05:45.760> PC<00:05:46.180> up<00:05:46.510> or<00:05:46.630> down

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
the first one will just be PC up or down

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.650 
the first one will just be PC up or down
the<00:05:46.930> minimum<00:05:47.289> or<00:05:47.410> the<00:05:47.440> zero<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:48.010> maximum<00:05:48.660> will

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
the minimum or the zero and maximum will

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.219 
the minimum or the zero and maximum will
be<00:05:49.690> PC<00:05:50.229> dot<00:05:50.590> max<00:05:51.190> body<00:05:51.849> armor<00:05:52.270> so<00:05:52.660> that<00:05:52.720> way<00:05:52.960> it

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
be PC dot max body armor so that way it

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.600 
be PC dot max body armor so that way it
will<00:05:53.320> never<00:05:53.470> go<00:05:53.710> over<00:05:53.950> what<00:05:54.099> the<00:05:54.190> maximum<00:05:54.520> body

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
will never go over what the maximum body

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.600 
will never go over what the maximum body
armor<00:05:54.970> is<00:05:55.240> which<00:05:56.200> is<00:05:56.320> good<00:05:56.880> we<00:05:57.880> want<00:05:58.139> so<00:05:59.139> now<00:05:59.610> we

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
armor is which is good we want so now we

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.290 
armor is which is good we want so now we
need<00:06:00.760> to<00:06:01.030> add<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.750> new<00:06:01.900> component<00:06:02.020> to<00:06:02.380> our<00:06:02.410> armor

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
need to add a new component to our armor

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.420 
need to add a new component to our armor
which<00:06:04.300> is<00:06:04.330> obviously<00:06:04.750> 40<00:06:05.260> armor<00:06:05.560> our<00:06:06.070> mount

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
which is obviously 40 armor our mount

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.940 
which is obviously 40 armor our mount
equals<00:06:06.729> 50<00:06:07.060> then<00:06:07.900> we<00:06:07.990> drag<00:06:08.200> it<00:06:08.289> into<00:06:08.410> prefabs

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
equals 50 then we drag it into prefabs

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.680 
equals 50 then we drag it into prefabs
oh<00:06:09.340> we've<00:06:10.120> already<00:06:10.240> done<00:06:10.450> that

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
oh we've already done that

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.020 
oh we've already done that
nevermind<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:13.300> technically<00:06:14.490> this<00:06:15.490> isn't<00:06:15.760> an

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
nevermind and technically this isn't an

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.850 
nevermind and technically this isn't an
item<00:06:16.389> so<00:06:16.870> actually<00:06:17.139> we<00:06:17.200> can<00:06:17.289> get<00:06:17.380> rid<00:06:17.500> of<00:06:17.560> item

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
item so actually we can get rid of item

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.330 
item so actually we can get rid of item
instance<00:06:18.190> then<00:06:19.120> we<00:06:19.180> can<00:06:19.300> apply<00:06:19.539> it<00:06:19.599> and<00:06:20.340> then

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
instance then we can apply it and then

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.890 
instance then we can apply it and then
obviously<00:06:21.669> we<00:06:22.090> don't<00:06:22.210> need<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.479> add<00:06:22.570> in<00:06:22.720> all

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
obviously we don't need to add in all

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.339 
obviously we don't need to add in all
items<00:06:23.229> so<00:06:23.680> just<00:06:23.889> drag<00:06:24.070> it<00:06:24.220> onto<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.520> floor

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
items so just drag it onto the floor

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.500 
items so just drag it onto the floor
somewhere<00:06:26.349> near

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
somewhere near

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.610 
somewhere near
where<00:06:28.900> we<00:06:29.050> could<00:06:29.200> spawn<00:06:29.560> just<00:06:29.890> about<00:06:30.280> qirush

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
where we could spawn just about qirush

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.890 
where we could spawn just about qirush
cool<00:06:32.820> so<00:06:33.820> obviously<00:06:34.060> curved<00:06:34.270> body<00:06:34.450> armor<00:06:34.750> when

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
cool so obviously curved body armor when

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.560 
cool so obviously curved body armor when
we<00:06:35.020> spawn<00:06:35.320> should<00:06:35.770> be<00:06:36.040> zero<00:06:36.490> as<00:06:36.940> you<00:06:37.120> can<00:06:37.330> see

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
we spawn should be zero as you can see

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.010 
we spawn should be zero as you can see
it<00:06:37.780> is<00:06:38.080> so<00:06:38.950> now<00:06:39.070> we<00:06:39.310> walk<00:06:39.490> over<00:06:39.730> to<00:06:40.480> our<00:06:40.750> body

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
it is so now we walk over to our body

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.860 
it is so now we walk over to our body
armor<00:06:41.940> one<00:06:42.940> thing<00:06:43.090> we<00:06:43.180> didn't<00:06:43.420> do<00:06:43.510> was<00:06:43.690> make<00:06:43.840> it

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
armor one thing we didn't do was make it

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.730 
armor one thing we didn't do was make it
distort<00:06:44.590> selfic<00:06:45.070> collided<00:06:45.640> and<00:06:46.650> doesn't<00:06:47.650> seem

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
distort selfic collided and doesn't seem

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.290 
distort selfic collided and doesn't seem
to<00:06:47.860> add<00:06:47.980> it<00:06:48.100> anyway<00:06:48.520> that's<00:06:48.760> so<00:06:49.120> useful

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
to add it anyway that's so useful

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.490 
to add it anyway that's so useful
okay<00:06:52.300> the<00:06:52.450> reason<00:06:52.570> it<00:06:52.690> wasn't<00:06:52.900> working<00:06:53.080> was

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
okay the reason it wasn't working was

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.020 
okay the reason it wasn't working was
because<00:06:53.800> I<00:06:53.950> was<00:06:54.100> an<00:06:54.190> idiot<00:06:54.310> and<00:06:54.610> didn't<00:06:54.850> set

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
because I was an idiot and didn't set

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.480 
because I was an idiot and didn't set
the<00:06:55.150> max<00:06:55.420> body<00:06:55.720> armor<00:06:56.080> to<00:06:56.200> 100<00:06:56.710> so<00:06:57.160> make<00:06:57.310> sure

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
the max body armor to 100 so make sure

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.830 
the max body armor to 100 so make sure
for<00:06:57.610> each<00:06:57.760> of<00:06:57.880> your<00:06:57.970> characters<00:06:58.210> you<00:06:58.480> have<00:06:58.510> set

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
for each of your characters you have set

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.410 
for each of your characters you have set
max<00:06:59.020> body<00:06:59.260> armor<00:06:59.560> to<00:06:59.770> 100<00:07:00.250> so<00:07:01.060> there<00:07:01.210> you<00:07:01.300> go

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420 
max body armor to 100 so there you go

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.640 
max body armor to 100 so there you go
that<00:07:01.660> will<00:07:01.870> now<00:07:02.050> work<00:07:02.910> where<00:07:03.910> has<00:07:04.090> it<00:07:04.120> gone

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
that will now work where has it gone

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.850 
that will now work where has it gone
there

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
there

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.820 
there
let<00:07:05.980> me<00:07:06.070> just<00:07:06.190> early<00:07:06.370> on<00:07:06.490> my<00:07:06.580> debug<00:07:06.910> checks<00:07:07.830> and

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
let me just early on my debug checks and

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.240 
let me just early on my debug checks and
now<00:07:09.070> what<00:07:09.280> we<00:07:09.340> need<00:07:09.490> to<00:07:09.580> do<00:07:09.760> is<00:07:10.030> simply<00:07:10.540> go

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
now what we need to do is simply go

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.820
