 the history of evolution the american automobile 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.050
 in a ford the creator of the automaker that bears his name 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.700
 can be considered a father of the modern automobile 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.020
 apl was the first entrepreneur to apply the series assembly 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.820
 to produce cars in less time had a reduced cost 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.740
 This is where the phrase Fordism came from, which means mass production was 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.620
 hence also the emergence of the famous model t 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.810
 the world's first popular car that sold more than 15 million units 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.810

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.649
 It happened

 airplanes are exposed in scenarios that have limited their use this is a 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.489
 violent sport how about using money in missions to the North Pole 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.009
