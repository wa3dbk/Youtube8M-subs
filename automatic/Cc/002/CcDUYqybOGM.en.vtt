split up the videos evenly and have

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
split up the videos evenly and have
about<00:00:35.880> half<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.719> video<00:00:37.020> half<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
about half of it in this video half in

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
about half of it in this video half in
the<00:00:37.500> other<00:00:37.649> video<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.370> these<00:00:39.270> next<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.690> videos

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the other video so these next two videos

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
the other video so these next two videos
are<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.350> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> short<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.489> I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
are going to be kind of short so I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.819 
are going to be kind of short so I
figured<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.210> well<00:00:43.020> since<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> end<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
figured that well since it is the end of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.440 
figured that well since it is the end of
the<00:00:43.890> story<00:00:44.100> mode<00:00:44.430> i'll<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.760> ahead<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> just

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the story mode i'll go ahead and just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.450 
the story mode i'll go ahead and just
you<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:46.190> upload<00:00:47.190> both<00:00:47.460> parts<00:00:47.910> together<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
you know upload both parts together so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629

these<00:01:16.710> little<00:01:17.390> switches<00:01:18.390> around<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
these little switches around to the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.980 
these little switches around to the
majority<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> level<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
majority of the level and you have to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.630 
majority of the level and you have to
watch<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> mines<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.520> sure

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
watch out for all the mines make sure

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.289 
watch out for all the mines make sure
you<00:01:23.729> blow<00:01:23.970> those<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.210> whenever<00:01:24.659> possible<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
you blow those up whenever possible and

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.520 
you blow those up whenever possible and
right<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> gotta<00:01:27.810> blow<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.140> some<00:01:28.320> more

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
right here you gotta blow up some more

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.940 
right here you gotta blow up some more
mind<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:31.020> gotta<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> switch<00:01:31.710> out

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
mind and also we gotta get to switch out

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
mind and also we gotta get to switch out
and<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.250> cover<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> holes<00:01:33.150> switch

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and then cover one of the holes switch

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.429 
and then cover one of the holes switch
so<00:01:34.939> not<00:01:35.939> much<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.900> level<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so not much really to this level it's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.140 
so not much really to this level it's
just<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> tedious<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:39.030> all

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
just you know kind of tedious with all

just you know kind of tedious with all
go<00:01:39.329> huh<00:01:39.509> pushing<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.369> also

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
go huh pushing you have to do and also

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
right next to another block you can't

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130 
right next to another block you can't
move<00:01:47.189> them<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:48.180> sure<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.930> that

this<00:02:20.750> level<00:02:21.580> which<00:02:22.580> isn't<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.300> hard<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.690> do

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
this level which isn't that hard to do

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.420 
this level which isn't that hard to do
there<00:02:24.080> really<00:02:24.350> isn't<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.680> much<00:02:24.770> left<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.370> I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
there really isn't that much left all I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.000 
there really isn't that much left all I
have<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.610> do<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.260> first<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.440> have<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.560> unlock

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
have to do is first we have to unlock

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.120 
have to do is first we have to unlock
all<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.280> switches<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:30.350> then<00:02:30.709> we<00:02:30.800> also<00:02:30.950> have

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
all the switches and then we also have

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.729 
all the switches and then we also have
to<00:02:31.390> actually<00:02:32.390> open<00:02:32.959> up<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.230> eggs<00:02:33.500> that

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
to actually open up the eggs that

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.280 
to actually open up the eggs that
because<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.160> have<00:02:34.250> very<00:02:34.489> stupid<00:02:35.290> switches

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
because we have very stupid switches

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.490 
because we have very stupid switches
blocking<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.540> yes<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.720> got<00:02:38.750> some<00:02:38.930> ice<00:02:39.230> cream

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
blocking it and yes I got some ice cream

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.340 
blocking it and yes I got some ice cream
just<00:02:39.620> now<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:41.180> ice<00:02:41.300> cream<00:02:41.690> doesn't<00:02:41.930> really<00:02:42.170> do

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
just now the ice cream doesn't really do

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.080 
just now the ice cream doesn't really do
anything<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.830> just<00:02:42.860> increases<00:02:43.250> your<00:02:43.640> points

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
anything it just increases your points

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.780 
anything it just increases your points
so<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:45.470> like<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.920> Apple<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> sense

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
so it's like the Apple in a sense

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.880 
so it's like the Apple in a sense
they're<00:02:47.330> not<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.870> other<00:02:48.049> point<00:02:48.350> increasing

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
they're not the other point increasing

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.670 
they're not the other point increasing
items<00:02:49.160> died<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.670> now<00:02:50.110> didn't<00:02:51.110> mention<00:02:51.530> or

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
items died just now didn't mention or

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280 
items died just now didn't mention or
didn't<00:02:51.920> find<00:02:52.190> wearing<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.670> selfie<00:02:53.120> I'm<00:02:54.110> not

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
didn't find wearing a selfie I'm not

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.600 
didn't find wearing a selfie I'm not
going<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.500> explain<00:02:54.739> them<00:02:55.160> though<00:02:55.370> because

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
going to explain them though because

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.360 
going to explain them though because
obvious<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.780> all<00:02:57.049> food<00:02:57.470> items<00:02:57.799> just<00:02:57.920> help

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
obvious that all food items just help

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.610 
obvious that all food items just help
the<00:02:58.549> point<00:02:58.819> system<00:02:59.060> they<00:03:00.049> don't<00:03:00.230> don't

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
the point system they don't don't

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.210 
the point system they don't don't
actually<00:03:01.010> help<00:03:01.190> anything<00:03:01.400> else<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:04.190> just

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
actually help anything else and I just

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.650 
actually help anything else and I just
remember<00:03:04.519> something<00:03:05.090> there's<00:03:05.239> actually<00:03:05.569> an

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
remember something there's actually an

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.240 
remember something there's actually an
extra<00:03:05.989> light<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.380> can<00:03:06.500> get<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.040> last

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
extra light you can get in that last

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.250 
extra light you can get in that last
level<00:03:07.580> in<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.940> blocks<00:03:08.780> at<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.049> very

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
level in the blocks at the very

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.039 
level in the blocks at the very
beginning<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:09.980> forgot<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.400> get<00:03:10.580> that<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.870> I

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
beginning but I forgot to get that but I

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.210 
beginning but I forgot to get that but I
don't<00:03:12.260> think<00:03:12.320> I'll<00:03:12.470> need<00:03:12.500> an<00:03:12.739> extra<00:03:13.010> life

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
don't think I'll need an extra life

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.630 
don't think I'll need an extra life
these<00:03:13.519> next<00:03:13.850> two<00:03:13.940> levels<00:03:14.390> aren't<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.780> bad<00:03:15.640> so

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
these next two levels aren't that bad so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.810 
these next two levels aren't that bad so
let's<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.209> get<00:03:17.480> through<00:03:17.690> them<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:19.579> level

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
let's just get through them this level

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.340 
let's just get through them this level
is<00:03:19.970> kind<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.239> annoying<00:03:20.480> because<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:21.079> all<00:03:21.230> the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
is kind of annoying because of all the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.949 
is kind of annoying because of all the
mines<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:22.040> have<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.250> blow<00:03:22.489> up<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.000> dodge<00:03:23.480> what

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
mines you have to blow up and dodge what

you can find a light switch and a blunt
bunch<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:33.010> walls<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.370> can<00:03:34.400> blow<00:03:34.730> up<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:36.079> can

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
bunch of walls you can blow up you can

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.500 
bunch of walls you can blow up you can
either<00:03:36.380> throw<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:36.859> bomb<00:03:37.310> over<00:03:37.579> there<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.239> hit

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
going to do this the more complex way

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.740 
going to do this the more complex way
I'm<00:03:42.799> going<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.850> take<00:03:44.060> one<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.299> these<00:03:44.390> switches

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
I'm going to take one of these switches

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.660 
I'm going to take one of these switches
that<00:03:44.930> are<00:03:45.079> over<00:03:45.410> here<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:45.890> then<00:03:45.980> push<00:03:46.250> them

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
that are over here and then push them

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.900 
that are over here and then push them
over<00:03:46.910> around<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.890> area<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.489> i<00:03:49.549> can<00:03:49.670> get<00:03:49.760> in

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
over around to that area so i can get in

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.870 
over around to that area so i can get in
there<00:03:50.230> i'm<00:03:51.230> only<00:03:51.410> doing<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.010> there

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
there i'm only doing that because there

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.340 
there i'm only doing that because there
might<00:03:53.000> give<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.359> help<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.690> power-ups<00:03:54.019> in

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
might give you help of power-ups in

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.530 
might give you help of power-ups in
there<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.799> also<00:03:55.489> turning<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.359> lights

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
there and also turning on the lights

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.150 
there and also turning on the lights
which<00:03:56.810> i<00:03:56.930> think<00:03:56.989> makes<00:03:57.319> this<00:03:57.500> level<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.950> lot

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
which i think makes this level a lot

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.270 
which i think makes this level a lot
easier<00:03:58.430> because<00:03:59.500> while<00:04:00.500> there<00:04:00.709> really<00:04:00.980> isn't

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
easier because while there really isn't

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.569 
easier because while there really isn't
an<00:04:01.400> advantage<00:04:02.359> to<00:04:02.390> turn<00:04:02.720> on<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:02.989> lights<00:04:03.230> in<00:04:03.650> a

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
an advantage to turn on the lights in a

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.309 
an advantage to turn on the lights in a
way<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:05.120> makes<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:05.510> feel<00:04:05.720> more<00:04:05.959> at<00:04:06.109> ease

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
way it makes you feel more at ease

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.370 
way it makes you feel more at ease
because<00:04:06.739> you're<00:04:07.160> not<00:04:07.310> like<00:04:07.549> you<00:04:07.790> know<00:04:08.380> being

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
because you're not like you know being

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.979 
because you're not like you know being
very<00:04:09.680> careful<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.670> having<00:04:11.480> trouble<00:04:11.810> seeing

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
very careful and having trouble seeing

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.009 
very careful and having trouble seeing
the<00:04:12.139> screen<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.889> is<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:13.130> problem<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.840> yeah

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
the screen if that is a problem so yeah

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.410 
the screen if that is a problem so yeah
you<00:04:15.080> probably<00:04:15.470> might<00:04:15.769> want<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.099> go

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
you probably might want to go

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.180 
you probably might want to go
the<00:04:17.160> light<00:04:18.160> switch<00:04:18.520> in<00:04:18.670> command<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.620> again<00:04:21.070> if

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
the light switch in command and again if

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.590 
the light switch in command and again if
you<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.430> throwing<00:04:21.790> powerup<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.330> can<00:04:22.450> just

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
you have a throwing powerup you can just

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.250 
you have a throwing powerup you can just
toss<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:23.050> ball<00:04:23.170> over<00:04:23.230> there<00:04:23.970> but<00:04:25.170> you<00:04:26.170> don't

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
toss a ball over there but you don't

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.220 
toss a ball over there but you don't
have<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.590> just<00:04:27.460> go<00:04:27.730> all<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.570> way<00:04:28.600> around<00:04:28.810> if

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
have to just go all the way around if

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.940 
have to just go all the way around if
that's<00:04:29.440> what<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:30.340> want<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.580> do<00:04:31.680> here<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:32.800> go

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
that's what you want to do here we go

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.400 
that's what you want to do here we go
blowing<00:04:33.370> up<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.550> light<00:04:33.730> switch<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.480> one

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
blowing up the light switch and one

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.980 
blowing up the light switch and one
thing<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:35.650> forgot<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.950> mention<00:04:36.070> is<00:04:36.730> that<00:04:36.990> those

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
thing I forgot to mention is that those

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.130 
thing I forgot to mention is that those
little<00:04:38.410> blue<00:04:38.890> that<00:04:39.700> guys<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.570> are<00:04:40.720> on<00:04:40.960> the

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
little blue that guys that are on the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.290 
little blue that guys that are on the
screen<00:04:41.410> right<00:04:41.440> now<00:04:41.820> whenever<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.090> light

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
screen right now whenever the light

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.840 
screen right now whenever the light
switch<00:04:43.630> is<00:04:43.900> on<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.740> fill<00:04:45.100> them<00:04:45.220> with<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.550> lot

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
switch is on and fill them with a lot

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.100 
switch is on and fill them with a lot
slower<00:04:46.090> than<00:04:46.420> they<00:04:46.540> do<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.960> light

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
slower than they do in the light

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.890 
slower than they do in the light
switches<00:04:47.440> are<00:04:47.680> off<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:48.520> then<00:04:49.390> it<00:04:49.510> goes<00:04:49.690> the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
switches are off and then it goes the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.200 
switches are off and then it goes the
opposite<00:04:50.380> way<00:04:50.440> for<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.860> high-income<00:04:51.520> guys<00:04:51.970> as

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
opposite way for the high-income guys as

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.750 
opposite way for the high-income guys as
well<00:04:52.420> when<00:04:53.230> it's<00:04:53.350> dark<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.160> pine<00:04:54.430> cones

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
well when it's dark for the pine cones

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.840 
well when it's dark for the pine cones
they<00:04:55.120> move<00:04:55.330> very<00:04:55.480> very<00:04:56.020> slowly<00:04:56.610> but<00:04:57.610> when<00:04:57.760> the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
they move very very slowly but when the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.270 
they move very very slowly but when the
lights<00:04:58.030> are<00:04:58.150> on<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.690> very<00:04:59.170> very<00:04:59.410> quickly<00:04:59.710> so

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
lights are on and very very quickly so

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.260 
lights are on and very very quickly so
be<00:05:00.460> careful<00:05:02.220> over<00:05:03.220> here<00:05:03.490> we<00:05:03.640> have<00:05:03.670> some<00:05:03.970> crack

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
be careful over here we have some crack

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.960 
be careful over here we have some crack
floors<00:05:06.270> no<00:05:07.270> way<00:05:07.390> to<00:05:07.450> be<00:05:07.600> able<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:07.960> know<00:05:08.260> it's

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
floors no way to be able to I know it's

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.310 
floors no way to be able to I know it's
not<00:05:09.970> much<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.270> can<00:05:10.330> really<00:05:10.420> do<00:05:10.690> about<00:05:10.720> them<00:05:11.170> and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
not much I can really do about them and

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.170 
not much I can really do about them and
for<00:05:11.500> some<00:05:11.710> reason<00:05:11.740> my<00:05:12.160> game<00:05:12.430> is<00:05:12.700> like<00:05:12.850> I'm

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
for some reason my game is like I'm

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.140 
for some reason my game is like I'm
really<00:05:13.540> slowing<00:05:13.930> down<00:05:14.260> right<00:05:14.530> now<00:05:15.150> probably

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
really slowing down right now probably

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.560 
really slowing down right now probably
because<00:05:16.480> of<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.900> pine<00:05:17.320> cones<00:05:17.680> because<00:05:18.570> that

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
because of the pine cones because that

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.300 
because of the pine cones because that
one<00:05:19.780> pine<00:05:20.020> cone<00:05:20.320> is<00:05:20.440> kind<00:05:20.650> of<00:05:20.740> trapped<00:05:21.100> behind

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
one pine cone is kind of trapped behind

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.910 
one pine cone is kind of trapped behind
that<00:05:21.640> switch<00:05:21.970> and<00:05:22.320> they're<00:05:23.320> trying<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.740> move

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
that switch and they're trying to move

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.530 
that switch and they're trying to move
out<00:05:24.130> so<00:05:24.490> it's<00:05:24.640> you<00:05:24.730> know<00:05:24.850> causing<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.360> lot<00:05:25.510> of

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
out so it's you know causing a lot of

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.050 
out so it's you know causing a lot of
weird<00:05:25.900> sprite<00:05:26.380> movements<00:05:26.920> so<00:05:27.190> that's

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
weird sprite movements so that's

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.090 
weird sprite movements so that's
probably<00:05:28.330> why<00:05:28.600> it's<00:05:28.840> acting<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.440> slow<00:05:29.830> right

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
probably why it's acting so slow right

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.690 
probably why it's acting so slow right
now<00:05:30.130> but<00:05:31.470> there<00:05:32.470> we<00:05:32.590> go<00:05:32.740> see<00:05:32.980> it<00:05:33.100> sped<00:05:33.370> up<00:05:33.520> as

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
now but there we go see it sped up as

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.450 
now but there we go see it sped up as
soon<00:05:33.850> as<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.060> released<00:05:34.390> that<00:05:34.600> guy<00:05:34.810> so<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:36.310> was

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
soon as I released that guy so that was

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.040 
soon as I released that guy so that was
more<00:05:36.670> than<00:05:36.730> likely<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.300> reason<00:05:37.450> why<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:37.870> was

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
more than likely the reason why it was
