00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.190
 chess developing their pieces from afar 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.470
 the most important principle in opening up 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.750
 is the development of its parts 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.170
 this simply means having them in 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.510
 game out of their initial positions 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.470
 originals, they should be 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.269
 always be developed for good homes 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 houses or houses that attack the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 center in this position the whites have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.550
 developed parts that control 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.070
 how much they occupy the great center of the blacks 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.149
 have only two pieces developed 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.559
 the horse and the tower and they are not in 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.289
 good houses 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.410
 moreover they are not to blame and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.730
 controls the great center 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 when you have your pieces developed 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.230
 to the big center and its opponent 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.530
 has left his king in the center 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.510
 you can often look for ways 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.820
 aggressive even if they sacrifice some 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.970
 play to attack the king and punish his 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.880
 opponent with the white movement 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:15.990
 must play to attack the black king and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:19.200
 develop a white check attack 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.330
 begin attacking by sacrificing their bishop to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.729
 only choice of blacks is to accept the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.520
 sacrifice now your king is very 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.520
 exposed and vulnerable to future attacks 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.310
 usually such a sacrifice so early in the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.470
 game is not advisable but in this case 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.920
 Blacks have played 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.399
 that make white 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.860
 inevitably winning the white 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.950
 bring another piece for the attack and the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.159
 The black ones are in check and the black ones have three 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.079
 choices for where to move your king and 8 and 6 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.799
 and r 6 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.219
 unfortunately they all end up in check 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.219
 kill 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:13.210
 let's move the king to f6 if the blacks 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.790
 played king and 8 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:24.610
 the white checkmate queen 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.830
 h5 if black plays king and 6 1 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:36.510
 so the white ones give a check with 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:39.490
 queen g4 with matt in few moves 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.210
 the white ones bring another piece to the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.370
 attack 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.470
 note how all the attack moves 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.170
 of white are also by check 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.770
 This saves time. This is the only 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.210
 movement to the black 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.370
 we're forcing the black king to 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.580
 move away from your home more and more 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.580
 original 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.970
 this is the only movement for the black 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.620
 now the game is almost over see if 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.940
 Can you find the movement? 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:18.040
 end of white in checkmate note 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.120
 how white people are still occupying and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.120
 control in the center
