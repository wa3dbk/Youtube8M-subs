00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.120 

obviously<00:01:13.600> there's<00:01:13.870> not<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.260> much<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.890> say

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
obviously there's not that much to say

obviously there's not that much to say
about<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:18.120> yeah<00:01:22.800> I'd<00:01:23.800> say<00:01:24.520> it's<00:01:24.790> it's

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
about it but yeah I'd say it's it's

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
about it but yeah I'd say it's it's
pretty<00:01:25.659> nice

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
pretty nice

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.590
