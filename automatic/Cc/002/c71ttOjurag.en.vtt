00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.800
 m 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.599
 kids welcome to mobile and good 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.139
 here as you can see I am in a fixed sport 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.390
 I'm here with good and good watch 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.900
 here you see a fucking team I would not say 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.300
 not a bronze team and you'll say what you're going 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 to do with this good team what I'm going 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 to do with this pretty simple guy 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.130
 I'm going to do a road to glory it's called 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.160
 ok I do not know if you'll know 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.560
 I do not know 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.440
 and what is the truth then? 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.270
 pretty simple, I'm just going to 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.350
 start with this team and based on 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.900
 win matches 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.670
 of wever match that is being me has 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.160
 put one player who bets on another 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.410
 I'm going to be making a team up 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.350
 get to a pretty good team 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.900
 I will try as I say I think it can be 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.809
 quite interesting not since we have 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.019
 acted with you I also think that you 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.770
 will like or at least can play with 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.119
 you because facebook 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.549
 incredible I think it's pretty good no 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.010
 for a series since you can play with 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.150
 you and power 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.440
 could make me a good team I'll try 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.560
 So what are we going to do? 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.770
 of the game against the clock is to bet a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.830
 player and I contribute the price I do not know 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 if he will win if I do not have no idea 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.230
 true or as you see here my team does not 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.690
 I have a goalkeeper sent a forward 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.870
 center that has three watermarks not 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.670
 That's wrong 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.090
 a baby that has three and a baby and that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.260
 has a can that has three and mmc that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.260
 has two offspring 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.299
 and defense, they will not have more, but 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.829
 As you can see, it has not touched me before 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.670
 pack opening that by the way has not been 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.439
 recorded in action and good what I had 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.070
 what to do is record with another program or 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.729
 try if it solved something and good 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.360
 how is this is my enlightenment then 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.319
 if you will like more less I have no idea 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.790
 the truth I know that it makes a lot of shit 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.739
 but little by little he will be winning matches 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.960
 so nothing chaves and I think that I have 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.820
 liked this new series 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.440
 this experiment for what I'm going to do 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.530
 because I get a pretty series 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.300
 cool I will not bring you several matches in a 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.040
 video I'm not going to bring you a game 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.470
 it's going to be very boring I will bring five or 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.690
 six patients summarized 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.750
 and well I said I hope you have 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.850

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.480
