 you showed my impressions 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.570

 all to make you discover the team iii 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.460

 have not yet until completion 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.800
 in terms of duration but we will know the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.800
 truth 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:09.500
 nicolas we have to get out here 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.650
 firstly frankly I have the impression 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:19.100
 that this is the following words of the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:21.280
 reinforcements but it looks like it's 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.280
 it 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.850
 we would like to live 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.210
 oh there , it's really too good to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.210
 heat and grafite are impressive 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.090
 I do not know what's going on 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.000
 because that 's going to be it must be 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.930
 the master who in a chair that will be 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.930
 who remember stuff 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.430
 I am because we finally know that in 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:16.660
 do you serve more exactly the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.660
 the children's leader campaign 2 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.989
 that's it we do not want to play I 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.439
 am really looking forward to playing 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.060
 live 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:38.900
 because it seems to me that abba 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.150
 super-g evoking a success I beat 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.790
 the metal and he will also tell him 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.510
 that it did not work knowing them 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.010
 the market not but yet there is already 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:56.420
 a lot of mistakes that played live 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:03:01.760
 on your steps but I have not yet 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.120
 tried live to test people me 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.769
 hold back 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.450
 I do not have when we hear you I did not 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.739
 not live I'm different from 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.639
 campaign chronicle to change 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.639
 how does this do the army 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.630
 Oh 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.670
 do you have to go early 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.480
 all where is your where are we 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.060
 what do I have as an object a 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.060
 kind of sports mk down while 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.020
 going 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.010
 think well 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.209
 we will remove by cons announced 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.400
 built just blunder that I change the 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.340
 orders then it's a command 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.620
 technical controls and sensitivity 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.370
 who will be m 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.010
 I assure you 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.180
 that they use to an ally I had not too much 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.180
 to be validated but 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.480
 it's more calm all disgusting 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.280
 as I hear it 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.700
 no it's a friend and she houses her 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.700
 office 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.090
 it's really impressive knowing there 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.669
 what to see and how beautiful it is 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.050
 moment very well done for agreement 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.229
 verbund not tunisia nor frankly 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.690
 who is doing well for his magnificent 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.360
 graphics it does not change too much in 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.509
 end of the 11th has actually improved 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.400
 for modern warfare 2 under mallarmé 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.320
 quite well done there we see that 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.169
 frankly it is very well done I 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.990
 find this idea of ​​putting a telescope 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.900
 agreement with 200 is not bad it's 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.780
 original because it's true that I 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.630
 read further it can be quite a lot 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.070
 finally all this for me a good idea 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.699
 I hope that as andy is not too 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.560

 time as in theirs doing them 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.750
 it's funny it comes after a 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.460
 other because it's a way to be a 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.460
 hacker that's it all is actually 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:11.459
 you finally create the sound a little bit 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.709
 two machine guns 

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:17.580
 builders and continuous gunner 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:23.759
 it was not everything if you hear well the 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:25.399
 acquired flat discounts has has 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:30.449

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:58.320
 bubble bath chosen to finish the mission 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.320

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:06.780
