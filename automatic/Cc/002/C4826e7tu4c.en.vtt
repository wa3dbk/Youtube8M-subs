00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.070 
the 3 300 play by twenty-five percent
and<00:02:07.429> we<00:02:08.429> change<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.060> locking<00:02:09.420> mechanism<00:02:09.450> in

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
and we change the locking mechanism in

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.920 
and we change the locking mechanism in
the<00:02:10.200> back<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.629> much

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the back you can see it here it's much

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.400

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
product we are showing here the first

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.390 
product we are showing here the first
time<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.599> BPS<00:02:55.050> too<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.860> called<00:02:56.099> bridge

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
time is the BPS too it's called bridge

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.119 
time is the BPS too it's called bridge
plate<00:02:56.700> slit<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.900> general<00:02:58.290> idea<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.680> it's

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
plate slit and the general idea is it's

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.000 
plate slit and the general idea is it's
kind<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.670> vp8<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:00.390> without<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.930> holes<00:03:01.170> for

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
kind of a vp8 but without the holes for

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.580 
kind of a vp8 but without the holes for
the<00:03:02.040> 90<00:03:02.489> millimeters<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.239> roids<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.440> why

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the 90 millimeters to do roids so why

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.160 
the 90 millimeters to do roids so why
would<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:04.980> need<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:06.030> idea<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.780> have

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
would you need that the idea is you have

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.559 
would you need that the idea is you have
small<00:03:07.500> cameras<00:03:07.950> lighter<00:03:08.640> cameras<00:03:09.180> but<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
small cameras lighter cameras but you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.449 
small cameras lighter cameras but you
have<00:03:09.720> still<00:03:09.930> heavy<00:03:10.170> lenses<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.099> small

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
have still heavy lenses you have small

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.399 
have still heavy lenses you have small
fluid<00:03:11.730> heads<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.300> it's<00:03:12.659> very<00:03:12.840> difficult<00:03:13.110> to

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
fluid heads and it's very difficult to

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.470 
fluid heads and it's very difficult to
balance<00:03:13.709> these<00:03:14.280> systems<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.120> fluid<00:03:15.360> head

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
balance these systems on your fluid head

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.140 
balance these systems on your fluid head
so<00:03:16.290> by<00:03:16.440> using<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.920> with<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> interface<00:03:17.849> of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so by using this with the interface of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.080 
so by using this with the interface of
the<00:03:18.209> existing<00:03:18.959> vp8<00:03:19.379> which<00:03:20.099> we<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.819> the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
the existing vp8 which we have in the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.600 
the existing vp8 which we have in the
sony<00:03:21.360> plate<00:03:21.750> with<00:03:22.170> which<00:03:22.409> we<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.709> in<00:03:22.920> after

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
sony plate with which we have in after

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.210 
sony plate with which we have in after
at<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.849> bottom<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.420> MVP<00:03:24.780> 3<00:03:24.989> plate<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.980> can

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
at the bottom of the MVP 3 plate you can

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.010 
at the bottom of the MVP 3 plate you can
slide<00:03:26.519> these<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.659> these<00:03:28.049> bottom<00:03:28.440> plates

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
slide these on to these bottom plates

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.410 
slide these on to these bottom plates
like<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> can<00:03:29.770> balance<00:03:30.010> your<00:03:30.970> camera

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
like this you can balance your camera

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.900 
like this you can balance your camera
with<00:03:32.140> all<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.620> balance<00:03:32.920> but<00:03:33.130> with<00:03:33.670> all<00:03:33.820> the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
with all the balance but with all the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.730 
with all the balance but with all the
bottom<00:03:34.180> plates<00:03:34.390> we<00:03:34.600> have<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.410> don't<00:03:35.440> have

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
bottom plates we have and you don't have

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.530 
bottom plates we have and you don't have
any<00:03:35.950> problems<00:03:36.430> anymore<00:03:36.700> with<00:03:37.030> small<00:03:37.300> fluid

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
any problems anymore with small fluid
