a bit of a Country Club background but

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.630 
a bit of a Country Club background but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
do you think how much easier do you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
do you think how much easier do you
think<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.939> golfers<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:20.930> mean<00:01:21.930> yeah

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
their earnings potential is a lot longer

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
their earnings potential is a lot longer
in<00:01:24.810> ours<00:01:24.990> which<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.890> little<00:01:26.130> bit<00:01:26.250> jealous

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
in ours which I'm a little bit jealous

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.090 
in ours which I'm a little bit jealous
of<00:01:26.659> you've<00:01:27.659> guys<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.229> 50<00:01:28.530> competing<00:01:28.950> for

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
of you've guys over 50 competing for

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
of you've guys over 50 competing for
Grand<00:01:29.280> Slams<00:01:29.579> obviously<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.240> never

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
Grand Slams obviously I would never

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
Grand Slams obviously I would never
happen<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.680> our<00:01:31.799> sport<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
happen in our sport but you know and I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.390 
happen in our sport but you know and I
think<00:01:36.180> their<00:01:36.689> sport<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.140> extremely<00:01:38.040> mentally

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
think their sport is extremely mentally

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.230 
think their sport is extremely mentally
taxing<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.900> pressure<00:01:40.170> riding<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:41.240> such

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
taxing so much pressure riding on such

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960 
taxing so much pressure riding on such
little<00:01:42.509> margins<00:01:42.869> out<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:44.579> are

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
little margins out there but they are

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.530 
little margins out there but they are
similar<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.560> lot<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> aspects<00:01:47.540> tennis

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
similar and and a lot of aspects tennis

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.520 
similar and and a lot of aspects tennis
is<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.380> probably<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.100> physical<00:01:50.579> but

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530

golf just as in tennis it's so deep

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.920 
golf just as in tennis it's so deep
there's<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.680> many<00:01:58.770> good<00:01:59.009> players<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.460> there<00:01:59.490> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
par on any given day so the margin is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.619
