superheroes<00:02:16.840> are<00:02:17.110> very<00:02:17.350> adaptable<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.550> we

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
superheroes are very adaptable so we

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.520 
superheroes are very adaptable so we
want<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.850> make<00:02:19.000> sure<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.450> our<00:02:19.750> players<00:02:20.200> have

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
want to make sure that our players have

want to make sure that our players have
the<00:02:20.620> ability<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.070> adapt

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.710 

but<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> gonna<00:02:25.560> get<00:02:25.710> these<00:02:25.860> infiltrators<00:02:26.720> stop

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
but I gonna get these infiltrators stop

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.270 
but I gonna get these infiltrators stop
them<00:02:27.930> from<00:02:28.050> actually<00:02:28.260> getting<00:02:28.560> inside<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
them from actually getting inside of the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.270 
them from actually getting inside of the
facility<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.470> get<00:02:31.470> through<00:02:31.680> many<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.980> them<00:02:32.130> on

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
facility I get through many of them on

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.610 
facility I get through many of them on
me<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.490> might<00:02:32.670> use<00:02:32.820> my<00:02:32.850> light<00:02:33.210> fan<00:02:33.540> knock<00:02:34.470> them

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
me I might use my light fan knock them

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.960 
me I might use my light fan knock them
on<00:02:34.710> their<00:02:34.890> feet<00:02:35.100> off<00:02:35.670> their<00:02:35.880> feet<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:38.850> it

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
on their feet off their feet so what it

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.910 
on their feet off their feet so what it
does<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.510> changes<00:02:39.540> how<00:02:40.140> much<00:02:40.290> damage<00:02:40.800> I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
does is it changes how much damage I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.510 
does is it changes how much damage I
take<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:42.270> have<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.750> mitigate<00:02:43.290> damage<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.160> when

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
take I have to mitigate damage and when

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.920 
take I have to mitigate damage and when
I'm<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> office<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.330> modem<00:02:45.630> actually

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
I'm in the office the modem actually

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
I'm in the office the modem actually
doing<00:02:46.320> more<00:02:46.500> damage<00:02:46.680> right<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.610> like

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
doing more damage right so it's like

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.940 
doing more damage right so it's like
switching<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.360> kind<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.810> damage<00:02:49.470> multipliers

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
switching the kind of damage multipliers

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.580 
switching the kind of damage multipliers
but<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.910> also<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.540> means<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.380> use

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
but it also it means that I can use

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.960 
but it also it means that I can use
defensive<00:02:53.370> powers

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
defensive powers

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.490 
defensive powers
let<00:02:54.420> me<00:02:54.480> real<00:02:54.690> quick<00:02:54.900> before<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.350> set

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
let me real quick before you have set

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.290 
let me real quick before you have set
let<00:02:55.620> me<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.860> talk<00:02:55.980> about<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.340> knockout

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
let me just talk about this knockout

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.730 
let me just talk about this knockout
mechanic<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:57.840> don't<00:02:57.990> have<00:02:58.080> death<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.470> our<00:02:58.560> game

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
mechanic we don't have death in our game

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.710 
mechanic we don't have death in our game
right<00:02:59.190> all<00:02:59.610> those<00:02:59.760> superheroes<00:03:00.270> who<00:03:00.450> come

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
right all those superheroes who come

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660 
right all those superheroes who come
back<00:03:00.870> from<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.170> dead<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.710> as<00:03:01.920> often<00:03:02.160> as<00:03:02.520> they

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
back from the dead not as often as they

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.340 
back from the dead not as often as they
probably<00:03:02.880> would<00:03:03.120> need<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.660> game<00:03:03.840> so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
probably would need to in this game so

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.990 
probably would need to in this game so
we<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> rallying<00:03:05.280> panic<00:03:05.640> think<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.910> it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
we have a rallying panic think of it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.730 
we have a rallying panic think of it
like<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.150> prizefight<00:03:06.690> boxer<00:03:07.140> gets<00:03:07.260> knocked<00:03:07.560> out

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
like a prizefight boxer gets knocked out

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.380 
like a prizefight boxer gets knocked out
and<00:03:08.010> gets<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.190> ten<00:03:08.400> count<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.880> get<00:03:09.060> back<00:03:09.210> up

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
and gets a ten count you can get back up

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.270 
and gets a ten count you can get back up
again<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.660> try<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.110> rally<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
again and try and rally so we do the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550 
again and try and rally so we do the
same<00:03:11.430> thing<00:03:11.700> since<00:03:11.970> my<00:03:12.210> friend<00:03:12.510> Def<00:03:13.110> Con<00:03:13.380> is

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
same thing since my friend Def Con is

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.800 
same thing since my friend Def Con is
here<00:03:13.770> around<00:03:14.070> me<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:14.970> probably<00:03:15.390> recover

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
here around me I can probably recover

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.050 
here around me I can probably recover
safely<00:03:16.440> even<00:03:16.920> though<00:03:17.100> my<00:03:17.220> regenerates<00:03:17.850> my

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
safely even though my regenerates my

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.690 
safely even though my regenerates my
health<00:03:18.270> are<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.780> little<00:03:19.170> lower<00:03:19.440> right<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.580> then

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
health are a little lower right and then

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.160 
health are a little lower right and then
I<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.940> try<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.210> rally<00:03:21.360> back<00:03:21.630> into<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.960> fight

here
kind<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.550> it's<00:04:00.150> more<00:04:00.390> about<00:04:00.660> control<00:04:01.320> and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
kind of it's more about control and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.640 
kind of it's more about control and
mitigation<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.260> group<00:04:04.410> of

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
mitigation and if I'm in a group of

mitigation and if I'm in a group of
somebody<00:04:05.010> he<00:04:05.220> might<00:04:05.400> go<00:04:05.580> offense<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.420> might

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
go defense

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.140 
go defense
and<00:04:07.440> then<00:04:07.740> we're<00:04:07.860> sort<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.160> more<00:04:08.670> specialized

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
and then we're sort of more specialized

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.960 
and then we're sort of more specialized
they're<00:04:09.300> bringing<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:09.840> power<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.920> their<00:04:11.070> but
