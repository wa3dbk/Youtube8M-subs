your<00:01:35.880> paper<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.049> want<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
your paper and you know we don't want to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.260 
your paper and you know we don't want to
waste<00:01:37.470> paper<00:01:37.770> nowadays<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> only<00:01:39.119> thing

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
waste paper nowadays but the only thing

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600 
waste paper nowadays but the only thing
about<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:40.049> make<00:01:40.680> sure<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.159> let<00:01:41.430> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
about that is make sure you let you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940 
about that is make sure you let you
spindle<00:01:42.180> dry<00:01:42.509> before<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.380> flip<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.799> over

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
spindle dry before you flip it over

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.340 
spindle dry before you flip it over
because<00:01:44.520> any<00:01:44.790> excess<00:01:45.329> paint<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> stencil

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
because any excess paint on the stencil

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
because any excess paint on the stencil
is<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> transfer<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.030> side

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
is going to transfer to the other side

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.389 
is going to transfer to the other side
if<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.750> still<00:01:49.049> wet<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.619> keep<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.250> mind

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
if it's still wet so keep that in mind

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.330 
if it's still wet so keep that in mind
all<00:01:50.970> right<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.420> let's<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:51.720> started<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:53.040> using

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
all right so let's get started I'm using

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
all right so let's get started I'm using
a<00:01:53.520> sponge<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.090> apply<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.390> paint<00:01:54.720> because<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
a sponge to apply the paint because I

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
a sponge to apply the paint because I
love<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> way<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.619> stippling<00:01:56.280> gives<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
love the way that stippling gives it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.190 
love the way that stippling gives it
different<00:01:56.969> levels<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.360> opacity<00:01:57.509> throughout

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
different levels of opacity throughout

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.350 
different levels of opacity throughout
the<00:01:58.320> print<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> more<00:01:59.790> solid

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
opaque print go ahead and use a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.310 
opaque print go ahead and use a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
Tasha's wearing gloves I know I'm pretty

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.910 
Tasha's wearing gloves I know I'm pretty
notorious<00:02:06.869> for<00:02:07.049> not<00:02:07.170> wearing<00:02:07.320> gloves<00:02:07.590> during

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
notorious for not wearing gloves during

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
notorious for not wearing gloves during
some<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> my<00:02:08.310> DIYs<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.300> guys<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.750> me

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
some of my DIYs and you guys get on me

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
some of my DIYs and you guys get on me
for<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> decided<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> wear<00:02:11.520> gloves

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
for that so I decided to wear gloves

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.660 
for that so I decided to wear gloves
doing<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.270> but

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
doing this but

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.620 
doing this but
with<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.060> really<00:02:13.209> doesn't<00:02:13.540> matter

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
with this it really doesn't matter

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.480 
with this it really doesn't matter
because<00:02:13.930> if<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:14.800> paint<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.160> your<00:02:15.220> hands

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
because if you get paint on your hands

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.070 
because if you get paint on your hands
you<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:16.000> wash<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.150> off<00:02:16.360> with<00:02:16.599> soap<00:02:16.660> and

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
you can just wash it off with soap and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.620 
you can just wash it off with soap and
water<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.280> what<00:02:18.430> i'm<00:02:18.489> doing<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.030> doing<00:02:19.510> an

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
water so what i'm doing here is doing an

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.870 
water so what i'm doing here is doing an
initial<00:02:19.900> layer<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.770> plain<00:02:21.160> white<00:02:21.459> paint

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
initial layer of just plain white paint

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.839 
initial layer of just plain white paint
just<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.720> give<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.050> nice<00:02:23.230> base<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.069> then<00:02:24.760> i'm

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
just to give it a nice base and then i'm

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.729 
just to give it a nice base and then i'm
going<00:02:25.030> over<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.540> with<00:02:25.569> pearlescent<00:02:26.530> white

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
going over it with pearlescent white

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.040 
going over it with pearlescent white
paint<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:27.970> i<00:02:28.000> have<00:02:28.300> areas<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.810> are

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
paint just so that i have areas that are

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.530 
paint just so that i have areas that are
more<00:02:29.290> shimmery<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.250> metallic<00:02:30.880> than<00:02:31.180> others

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
more shimmery and metallic than others

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660 
more shimmery and metallic than others

and i'll have a link down below just in

and i'll have a link down below just in
case<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.380> guys<00:02:47.500> are<00:02:47.680> interested<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:48.280> using

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
case you guys are interested in using

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.550 
case you guys are interested in using
the<00:02:48.970> same<00:02:49.150> paint<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.720> i<00:02:49.750> used<00:02:50.140> in<00:02:50.350> this

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the same paint that i used in this

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.039 
the same paint that i used in this
tutorial<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:51.880> want<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.269> let<00:02:52.420> each<00:02:52.569> section

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
tutorial so you want to let each section

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.750 
tutorial so you want to let each section
dry<00:02:53.260> for<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> minute<00:02:54.010> or<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.310> before<00:02:54.549> you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
dry for like a minute or so before you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.180 
dry for like a minute or so before you
move<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.510> next<00:02:55.690> section<00:02:56.049> because<00:02:56.680> you

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
move on to the next section because you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.830 
move on to the next section because you
have<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.489> overlap<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.150> stencils<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.750> you

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
have to overlap the stencils and you

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.300 
have to overlap the stencils and you
really<00:02:59.110> don't<00:02:59.319> want<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> smear<00:02:59.950> anything

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
really don't want to smear anything

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.160 
really don't want to smear anything
because<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:01.090> would<00:03:01.239> not<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.540> good<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.049> you'd

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
because that would not be good and you'd

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.320 
because that would not be good and you'd
be<00:03:02.350> highly<00:03:02.709> upset<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.700> smeared<00:03:04.180> your

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
be highly upset if you smeared your

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.840
