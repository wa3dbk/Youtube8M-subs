at<00:00:30.899> all<00:00:30.930> and<00:00:31.290> especially<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.309> with

popular sniper rifles in the game and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.450 
popular sniper rifles in the game and
there's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> reason<00:00:37.739> behind<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> mean<00:00:38.280> it's

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
there's a reason behind that I mean it's

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.160 
there's a reason behind that I mean it's
a<00:00:38.610> pretty<00:00:39.120> good<00:00:39.270> sniper<00:00:39.510> rifle<00:00:39.870> has<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> good

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
a pretty good sniper rifle has a good

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
a pretty good sniper rifle has a good
rate<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.440> fire<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.950> pretty<00:00:41.790> powerful<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
rate of fire and pretty powerful but I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
rate of fire and pretty powerful but I
don't<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.230> same<00:00:43.500> level<00:00:43.530> as

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
don't think it's on the same level as

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.680 
don't think it's on the same level as
something<00:00:44.249> like<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> Moors<00:00:44.760> sniper<00:00:45.210> rifle

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
something like the Moors sniper rifle

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.329 
something like the Moors sniper rifle
has<00:00:45.839> a<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.649> said<00:00:46.859> it<00:00:46.920> has<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> good<00:00:47.190> way<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
has a like I said it has a good way to

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.950 
has a like I said it has a good way to
fire<00:00:47.609> a<00:00:47.640> good<00:00:48.120> power<00:00:48.359> and<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:48.929> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
fire a good power and all that kind of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.509 
fire a good power and all that kind of
thing<00:00:49.019> but<00:00:49.199> it's<00:00:49.289> kind<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> awkward

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519
