 to imply that it was out of service and our part here either by the blackout is 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.619

 or as thaísa kardec 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 will attack solution is put on the nape and two 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.680

 the agreement is not just in the beginning 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.139
 so why 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.289
 thirty-nine out come here go look for the symbol 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.759
 simbol the boavista around here 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.109
 so much

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.639
 it at 32 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.649
 always looking and checking pasini 2 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.689
 we can open simon open now 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.869
 we fight puts this here 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 and if it is not paula 7 thousand which is the minimum standard 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.920
 the ipc crack was pulled out that completes 90 years and patterns 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.269
 the concerned tyler null dreaded here 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.449
 there if stretched right 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.319
 reputed to put here also the marshes but for that the videoula 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.559
 very long and this program that the toucan is that the counted 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.219
 He is a dear member as he sees himself. 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.809
 record very extended and do not want to touch a land presents nothing is good 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.030
 so you will do with the other example here you will do this 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.840
 come here 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.840
 and so do I.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.020
 that 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.949
 here was born following technique on the pedal 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.169
 it presents Kyoto the important thing is that this measure in which this part here 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:56.620
 because 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.449
 in the knoll 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.259
 the pedal times in two 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.539
 the tallow such the box 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.070
 in 3 and 4 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.719
 3 and 4 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:07.789
 the symbol 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.789
 if you hardly notice 5 and 6 5 6 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.889

 taken to duty 7 8 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:31.539
 9 10 with the 12 5 tries four shots and the takers higuain 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.039
 we put beds fire that he can handle river occupies very bad says to have 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.009
 Doing this Separating will do what you do here in your 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.249
 keyboard here 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.659
 above fixed
