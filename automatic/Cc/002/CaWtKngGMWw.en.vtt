00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.560
 builds up 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.910
 it's just fun to play with in terms 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.290

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.700
 Here you have made the five colors 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.170
 written to show you some day yet 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.830
 so we did not fully thicken a bit 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.830
 were soft 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.740
 and they are therefore actually completely 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.900
 hard and what i will do my lips them 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.900

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.000
 a little bit of wiping it off so is the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.570
 black we made 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.130
 with the lilac and you can take two three days 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.990
 build up in order to color up too little 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.300
 and they will also be whole 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.740
 soothing feather to have yet 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.440
