00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi where to buy alcohol how to buy before 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 how to store it 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 let's talk about it now and the end 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.019
 look at this thing like 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.109
 spirit lamp where to buy alcohol is very simple 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.410
 in Google you type alcohol to buy 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.420
 space your city name I acted on 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
 This technique chose the first 10 links 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.060
 Looked that suits me at a price for 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.730
 delivery terms and chose the cheapest 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.369
 option because I need alcohol 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.059
 for technical needs 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.620
 called in the morning called from his address 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 houses 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.520
 in the late afternoon a man drove up opened 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.950
 trunk yes he has this for print 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.910
 I gave him a can of alcohol 600 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 with horseradish rubles it is who is not from Russia 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.309
 about 10 dollars a little bit more 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.340
 less than about 10 bucks and all he left 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.949
 so here is bought speed 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 of course if you need to eat 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.070
 you probably need to choose more expensive 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 more qualitatively still not the most 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.380
 I need a cheap option for 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 technical needs 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.400
 there are also more expensive are qualitatively 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.040
 much alcohol is needed cognac 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.250
 make barrels then take more expensive of course 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 same 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.960
 Well, look at the main reviews that 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.470
 write about the company, too, punch in front 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.740
 purchase 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 what's the movie on and then you can call 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.930
 Movies where I'm going to keep 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.750
 First, I'm going to keep this 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.079
 Here is a small flask flask I bought 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.210
 It is better not to store plastic plastics in this 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.400
 flask I will keep to wear with 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.310
 along with a spirit lamp such 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.530
 marching set so to say bought a flask 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.350
 don't know went straight the damn store came 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.400
 jerked thinking for 1 euro here bought two 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 years ago it was useful finally 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.380
 leftovers first i bought with a friend 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.870
 addiction because I just have so much 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.600
 it is not necessary to do so, too, advise 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.790
 sold at least 5 liters at 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.200
 Adequate price is less than 5 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.580
 liter then it turns out very expensive 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.620
 to a friend two and a half to the usual 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.100
 I will give him a plastic bottle tomorrow 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.010
 there are three pours into something further all 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.550
 the remaining pour glass such here 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.920
 bottles 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.260
 this water i drink 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.600
 the bottle will remain stored sleep two 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.160
 storage options 1 glass 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.490
 the best two first options 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.770
 glass containers with ground glass 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.360
 the lid then for the mask on top but I 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.709
 I will not have special packaging 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.150
 store here such half liter 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.620
 small bottles padma melting lid and he 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.880
 will be quietly kept by me 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.140
 one working bottle 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.950
 one simple one to the dacha will take here 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.780
 and and pay 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.580
 under the cover thread to sit more tightly 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.620
 this is the first glass option the second option 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.300
 in a special dish from a special 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.720
 stainless steel but this guests need to watch 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.970
 what were there in Soviet times now 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.910
 special stainless steel because alcohol 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.470
 let's say 200 liters is all stored 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.630
 you can save naturally only in 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.540
 stainless steel the fact that such bottles add up 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.600
 these glass will still be so 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.989
 stainless dishes store everything perfectly 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.630
 stored 100 write internet too 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.180
 Great storage preservation option 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.590
 figured out better have probably one 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.180
 big one there is a big bottle for to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.880
 tightly twist the lid there it is possible and 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.160
 pour more than wax there paraffin 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.430
 saw recently vodka which cap 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.590
 sealing wax said that it is possible too 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.780
 apply the easiest option 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.170
 buy a few bottles of glass 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.190
 there for a penny 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.520
 for 20 rubles and use so what 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:02.410
 a spirit lamp here is a potato with a spirit lamp 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.610
 that nedele will want to look at the tests 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.530
 compare with what is better 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.860
 gas burner is understandably good 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.489
 conveniently there is still dry fuel recently 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.040
 I had a video on the channel about 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.489
 Taganok on dry fuel from the kit 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.169
 army food ration there we 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.260
 calculated that two pills and time 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.139
 boiling somewhere for about 8 minutes look 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.030
 how many grams of alcohol do we need here ? 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.010
 how many grams of dry fuel and 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.300
 compare how much time is needed and here 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.910
 get the answer gas gas to be honest 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.479
 for boiling half a liter on my gas 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.260
 burner need gram 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:50.200
 7 probably 7 grams but all this is clarifying 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.560
 Che will be full video so 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.380
 is a spirit stove here 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.610
 alcohol is poured most likely here 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.460
 stuffed with something inside 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.210
 Porn further unassembled and here 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.210
 set on fire 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.290
 If apparently you need to put it is extinguished 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.350
 such a lid and closes on 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.660
 cover rubber seal devil 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:21.290
 will be with and become so about dollars 15 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.340
 probably more expensive than a can of alcohol here 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:28.760
 this is what's on the package in Chinese 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:33.890
 something here in English can 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.440
 get read here is the principle of all about 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.820
 what I wanted to share for today 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:44.890
 cooking'll have all the alcohol 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.890
 bye bye see you in the following videos
