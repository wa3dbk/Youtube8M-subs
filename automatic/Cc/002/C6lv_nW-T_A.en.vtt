00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:11.120
 I used to want to be a philosopher 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.900
 somehow I will get lost 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.240
 but the 3 always stayed and what happened to me 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.830
 stands out and others notice that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.020
 with the vegan raw food 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.300
 I do not know what important raw food 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.880
 or veganism or both thats me 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.790
 to call certain skills like this time 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.750
 such as human knowledge 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.100
 intuition and so on abruptly 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.579
 you can not get better suddenly 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.980
 say 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.940
 the performance in this go through 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.850
 The blanket I keep taking what 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 heard for feeling is confirmed 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.399
 a short time later 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.910
 and that is so cool and it will always be 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 he sees better through the people 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.350
 like a wood knife through it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.460
 vegan butter cuts that's the way it is 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.650
 the topic should be today 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.390
 18 10 for professionals quantity data versus 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.659
 calories on the back of the packs 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 looks 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:19.009
 Let's take as an example so if there 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 it says 15 20 grams of fat 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.869
 then that does not mean that 15 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 20 percent of the calories 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.689
 the total calories of fat come that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.729
 the crux of history is that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.920
 problem is a fat program 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 you have about nine to ten calories 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.540
 with carbohydrates, it's not even that 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.890
 half are he ran at four calories 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.960
 per gram 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.270
 you can already see the difference 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 a good analogy to this problem is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 Imagine having a big mouth 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.869
 full of water around the tour now 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.750
 splash of pure olive oil 100 percent of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.759
 nobody wants to eat calories from fat 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.780
 that's not healthy is 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.119
 ever said the oxygen intake 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.030
 bluetdi goes back massively and you feel 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.530
 you just lazy and slack that is 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.110
 the whole information on the back 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.429
 if so if you are then 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.940
 Buy packaged convincing 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.130
 that really should be really 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.640
 manageable frame then hold 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 throw away this information it means 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.020
 nothing objects on the 15 gram 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.570
 protein 20 grams of protein, that is to say 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.030
 nothing we have to watch what sources 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.230
 are that where that comes from 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.700
 So we do the pros, I hope so 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.980
 problem has become clear 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.990
 that's why many of them 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.930
 to have made my 80 c 10 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.330
 and then what you have problems with it 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.180
 fail when ten percent 10 percent 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.320
 the total calorie amount of fat too 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.570
 refer is when one is normal many 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.940
 Finished and apache products is 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.680
 it's fucking difficult my vegan 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.300
 is it much easier? 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.610
 It is still free ticket 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.560
 I jameda guys the whole day more 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.360
 making and the beautiful in the panade 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.170
 insert 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.700
 Tonnes and club I think that is 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.300
 clear 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.300
