 a bit secret 500 usinger allowed 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 a crime scene

 the hessian radio has the crime 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.350
 ulrich tukur plays in the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.659
 commissioner felix murot 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.769
 since when can they stretch? 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.699
 ah, since i try to smoke this 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.710
 unlearn 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.989
 I'm always amazed how 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.250
 versatile ability i am always 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.600
 again, they are always amazed 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.049
 astonish 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.180
 ulrich tukur plays for the second time 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.030
 the commissioner felix murot 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.350
 He is a special investigator 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.200
 ironically nostalgic transfigured and 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:15.409
 ill because moore has a brain tumor 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 he calls lili and the tumor speaks 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:25.819
 occasionally with him is one of the am 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.740
 Rande stands and has the great wealth 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:31.810
 and with which we still do a lot 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.450
 but it may be one of the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.799
 reality and fantasy not always 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 can distinguish between so where the 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.619
 fantasy I take over the reality 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.619
 do not know what the reality is 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.550
 places 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.650
 lilly brings his roommate in his head 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.780
 moro in this scene in downright 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.840
 absurd situations again and again 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.130
 blur reality and fantasy 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.130
 suddenly the village pitcher rocks 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.010
 favorite Food 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.670
 The story says it's one 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.959
 small town a village that is dominated 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.400
 certainly dominated in large parts 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.150
 becomes a villain 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.459
 so far so deeply stacked the director 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.410
 justus from dohnanyi opted for this 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.630
 history has a very special aesthetic 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.290
 thought out the credence betrays 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.290
 some 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.349
 I was right at the beginning with the 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.489
 cameraman with the karl friedrich king 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.890
 I already have several movies with him 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.629
 We thought together when we were together 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.810
 tell the story then let us have one 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.610
 very specific camera work and one 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.140
 Choose a specific perspective 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.489
 you maybe also in 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.440
 wallace films but also an agatha 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.700
 christie film or in orson welles 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.900
 has seen filming and that have 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.739
 We definitely already in the beginning of 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.019
 as a concept and have the 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.129
 scenes and also the settings then 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.470
 according to then selected scenes like 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.079
 These are more reminiscent of edgar 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.440
 wallace film of the sixties as one 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.060
 ard pretty courageous this aesthetics 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.650
 and also quite new for the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.650
 passionate actor spectators 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:44.110
 getting used to it alright me alright 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.209
 Well, that was not typical 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.849
 We have them using theirs 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.950
 actually seen as well as have to 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.959
 does not know it looks alien 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.130
 In spite of everything, it seems alien because it is 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.290
 just from a completely different angle 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:03.849
 considers them think about 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.680
 to move here so that there is his 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.450
 virtues 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.930
 a selected neighborhood to 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.830
 example, so crazy single scenes 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.420
 also appear 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.940
 This movie is a real crime 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.979
 exciting and entertaining 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.120
 it's not a mess we make one 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.010
 others have their clothes out of it 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.780
 made that certainly a lot 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.150
 quotes that would have to appear in the film 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.169
 singing detective in there you have edgar 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.860
 wallace maybe a bit 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.300
 hitchcock always wants to understand 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.130
 rocky horror picture show is yes 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.810
 all sorts of things there's a game with 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.060
 the song and I think that was wrong 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.830
 format he is so robust that too 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.680
 endures and I think after 40 years 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.240
 you can also make a joke 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.169
 and this rubbish will definitely be 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.510
 continued 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.500
 a third crime scene with ulrich tukur is 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.500
 already in planning 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.450

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.450

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.850

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.580

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:12.460

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:32.470
 complicated but I have a lot 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.110
 better I have for them is the death 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.900
 a cashier 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.810
 That's a great story 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.620
