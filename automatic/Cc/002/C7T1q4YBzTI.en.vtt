00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
more sense since in sports players are

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
more sense since in sports players are
relatively<00:01:02.640> interchangeable<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> mean<00:01:03.750> wasn't

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's a business and the goal is to make

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
that should be noted is that the Blue

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.690

episode<00:04:30.849> I<00:04:31.030> naturally<00:04:31.330> assumed<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:32.050> the

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
episode I naturally assumed that the

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.869 
episode I naturally assumed that the
Wonderbolts<00:04:32.500> were<00:04:32.800> just<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.129> military<00:04:33.430> court

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879

but<00:04:34.150> their<00:04:34.330> depiction<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.110> episode

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469 
but their depiction in that episode

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.679 
but their depiction in that episode
seems<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:36.099> contradict<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.669> as<00:04:36.939> a<00:04:37.000> result<00:04:37.360> I'm

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:37.689 
seems to contradict that as a result I'm

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.629 
seems to contradict that as a result I'm
confident<00:04:38.409> in<00:04:38.560> my<00:04:38.680> assessment<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.340> the

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
confident in my assessment that the

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.790 
confident in my assessment that the
Wonderbolts<00:04:40.030> are<00:04:40.449> not<00:04:40.810> soldiers<00:04:41.500> not
