00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.119 
now you can see what i'm doing here is
i'm<00:00:03.340> working<00:00:03.969> the<00:00:04.000> dog<00:00:04.240> next<00:00:04.480> to<00:00:04.660> a<00:00:04.750> step<00:00:05.169> which

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:06.129 
i'm working the dog next to a step which

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.610 
i'm working the dog next to a step which
is<00:00:06.160> a<00:00:06.430> physical<00:00:07.089> boundary<00:00:07.539> which<00:00:07.839> prevents

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
is a physical boundary which prevents

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.400 
is a physical boundary which prevents
the<00:00:08.740> dog<00:00:08.920> from<00:00:09.540> sitting<00:00:10.540> crooked<00:00:10.720> because<00:00:11.230> if

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
the dog from sitting crooked because if

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.440 
the dog from sitting crooked because if
you<00:00:11.500> were<00:00:11.620> to<00:00:11.740> try<00:00:11.920> and<00:00:12.100> sit<00:00:12.370> crooked<00:00:12.610> you

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
you were to try and sit crooked you

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.780 
you were to try and sit crooked you
would<00:00:13.630> fall<00:00:13.840> off<00:00:13.870> the<00:00:14.260> edge<00:00:14.350> of<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.560> step<00:00:14.860> now

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
would fall off the edge of the step now

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.099 
would fall off the edge of the step now
if<00:00:15.970> you're<00:00:16.090> working<00:00:16.209> outside<00:00:16.660> you<00:00:16.869> could<00:00:17.019> use

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
if you're working outside you could use

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.870 
if you're working outside you could use
a<00:00:17.140> curb<00:00:17.499> it<00:00:17.949> doesn't<00:00:18.249> want<00:00:18.369> to<00:00:18.429> matter<00:00:18.609> you

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
a curb it doesn't want to matter you

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.689 
a curb it doesn't want to matter you
could<00:00:19.060> use<00:00:19.179> a<00:00:19.210> bench<00:00:20.249> but<00:00:21.249> any<00:00:21.429> kind<00:00:21.669> of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
could use a bench but any kind of

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.950 
could use a bench but any kind of
physical<00:00:21.849> boundary<00:00:22.449> where<00:00:22.630> there's<00:00:22.900> a

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
physical boundary where there's a

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.529 
physical boundary where there's a
difference<00:00:23.890> between<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.789> hot<00:00:24.970> zone<00:00:24.999> and<00:00:25.480> the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
difference between the hot zone and the

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.720 
difference between the hot zone and the
safe<00:00:25.720> zone<00:00:26.019> for<00:00:26.589> the<00:00:26.679> dog<00:00:26.890> so<00:00:27.279> it<00:00:27.310> makes<00:00:27.550> it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
safe zone for the dog so it makes it

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.329 
safe zone for the dog so it makes it
easy<00:00:28.029> for<00:00:28.179> him<00:00:28.419> to<00:00:28.480> understand<00:00:29.109> now<00:00:29.919> all<00:00:30.220> I'm

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
easy for him to understand now all I'm

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.249 
easy for him to understand now all I'm
doing<00:00:30.730> is<00:00:30.849> I'm<00:00:31.029> breaking<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.449> exercise<00:00:32.050> up

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
doing is I'm breaking the exercise up

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.740 
doing is I'm breaking the exercise up
into<00:00:32.649> a<00:00:32.680> smaller<00:00:33.609> portion<00:00:33.940> so<00:00:34.390> instead<00:00:34.690> of

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
into a smaller portion so instead of

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.860 
into a smaller portion so instead of
working<00:00:35.500> with<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.859> dog<00:00:36.070> from<00:00:36.340> 25<00:00:37.120> or<00:00:37.390> 50<00:00:37.510> or

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
recall with the heel position at the end

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.180 
recall with the heel position at the end
of<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:45.399> wearing<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.239> dog<00:00:46.390> out<00:00:46.600> I'm<00:00:46.780> just
