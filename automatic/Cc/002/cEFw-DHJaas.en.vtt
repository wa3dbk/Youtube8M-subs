00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello everyone is turned on with 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.080
 entire sections of rne on the server 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.750
 height pixel and good today 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.510
 I'm going to talk about a rather curious topic 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.550
 7 last night and a video that rose zombie 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.470
 cntv that is a pretty famous channel that 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.510
 is dedicated to making compilations of the top 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.950
 of video games and others that I will leave 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.840
 because there is also the video that I saw 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.910
 last night of this channel is a channel that 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.860
 I've been following for a while and I'm falling 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.629
 abuses there is a channel that followed 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.160
 quite some time following and that has 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.469
 always liked to see me entertain 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.450
 Pretty is a Latino guy has a pint 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.960
 because the voice that has between modes of 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.300
 Latin boy a lot of my mother and 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.520
 good what I was saying because yesterday I am 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.110
 a video of 5 good reasons because I 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.790
 you think he's fucked up like that literally 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.920
 that is the title with mediatic said 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.410
 video you have it here below and it's good 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.730
 a video in which he talks about why not 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.280
 there's back is fucked from now 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.710
 because of the buy microsoft and good in 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.870
 the video basically what is focused is 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.699
 that to start he says that microsoft 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.440
 will continue to update the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.650
 sonic platform 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.720
 and I think you were wrong because of 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.850
 that currently even the day of 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.340
 halloween a picture of the ps was published 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 vita with the game of minecraft 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.869
 running inside according to just 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.580
 and you see how they are updating said 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.100
 version since you see the weather and the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.310
 witches therefore there has skated a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.290
 little normal I do not know anything but of course it is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.210
 that I currently microsoft is not 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.680
 leaving álava sony but maybe this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.380
 boy and I fall back because this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 it's more than anything else what's going 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.369
 saying may it currently be worth 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.320
 microsoft keeps updating sony but 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 Maybe we'll stop doing it in the future 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.680
 but when the current fashion that is what 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.049
 what have you done in the video 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.450
 currently you only have the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.280
 backing of glasses or how much minecraft and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.229
 continues to update itself there is nothing 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.790
 say not even there is a video that you see 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.790
 from microsoft head 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.160
 this is the third one that was called then 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.330
 clearly says that not for now 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.640
 they want to follow that the community more 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.929
 grace they enjoy said game and only 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.060
 I was going to keep on having the backing 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.550
 necessary to continue using 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.170
 from behind we go there's no 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.460
 capacity provided in the platform 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.040
 sun and both play 3 playstation 4 ps vita 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.440
 therefore there is something at the moment 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.450
 there are authors three console parts so 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.200
 we are both happy about that part and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.780
 on the other hand he pulled a fragment of the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.940
 documentary about moving over 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.560
 minecraft is on youtube you can see it 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.810
 a video of an hour and a half or something like that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.550
 is Spanish subtitled even and 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.060
 good in this video it looks like night 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.620
 says that at school they told him what is 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.270
 what will you get to do something like 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.430
 who is currently a creator of 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.709
 video games a teacher even the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.030
 guide that tells you here you aspire a 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.590
 future but so to say but it only 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.700
 prepare more really because you can 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.370
 whatever you want after a 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.400
 future but good because it is clearly seen 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.740
 as 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.090
 and video games and nothing and look come look 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.160
 where night has come creator 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.020
 minecraft and in said video 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.470
 says that he has thought that a future 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.200
 of the company will continue to be 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.240
 them that there were many people who offered 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.610
 money to create mai that I hope to say 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.470
 when the first version of mike came out 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.320
 the many companies you wanted to contribute 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.330
 capital for me I fall I do not fall 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.010
 good that third nothing happens now 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.870
 let's play another what many said 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.050
 companies wanted to provide capital for 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.780
 be able to take profit minecraft but 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.060
 nights said no I do not want against people 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.709
 10,000 I do not want anyone to participate 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.170
 in this idea I want this idea to be 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.209
 chignon only team that is as 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.890
 kept and it seems right to me to say 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.360
 all the income was taken by them 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.090
 who were the true creators of the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.840
 game and at the end 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.209
 sold very well to another company thing that 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.670
 with your words so to speak because 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.580
 supposedly he wanted me to always 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.800
 outside of the true creator team in 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.620
 the games of another external company but 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.480
 good for x night reason has been seen 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.950
 overwhelmed as I said in the video are a 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.319
 challenge when I made the news that 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.680
 microsoft has bought minecraft or good 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.479
 as already together as he said it already 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.489
 it looked and they are post even your page 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.900
 saying that I could not stand as much 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.639
 fame 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.440
 the fame price is quite hard there are 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.720
 to say it there are people who can not stand it and it is 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.610
 normal this is something good you like 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.889
 they come to your house they ring the bell 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.180
 things has been preparatory by the street 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.360
 my mother how is this bored 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.750
 server today and clear the video reason for 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.850
 why microsoft motion media and in those 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.450
 good reasons I could not stand such fame and 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.450
 good 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:59.490
 somni cntv the creator of said video 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:02.430
 under what looks like some things 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.680
 long time microsoft minecraft 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.870
 microsoft we have said but it is normal 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.730
 I think normal that the night with the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.440
 time has been overwhelmed because 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.960
 It has a lot of responsibility 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.600
 make will be minecraft today in miami 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.120
 we should go fell on nights because 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.160
 night is the owner of the company was the 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.750
 Clear business owner he arrived point 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.730
 he said I can not stand all this 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.440
 therefore and if I do not understand what is not 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.610
 I understand it's a pasture that was paid for 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.919
 good minecraft for endless dock 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.020
 when it was a pasture it was a lot of pasta 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.180
 now I remember exactly proceed to 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.810
 give off a little tea and I'm not 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.000
 livened livened tipsy tipsy 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.440
 and know this much was paid for 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.450
 moyano is that way and good but the fact 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.620
 that is sold to Microsoft 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.440
 moya and minecraft and good for now 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.970
 we see that these more goes on wheels of 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.680
 moment is updating I am left 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.139
 xbox we've already been videos these days 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.389
 well they're still coming out that's going to 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.540
 bring your next 17 next 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.810
 version of xbox and playstation the more 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.810
 sure console versions let's go 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.810
 but 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.610
 but good the moment everything goes on 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.990
 wheels let's go nothing has stopped the vision of 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.580
 that moment is a little bit more 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.979
 despacito because it does nothing left in 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.810
 the 2.8 are working on 1.8 point 1 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.520
 and has also confirmed Ramón that 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.349
 is working the two points 9 but of 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.180
 They have said that they will have that 1.9 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.430
 logically it's quite early for 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.169
 talk about it but if the car point 83 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.460
 performance improvements and others I think 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.349
 the right thing we're going at the moment has not 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.389
 gone out today has left it has not left us 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.400
 Exactly we are in detail the pre version 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.770
 realistic in all three I think we were 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.190
 but there is no official day of 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.409
 output of this 1.9 not to 1.8 for everything 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.750
 that I mess but it will be added this week 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.580
 the next good I just wanted to talk 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.919
 of the video below here as I say 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.240
 I wanted to talk about that topic about if they are and 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.090
 will continue to update would be I think 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.340
 if I start so for the moment if there is not 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.909
 no reason why to say no 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.639
 there is I fall down my god and also talk 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.590
 about that about night that I think what 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.639
 has done that because fame costs 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.380
 money 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.990
 not literally speaking money if the 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.030
 has its pros and cons logically 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.530
 and he has been overwhelmed and he is already 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.090
 food and came back have work in him 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.970
 quite like the video because good the 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.740
 opinion of the file and others but I wanted 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.720
 emphasize that about sun and night I think 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.360
 What's the boy for you? 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.070
 they were sending you sonic shi'i since 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.870
 as I say they were going to keep updated 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.940
 you but what you see and well I'll go to 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.620
 lobby to dismiss the video and good 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.870
 I'm watching the video for today I hope that 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.640
 have not boring I think it has been 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.320
 entertaining that has not won cricket 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.240
 third the first not really good 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.010
 me this video to be able to play and 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.840
 time to speak for the USA had to be 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.160
 visible in the video and at the same time talk 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.260
 on the subject that I wanted to discuss
