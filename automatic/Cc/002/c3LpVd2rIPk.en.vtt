around<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.550> as<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.300> that's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
around them as you can see there that's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.080 
around them as you can see there that's
the<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.140> difference<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.649> thickness<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the the difference in thickness so the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
the the difference in thickness so the
the<00:00:39.510> ipad<00:00:39.809> mini<00:00:39.840> comes<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.649> seven

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the ipad mini comes in at seven

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.000 
the ipad mini comes in at seven
millimeters<00:00:42.000> whereas<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.379> 7.2

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.830 
millimeters whereas the more 7.2
millimeters<00:00:44.520> whereas<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> Nexus<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.480> 10<00:00:45.690> and

the<00:00:51.960> same<00:00:52.230> width<00:00:53.039> wise<00:00:53.370> you've<00:00:53.730> got<00:00:54.289> 120

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the same width wise you've got 120

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.510 
the same width wise you've got 120
millimeters<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> Nexus<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.739> 135<00:00:58.739> for

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the ipad mini give you a quick look at

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.260 
the ipad mini give you a quick look at
the<00:01:01.949> back<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.340> middle<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> our<00:01:02.789> whenever<00:01:03.180> a

the back of the middle of our whenever a
few<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.660> specs<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.119> iPad<00:01:06.450> probably

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
few more specs so the the iPad probably

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
few more specs so the the iPad probably
looks<00:01:06.900> better<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> bat<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.799> Nexus

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
looks better on the bat but the Nexus

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.310 
looks better on the bat but the Nexus
definitely<00:01:09.060> seems<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.360> more<00:01:09.479> durable<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.110> with

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
definitely seems a more durable one with
