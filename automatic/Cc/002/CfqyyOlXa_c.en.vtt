00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.980
 6 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.390
 hi everyone happened when 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.310
 this country if a day today for a 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.050
 Video special because quite magical enough 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.430
 effect it's my big comeback my big 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.689
 come back on call of duty modern 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.619
 warfare 2 so for those who me 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.660
 do not know why I say my 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.279
 back my come back because indeed since 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.140
 three weeks I was leaving in 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.790
 holidays so I'm not going to my pc to 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.400
 provision so that's it's done that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.170
 it is said room packed 1 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.910
 so I said heaven in a scrum 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.140
 general on the map what rhyme after 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.089
 particularly fond of 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.210
 this game mode because indeed the spawn 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.550
 are pretty random and then people 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.890
 finally I mean the formation of maps 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.120
 the formation of the amap de cuari is 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.160
 really something that I like everything 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.079
 especially it's with turns 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.059
 at right angles ie the spawn 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.070
 are not too messy we 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.809
 start we can see quite clearly 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.550
 our costs we do not necessarily have to 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.910
 to have an extraordinary level in 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.890
 snipe even if the migrant e I'm laughing and 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.940
 So here I am telling you the score 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 that I did this is the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.580
 only to death I have that I had 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.289
 throughout the game 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.500
 I did the 30 so it's a score 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.759
 pretty magical enough luminescent sure 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.140
 the little monarch by two camps in 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.490
 effect I did that play sniper and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.200
 in the desert teagle a few times I 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.910
 switched 1 because frankly as much 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.860
 brittle than let the guys kill you 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.300
 while you have more of your more than 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 accuracy and sniper a frankly this 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.140
 would be silly to die so why 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.140
 I love friends general scrum too 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.289
 just liked because I have that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.270
 get drunk playing r &amp; d r &amp; d ya 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.679
 always the fever of knitters that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.050
 scrum gerald it's a question a 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.580
 question of speed a question 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.140
 of agility a question of increased if yes 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.099
 that's the word that in English greeted 6 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.080
 to 2 c to cy yes that's it I know 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.520
 not how do you say in french good me 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.840
 I was looking for 300 it's going to be written on 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.489
 the screen here hop there so here is this too 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.959
 that I love is general scrum it's the 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:07.369
 is necessarily power switcher 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.590
 on any weapon when you 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.800
 have more things available here 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.560
 like here do not look for h to shoot down 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.910
 not necessarily the guy sniper if you 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.410
 have myth marker you can everything to 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.120
 worried because indeed the enemies are going 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.440
 flock around you so that's not the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.790
 time wasting on one 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.079
 enemy that would be completely silly 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.610
 so this is a tip that I give you 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.830
 to successfully complete a general scrum 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.660
 so also I decided to send this 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.190
 qg code video and side by side these aids 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.390
 here is the little qg code logo that is 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.610
 quite special so I decided to send 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.170
 this video is that of qg to see if 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.910
 the community a little less arduous at this 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.110
 point to see if it's easy enough 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.630
 to go there since the last time 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.700
 it was complicated and I stretched 10.71 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.170
 that's why not a choco of qg if that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.780
 pass so much better not so bad 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.460
 here is temple that's it's done then 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.960
 down so what I loved during this 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.830
 part of it is that at the end there are plenty of 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.600
 people who added me to their list 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.610
 of friends like that I had a mbodj where 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.050
 I had a radar and well no I have no 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.820
 radar I have no boots there are 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.800
 red dots indeed because I have 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.640
 activated a drone and people can pull that 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.900
 makes a red dot for those who 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.690
 do not know the general scrum 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.489
 so I often have for people who me 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.770
 know on my channel I play in May 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.830
 and general under a series named marc 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.590
 atistes which consists of playing the marathon 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.060
 in general melee is to finish first 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.190
 but on necessarily with less than ten 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.570
 dead so it's really a series that 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.850
 a lot of people followed me for that 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.470
 so I decided after being 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.209
 trained the state twice with 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.290
 marathon to return on pass passes 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.520
 because indeed not really happened 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.350
 the ultimate army 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.000
 finally the ultimate asset in the scrum 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.799
 when you're a fan of hustling you 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.940
 can demolish anyone with a 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.019
 surprising speed here you have 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.000
 really good reflexes 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.200
 it's really the ultimate weapon so that's it 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.549
 it's the end of the game I hope that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.500
 these fairly clear gameplay fast enough 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.790
 you will have liked people listen and me 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.720
 it made me great pleasure to you 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.820
 comment this video 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.080
 Well, I'll tell you healthier for a 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.610
 other video i'm going to start doing 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.360
 tutos soon so went to visit my 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.250
 tutor etc. 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.150
 everything will come people I tell you to 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.150
 poorer
