stuff with this thing and something that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.390 
stuff with this thing and something that
helped<00:01:07.979> me<00:01:08.159> kind<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.869> figure<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.260> was<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
helped me kind of figure this out was I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
helped me kind of figure this out was I
noticed<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:12.000> while<00:01:12.299> back<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
noticed a while back when I was when I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.050 
noticed a while back when I was when I
was<00:01:13.979> trying<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.250> figure<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> navigate

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
was trying to figure out how to navigate

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.920 
was trying to figure out how to navigate
the<00:01:15.420> kit<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.810> speed<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:17.659> doing<00:01:18.659> something

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the kit with speed that doing something

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.289 
the kit with speed that doing something
kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> Herta<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.340> Tom<00:01:20.580> -<00:01:20.820> Tom<00:01:21.090> -

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
kind of like the Herta from Tom - Tom -

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
kind of like the Herta from Tom - Tom -
Tom<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:22.409> hands<00:01:22.799> could<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.369> bit

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
Tom my hands could get a little bit

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.539 
Tom my hands could get a little bit
confused<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.720> practice<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.740> would<00:01:26.340> say

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
confused so practice this I would say

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.039 
confused so practice this I would say
from<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> snare<00:01:27.180> -<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> each<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> your

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
from the snare - that to each of your

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.830 
from the snare - that to each of your
toms<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.860> kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.130> help<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.210> body<00:01:30.450> learn

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.630 

now<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:11.080> fundamental<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:12.489> like

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
now the fundamental of this is just like

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.190 
now the fundamental of this is just like
I<00:02:12.910> told<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.239> before<00:02:13.330> right<00:02:13.750> left<00:02:13.959> right<00:02:14.019> left

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I told you before right left right left

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.199 
I told you before right left right left
right<00:02:14.650> left<00:02:14.860> right<00:02:15.099> left<00:02:15.370> right<00:02:15.790> left<00:02:15.940> right

right left right left right left right

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:38.039 
right left right left right left right
left<00:02:16.360> okay<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:19.959> slow<00:02:20.260> now<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.750> may<00:02:37.900> not

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
left okay so do it slow now you may not

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.539 
left okay so do it slow now you may not
think<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.620> need<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.860> practice<00:02:39.069> this

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
think that you need to practice this

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.039 
think that you need to practice this
because<00:02:39.850> oh<00:02:40.000> whatever<00:02:40.239> it's<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.600> single

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
because oh whatever it's just single

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.900 
because oh whatever it's just single
stroke<00:02:41.319> hand<00:02:41.680> rolls<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:42.519> that<00:02:42.700> no

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
stroke hand rolls I can do that no

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.809 
stroke hand rolls I can do that no
problem<00:02:43.049> but<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.290> trick<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:44.799> getting<00:02:45.250> to

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
problem but the trick is getting to

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.289 
problem but the trick is getting to
navigate<00:02:46.330> all<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.930> your<00:02:47.049> Tom's<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.769> doing<00:02:48.130> it

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
navigate all of your Tom's in doing it

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.340 
navigate all of your Tom's in doing it
it<00:02:49.299> may<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.510> something<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.019> may<00:02:50.200> not

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
it may be something that you may not

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.840 
it may be something that you may not
even<00:02:50.470> think<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.920> need<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.250> practice<00:02:51.430> but

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
even think that you need to practice but

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.870 
even think that you need to practice but
give<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> shot<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.410> if<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.370> when<00:02:54.640> going

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
give it a shot and if if you when going

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.720 
give it a shot and if if you when going
from<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.420> snare<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.079> Tom<00:02:56.380> start<00:02:57.370> even

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
from the snare to the Tom start even

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.460 
from the snare to the Tom start even
kind<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.030> flubbing<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.570> little<00:02:58.840> bit<00:02:58.989> then<00:02:59.230> maybe

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
kind of flubbing a little bit then maybe

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.990 
kind of flubbing a little bit then maybe
it's<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.010> little<00:03:00.310> bit<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.549> chink<00:03:00.850> in

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
it's like a little bit of a chink in

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.370 
it's like a little bit of a chink in
your<00:03:01.060> armor<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.630> need<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.840> kind<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.109> like<00:03:02.260> you
