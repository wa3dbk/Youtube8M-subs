00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hi, people today, I'll do it if there is any 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.929
 nail is super easy to make 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.809
 It's to the base of the nail I've painted with this 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.630
 enamel that is the pearl of risque that is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.240
 a sparkling rose very bright and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 make the bow 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.199
 I'm going to use the impala pink which is a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:35.250
 light pink too it's not too dark 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:38.640
 and I will use the scorer and to do those 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.850
 here larger balls or you use the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.520
 goleador's way even then you use 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.190
 one tries the ball only the one that is extinct 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.430
 ball which is handicraft but also 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.800
 serves that it has here several sizes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 balls and these neat appliques here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.320
 I'm going to use pink where pink balls are there 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.150
 to make put some of the enamel 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.150
 darker on paper 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:17.960
 then I'll get here with the butt 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 brush even looking to make a ball 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.780
 it's full here 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.720
 there, side by side 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:46.789
 So I like to leave a little bit to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:53.030
 he's only a little bit harder in the 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:55.039
 nail to pull I just came here with the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.950
 scorer who has this ball well 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.780
 little can do with toothpick 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:12.910
 also here it picks up from the middle of the ball and 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.910
 pull recess from the middle of the center 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.360
 now just make a little ball in the middle 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:46.020
 I picked up the straws and I live here at the base only 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.820
 to pick up the applique will get more 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.820
 easy to get the apply here 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.409
 so here they come in the ball and hit 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.409
 here in the middle 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.930
 Ready's it 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.439
 I'll make one more for you to see. 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.439
 new 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.349
 That's it, that's when I get well. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.310
 only the extra brightness 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.250
 top 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.739
