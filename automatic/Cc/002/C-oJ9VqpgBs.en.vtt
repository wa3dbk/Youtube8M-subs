 welcome click on that subscriber 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.070
 but today I review and the new one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.500
 spanish movies pangloss in action the series 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.789
 Paris has been running since 2007 and it is now 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 pass the second 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.910
 span has film the much heard exciting 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.890
 college 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 Groenlo it comes down to it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 spangalis college is busy and the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.399
 students are of course absolutely not 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.469
 happy with, therefore, a handful of the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.440
 pupils usually building 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.239
 occupy and this kind of course for it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 that there is a bit of a struggle 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.870
 between that group of friends because not 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 everyone agrees for how it is 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 things are going how it happened but I 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.079
 you are not going to tell how it ends 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.680
 but tell why you are belgian 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.719
 film should this km strong opening to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 my idea is nice feel it is modern 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.439
 a little after movie from the festival 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 no by the way so yes a bit crazy 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.280
 I mean a fat party 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
 anyway, I think the end of the film but 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.900
 tasty so bit modern bit this is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.520
 well done and at the same time I think so 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950
 quite nicely written for the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.900
 target teenagers 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.210
 but and that childlike action and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.250
 at the same time it also bit romance so what 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 that it is good ingredients for one 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.460
 nice extension on the sea 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.259
 but that is also the reason why 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 i would say don't go with this one 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.650
 if you don't like the syriers and also nothing 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.470
 with the characters of the spangalis 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.950
 college what the fork and you how you 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.479
 that those guys lose a school 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.220
 it took a moment to think about it briefly 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.680
 I will still do quite a bit with some film 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.510
 questions are, for example, why must 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 bought the school 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.890
 on the one hand, why does mismatch know? 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.090
 that is hong because she is bought 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.460
 tells the new but at the same time this 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.400
 most of it nothing 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.080
 where is the real director is the interim 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.120
 director warm has come 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.190
 It is very clear that I like the series 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.050
 not full they are all small 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.240
 things which I afterwards pressure 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.430
 too bad but still do not want to complete it 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.940
 is what fun heart makes it for me 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.820
 if no clasp gasco there not that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.680
 chef of but I definitely think for the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.300
 target group and for the Spanish 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.040
 viewers really awfully nice 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.770
