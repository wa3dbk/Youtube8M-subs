00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.090 
mail well it was given the gold medal
right<00:03:55.020> now<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.560> will<00:03:55.620> just<00:03:55.680> give<00:03:55.920> him<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
right now it will just give him the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.500 
right now it will just give him the
world<00:03:56.280> record<00:03:56.670> in<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.820> silver<00:03:57.120> medal<00:03:57.330> that's

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
world record in the silver medal that's

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.000 
world record in the silver medal that's
right<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:57.870> only<00:03:58.110> one<00:03:58.380> seventy<00:03:58.740> seven

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
right because only one seventy seven

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.940 
right because only one seventy seven
point<00:03:59.160> five<00:03:59.430> counts<00:03:59.960> so<00:04:00.960> this<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.920> just

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
point five counts so this really is just

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.680 
point five counts so this really is just
to<00:04:02.220> keep<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.760> competition<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.540> who

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
to keep in that competition with who

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.930 
to keep in that competition with who
stir<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.830> big<00:04:07.980> champion<00:04:08.430> really<00:04:08.640> under

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
stir the big champion really under

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.600 
stir the big champion really under
pressure<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.740> looks<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.040> me<00:04:14.070> as<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.340> miss

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
pressure and it looks to me as if miss

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.520 
pressure and it looks to me as if miss
covets<00:04:14.940> will<00:04:15.120> probably<00:04:15.510> take<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.900> bronze

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
covets will probably take the bronze

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.110 
covets will probably take the bronze
because<00:04:16.890> he's<00:04:17.070> got<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.370> lightest<00:04:17.730> weight<00:04:17.910> of

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
because he's got the lightest weight of

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:30.680 
because he's got the lightest weight of
the<00:04:18.560> 175<00:04:19.560> s<00:04:23.300> Dimas<00:04:28.490> little<00:04:29.690> characteristic

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
the 175 s Dimas little characteristic

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
the 175 s Dimas little characteristic
look

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
look

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.549 
look
device

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:35.559 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:37.949 

now<00:04:35.859> we're<00:04:36.159> going<00:04:36.249> to<00:04:36.309> have<00:04:36.429> a<00:04:36.489> contest<00:04:36.899> now<00:04:37.899> we

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:37.959 
now we're going to have a contest now we

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:42.089 
now we're going to have a contest now we
really<00:04:38.349> have<00:04:38.619> got<00:04:38.799> to<00:04:38.859> contest<00:04:40.049> 178<00:04:41.049> it<00:04:41.979> will

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
really have got to contest 178 it will

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.059 
really have got to contest 178 it will
only<00:04:42.249> count<00:04:42.519> as<00:04:42.759> one<00:04:42.819> 77<00:04:43.479> and<00:04:43.899> a<00:04:43.929> half<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.889> take

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
only count as one 77 and a half to take

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.349 
only count as one 77 and a half to take
forward<00:04:45.369> to<00:04:45.549> the<00:04:45.639> clean-and-jerk<00:04:45.849> which

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:46.359 
forward to the clean-and-jerk which

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:49.109 
forward to the clean-and-jerk which
means<00:04:46.599> that<00:04:46.809> mark<00:04:46.989> justo<00:04:47.469> is<00:04:47.669> within<00:04:48.669> two<00:04:49.089> and

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:49.119 
means that mark justo is within two and

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:50.059 
means that mark justo is within two and
a<00:04:49.329> half<00:04:49.449> kilos

a half kilos

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.109 
a half kilos
so<00:04:51.069> the<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.889> fight<00:04:54.159> is<00:04:54.369> really<00:04:54.399> on<00:04:54.849> and

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:55.119 
so the the fight is really on and

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.809
