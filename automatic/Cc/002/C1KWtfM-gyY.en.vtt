00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
for blocks I'm going to show you how to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
for blocks I'm going to show you how to
do<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.549> ladder<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> figure<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:07.049> I'm

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
do the ladder right now I figure if I'm

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.550 
do the ladder right now I figure if I'm
doing<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.680> might<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.189> I'll<00:01:08.340> show<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.729> views<00:01:09.560> load

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
doing a might as I'll show it views load

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
doing a might as I'll show it views load
a<00:01:10.590> picture<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.130> views<00:01:11.400> select<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
a picture for all views select the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.109 
a picture for all views select the
ladder<00:01:12.390> open<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> follow<00:01:14.460> along<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.939> home

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
ladder open you can follow along at home

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.100 
ladder open you can follow along at home
mmm<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.430> watch<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.540> could

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
mmm don't do that just watch you could

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.749 
mmm don't do that just watch you could
do<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.290> later<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> image<00:01:20.520> loads

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
do that later when the image loads

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.600 
do that later when the image loads
you're<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> top<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> left<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you're going to see a top a left and a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.649 
you're going to see a top a left and a
front<00:01:23.939> view<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.380> ladder<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.450> will<00:01:27.570> be

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
front view of the ladder as it will be

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.149 
front view of the ladder as it will be
displayed<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> same<00:01:28.770> texture

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
displayed now you see the same texture

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
displayed now you see the same texture
because<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.880> separate<00:01:30.329> textures

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
because I don't have separate textures

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
because I don't have separate textures
for<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> ladder<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.130> load<00:01:32.250> separate

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
for the ladder but you can load separate

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.069 
for the ladder but you can load separate
textures<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.150> each<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.960> what

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
textures in each one of these for what

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.510 
textures in each one of these for what
to<00:01:34.200> use<00:01:34.409> today<00:01:34.829> I'm<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> use<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to use today I'm just going to use the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
to use today I'm just going to use the
texture<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.939> had<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.290> select<00:01:37.590> add<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> cube

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
texture we had and you select add a cube

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.480 
texture we had and you select add a cube
and<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.320> left-click<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.500> drag<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.220> click

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
and you left-click to drag right click
to<00:01:41.640> expand<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:43.049> create<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.829> cubes<00:01:45.049> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to expand and you create these cubes and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.420 
to expand and you create these cubes and
place<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.560> over<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> texture<00:01:47.250> where

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
place them over the texture where

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.670 
place them over the texture where
they're<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.119> grab<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.049> texture<00:01:49.470> from

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
they're going to grab the texture from

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.069 
they're going to grab the texture from
it's<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> easiest<00:01:50.280> way<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.750> begin

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it's just the easiest way to to begin

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's just the easiest way to to begin
and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.369> from<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> top<00:01:53.909> down<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and I don't want from the top down I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
and I don't want from the top down I
don't<00:01:54.479> want<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> ladder<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.920> out

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
don't want the ladder to actually be out

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.620 
don't want the ladder to actually be out
in<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> middle<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> block<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.420> I'm<00:01:57.509> going

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
in the middle of the block so I'm going

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.590 
in the middle of the block so I'm going
to<00:01:57.689> drag<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.860> rails<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.640> they're<00:02:00.450> going

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
to drag the the rails as they're going

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
to drag the the rails as they're going
to<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.469> way<00:02:01.590> against<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> back<00:02:02.310> edge

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
to be all the way against the back edge

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.980 
to be all the way against the back edge
I<00:02:02.729> don't<00:02:02.939> actually<00:02:03.060> want<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> rails<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.869> be

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
I don't actually want the rails to be

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.859 
I don't actually want the rails to be
thin<00:02:04.350> either<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> I'm<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> move<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.659> up

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
thin either so I'm going to move them up

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.630 
thin either so I'm going to move them up
and<00:02:07.670> expand<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.430> we

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and expand them like that so that we

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
and expand them like that so that we
have<00:02:11.879> some<00:02:12.480> decently<00:02:13.050> large<00:02:13.379> rail

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
have some decently large rail

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.020 
have some decently large rail
and<00:02:14.990> we'll<00:02:15.990> add<00:02:16.140> some<00:02:17.010> more<00:02:17.250> cubes<00:02:17.550> form<00:02:17.880> our

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
and we'll add some more cubes form our

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.870 
and we'll add some more cubes form our
cubes<00:02:18.470> for<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.709> rungs<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.459> I'm<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.700> going<00:02:20.819> to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
cubes for the rungs so I'm just going to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.960 
cubes for the rungs so I'm just going to
put<00:02:21.060> them<00:02:21.209> here<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:23.989> here<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.550> I'm<00:02:26.550> going<00:02:26.730> all

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
put them here and here and I'm going all

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.520 
put them here and here and I'm going all
off<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.300> front<00:02:27.569> view<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:28.080> that's<00:02:28.200> what

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
off the front view because that's what

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.400 
off the front view because that's what
the<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:29.790> are<00:02:30.060> used<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> seeing<00:02:31.170> when<00:02:31.260> we're

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the we are used to seeing when we're

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.890 
the we are used to seeing when we're
looking<00:02:31.530> at<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.800> ladder<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:33.150> entire<00:02:33.450> texture

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
looking at a ladder the entire texture

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.900 
looking at a ladder the entire texture
just<00:02:34.110> from<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.410> front<00:02:34.650> side<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:35.880> see

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
just from the front side and you can see

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.460 
just from the front side and you can see
here<00:02:36.270> on<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> top<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.959> left<00:02:37.050> side

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
here on the top and on the left side

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.780 
here on the top and on the left side
we've<00:02:37.680> got<00:02:37.830> those<00:02:37.980> rungs<00:02:38.250> out<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.580> middle

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
we've got those rungs out in the middle

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.940 
we've got those rungs out in the middle
so<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.090> need<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.330> move<00:02:39.450> them<00:02:39.690> back<00:02:40.140> I'm<00:02:40.830> going

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so we need to move them back I'm going

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.100 
so we need to move them back I'm going
to<00:02:41.010> put<00:02:41.069> them<00:02:41.280> right<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.730> middle<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:42.300> those

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
to put them right in the middle of those

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.340 
to put them right in the middle of those
rails<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.769> created<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:46.019> can<00:02:46.050> see

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
rails that we created and you can see

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.809 
rails that we created and you can see
the<00:02:46.470> entire<00:02:46.769> thing<00:02:46.830> happening<00:02:47.459> down<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
the entire thing happening down in the

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.090 
the entire thing happening down in the
bottom<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.209> hand<00:02:48.239> corner<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.980> what<00:02:49.980> we're

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
bottom right hand corner and what we're

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.309 
bottom right hand corner and what we're
left<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> good<00:02:50.850> 3d<00:02:51.209> model<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
left with is a good 3d model of the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.350 
left with is a good 3d model of the
ladder<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.799> we'll<00:02:53.160> see<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.459> game<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:53.880> if<00:02:54.180> you

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
ladder as we'll see it in game so if you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.789 
ladder as we'll see it in game so if you
have<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> pro<00:02:54.720> version<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.140> control<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
have the pro version you control and

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.729 
have the pro version you control and
shift<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.370> then<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.880> click<00:02:57.060> on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.209> camera

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
shift and then you click on the camera

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.380 
shift and then you click on the camera
you<00:02:58.739> can<00:02:58.890> actually<00:02:59.040> move<00:02:59.459> around<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.150> see

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
you can actually move around and see

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.580 
you can actually move around and see
what<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.959> look<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.319> when<00:03:01.500> you're

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
what it's going to look like when you're

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.580 
what it's going to look like when you're
done<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:02.670> I'm<00:03:03.239> pretty<00:03:03.720> satisfied<00:03:04.319> with<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.530> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
done so I'm pretty satisfied with that I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.620 
done so I'm pretty satisfied with that I
think<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.860> rungs<00:03:05.069> are<00:03:05.280> away<00:03:05.640> from<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.150> back

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
think the rungs are away from the back

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.539 
think the rungs are away from the back
wall<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.260> kind<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.160> middle<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
wall I kind of in the middle of the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.690 
wall I kind of in the middle of the
block<00:03:08.760> that's<00:03:09.630> good<00:03:09.900> I'm<00:03:10.799> sad<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.670> I

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
block that's good I'm sad I like that I

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.570 
block that's good I'm sad I like that I
like<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.690> problem<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.230> now<00:03:13.980> these<00:03:14.280> rungs

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
like that the problem is now these rungs

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.250 
like that the problem is now these rungs
are<00:03:14.819> too<00:03:15.030> thin<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.450> grab<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.810> entire<00:03:16.230> texture

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
are too thin to grab the entire texture

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.599 
are too thin to grab the entire texture
here<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.470> going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.680> only<00:03:19.829> grab<00:03:20.130> like<00:03:20.370> I

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
here it's going to only grab like I

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.750 
here it's going to only grab like I
guess<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.359> middle<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:23.130> along<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.730> edge

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
guess the middle of just along the edge

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.640 
guess the middle of just along the edge
of<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.630> dot<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.170> want<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.500> grab

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
of this this dot and I want it to grab

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.410 
of this this dot and I want it to grab
this<00:03:25.859> entire<00:03:26.160> texture<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.730> maybe<00:03:26.880> smoosh<00:03:27.209> it

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
this entire texture and maybe smoosh it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.229 
this entire texture and maybe smoosh it
well<00:03:28.200> sphax<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:28.980> did<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:29.489> easy<00:03:29.670> method<00:03:30.150> of

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
well sphax I did a really easy method of

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.660 
well sphax I did a really easy method of
doing<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.890> click<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.430> rail

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
doing that you just click on the rail

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.599 
doing that you just click on the rail
and<00:03:33.230> on<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.560> UV<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.370> going<00:03:35.549> to

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
and on the UV and this is going to

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.190 
and on the UV and this is going to
actually<00:03:35.730> let<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.209> assign<00:03:36.600> where<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.959> want

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
actually let you assign where you want

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.680 
actually let you assign where you want
it<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.410> grab<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.859> texture<00:03:38.280> from<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.760> then<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
it to grab the texture from and then you

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.569 
it to grab the texture from and then you
left-click<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.230> move<00:03:40.560> right<00:03:40.920> click<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.280> drag

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
left-click to move right click to drag

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.610 
left-click to move right click to drag
and<00:03:41.850> what<00:03:42.540> I'm<00:03:42.630> doing<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.989> I'm<00:03:43.200> telling<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.530> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and what I'm doing is I'm telling it to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.960 
and what I'm doing is I'm telling it to
grab<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.950> entire<00:03:44.510> rail<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.400> then<00:03:47.400> smoosh<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
grab the entire rail and then smoosh the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.970 
grab the entire rail and then smoosh the
texture<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.600> then<00:03:49.380> I'm<00:03:49.500> going<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.680> tell<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:49.950> to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
texture and then I'm going to tell it to

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.300 
texture and then I'm going to tell it to
grab<00:03:50.340> these<00:03:50.579> little<00:03:50.940> pips<00:03:51.799> for<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.920> top<00:03:53.130> and

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
grab these little pips for the top and

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.160 
grab these little pips for the top and
the<00:03:53.370> bottom<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.600> when<00:03:54.870> you're<00:03:54.989> looking

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
the bottom so that when you're looking

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.240 
the bottom so that when you're looking
at<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.410> top<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.739> bottom<00:03:55.950> it's<00:03:56.070> going<00:03:56.160> to

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
at the top of the bottom it's going to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.590 
at the top of the bottom it's going to
look<00:03:56.310> like<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.609> little<00:03:56.819> square<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.239> right

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
look like that little square like right

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.390 
look like that little square like right
there<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:57.989> I'm<00:03:58.739> going<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.890> do<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.069> same

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
there and I'm going to do that same

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
there and I'm going to do that same
thing<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.880> the<00:03:59.970> other<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:01.730> top<00:04:03.470> bottom<00:04:04.470> left

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
thing for the other one top bottom left

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.330 
thing for the other one top bottom left
side<00:04:06.420> right<00:04:07.760> side<00:04:09.680> okay<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.010> those<00:04:11.190> two

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
side right side okay and so those two

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.860 
side right side okay and so those two
are<00:04:11.430> done<00:04:11.579> now<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.120> rungs

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
are done now the rungs

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.860 
are done now the rungs
I<00:04:12.989> don't<00:04:13.290> want<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.500> grabbing<00:04:13.889> some<00:04:14.190> random

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
I don't want it grabbing some random

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.150 
I don't want it grabbing some random
section<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.959> no<00:04:16.109> texture<00:04:16.500> down<00:04:16.680> here<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.070> I'm

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
section of no texture down here so I'm

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.550 
section of no texture down here so I'm
going<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.340> click<00:04:17.549> on<00:04:17.669> each<00:04:17.700> rung<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.690> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
going to click on each rung and the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.960 
going to click on each rung and the
sides<00:04:19.829> don't<00:04:20.070> really<00:04:20.340> matter<00:04:20.519> that's<00:04:20.820> what

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
sides don't really matter that's what

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.760 
sides don't really matter that's what
the<00:04:21.090> red<00:04:21.269> sections<00:04:21.660> are<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.200> green<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770

bottom view so that's what I'm going to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.560 
bottom view so that's what I'm going to
do<00:04:33.450> I'm<00:04:33.630> just<00:04:33.690> going<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:33.960> move<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.490> drag<00:04:35.490> it

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
do I'm just going to move it drag it

do I'm just going to move it drag it
move<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.750> drag<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.800> awesome<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.620> I'm<00:04:40.710> going<00:04:40.830> to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
move it drag it awesome so I'm going to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.260 
move it drag it awesome so I'm going to
do<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.100> for<00:04:41.220> all<00:04:41.280> four<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.580> these<00:04:41.790> now

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
do that for all four of these now

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.180 
do that for all four of these now
something<00:04:42.720> that's<00:04:42.750> really<00:04:43.169> cool<00:04:43.350> is<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.560> for

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
something that's really cool is that for

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.400 
something that's really cool is that for
now<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:45.060> grid<00:04:45.630> snaps<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.230> 32<00:04:46.680> by<00:04:46.860> 32<00:04:48.410> pixels

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
now the grid snaps to a 32 by 32 pixels

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.680 
now the grid snaps to a 32 by 32 pixels
but<00:04:50.040> soon<00:04:50.400> he's<00:04:50.669> going<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.120> make<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:51.540> that

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
but soon he's going to make it so that

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.659 
but soon he's going to make it so that
you<00:04:51.750> can<00:04:51.900> select<00:04:52.080> even<00:04:52.440> more<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:53.430> you're<00:04:53.550> going

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
you can select even more so you're going

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.040 
you can select even more so you're going
to<00:04:53.700> be<00:04:53.790> able<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:53.970> do<00:04:54.060> those<00:04:54.180> high-res<00:04:54.600> textures

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
to be able to do those high-res textures

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.600 
to be able to do those high-res textures
that<00:04:55.080> you've<00:04:55.350> made<00:04:55.590> custom<00:04:55.830> for<00:04:56.070> maybe<00:04:56.400> your

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
that you've made custom for maybe your

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.480 
that you've made custom for maybe your
server<00:04:56.880> or<00:04:57.410> for<00:04:58.410> any<00:04:58.740> texture<00:04:59.130> pack<00:04:59.310> really

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
server or for any texture pack really

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.860 
server or for any texture pack really
and<00:04:59.790> you'll<00:04:59.880> be<00:05:00.000> able<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.210> go<00:05:00.300> into<00:05:00.510> here<00:05:00.660> and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and you'll be able to go into here and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.780 
and you'll be able to go into here and
make<00:05:01.080> your<00:05:01.410> own<00:05:01.530> 3d<00:05:01.800> models<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.340> these<00:05:02.460> blocks

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
make your own 3d models of these blocks

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.180 
make your own 3d models of these blocks
so<00:05:03.690> I've<00:05:04.080> got<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.410> textures<00:05:04.770> all<00:05:04.890> assigned

change<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.919> name<00:05:14.100> of<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.700> ladder<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.919> I

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
change the name of it to ladder and I

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.170 
change the name of it to ladder and I
don't<00:05:16.980> want<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:17.310> 3d<00:05:17.610> rendering<00:05:18.000> in<00:05:18.090> the

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
don't want it 3d rendering in the

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.760 
don't want it 3d rendering in the
inventory<00:05:18.660> so<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.110> doesn't<00:05:19.470> slow<00:05:19.620> us<00:05:19.740> down

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
inventory so it doesn't slow us down

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.230 
inventory so it doesn't slow us down
we're<00:05:20.100> going<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.280> just<00:05:20.400> turn<00:05:20.669> that<00:05:20.729> off<00:05:20.910> we're

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
we're going to just turn that off we're

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.090 
we're going to just turn that off we're
going<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.390> type<00:05:21.720> ladder<00:05:22.110> in<00:05:22.320> there<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:22.680> hit<00:05:22.770> OK

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
going to type ladder in there and hit OK

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.320 
going to type ladder in there and hit OK
and<00:05:23.280> then<00:05:24.060> we're<00:05:24.240> going<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.410> file<00:05:25.410> export

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
and then we're going to file export

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.409 
and then we're going to file export

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
going to go into meshes and you got to

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.570 
going to go into meshes and you got to
create<00:06:15.360> each<00:06:15.510> of<00:06:15.630> those<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:16.430> once<00:06:17.430> you're

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
create each of those and once you're

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.570 
create each of those and once you're
inside<00:06:17.729> of<00:06:18.000> Mesut<00:06:18.390> meshes<00:06:19.310> put<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.400> ladder

inside of Mesut meshes put the ladder

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.659 
inside of Mesut meshes put the ladder
JSON<00:06:21.360> there<00:06:23.479> okay<00:06:24.479> and<00:06:24.690> in<00:06:25.380> game<00:06:25.650> it<00:06:26.100> really

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
JSON there okay and in game it really

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.409 
JSON there okay and in game it really
should<00:06:27.330> just<00:06:27.360> be<00:06:27.690> as<00:06:28.110> easy<00:06:28.680> as<00:06:29.270> going<00:06:30.270> to<00:06:30.390> your

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
should just be as easy as going to your

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.070 
should just be as easy as going to your

this<00:06:38.300> actually<00:06:39.300> works

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
this actually works

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.110 
this actually works
because<00:06:40.710> this<00:06:41.710> is<00:06:41.920> literally<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.790> second
