short loud noises guys I've done this on

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010 
short loud noises guys I've done this on
my<00:00:34.410> other<00:00:34.620> channel<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:36.000> didn't<00:00:36.809> even<00:00:36.899> know

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
my other channel and I didn't even know

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.660 
my other channel and I didn't even know
what<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> hell<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.160> started<00:00:38.370> playing

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
what the hell was and I started playing

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.110 
what the hell was and I started playing
it<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.160> hilarious<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.700> highly

recommend after this you can watch that
to<00:00:45.000> play<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> better<00:00:46.200> idea<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to play through to get a better idea of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.200 
to play through to get a better idea of
what<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> games<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> link<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.030> in

anyway what you have to do as the
description<00:00:53.100> says<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.670> control<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> hot

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
description says is you control a hot

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.880 
description says is you control a hot
air<00:00:54.570> balloon<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
air balloon and you have to get that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
air balloon and you have to get that
over<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.820> top<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> buildings<00:00:57.750> without

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
over the top of buildings without

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.990 
over the top of buildings without
actually<00:00:58.649> taking<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.129> off<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> top<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
actually taking it off the top of the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720 
actually taking it off the top of the
screen<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.410> use<00:01:01.710> air<00:01:02.010> currents<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
screen and you use air currents to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.289 
screen and you use air currents to
actually<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.629> last<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.860> wind<00:01:05.549> blowing<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
actually do last the wind blowing to the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
actually do last the wind blowing to the
right<00:01:06.510> which<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> direction<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> always

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
right which is the direction you always

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.039 
right which is the direction you always
pretty<00:01:08.310> much<00:01:08.400> wanna<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.689> it'll<00:01:09.869> also

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
pretty much wanna go and then it'll also

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
pretty much wanna go and then it'll also
be<00:01:10.320> different<00:01:10.619> currents<00:01:11.189> blowing<00:01:11.520> left<00:01:11.760> which

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
be different currents blowing left which

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.090 
be different currents blowing left which
is<00:01:12.090> indicated<00:01:12.630> by<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> arrow<00:01:13.140> directions<00:01:13.799> on

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
is indicated by the arrow directions on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490 
is indicated by the arrow directions on

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.670 
the left side of the screen and guys
it's<00:01:17.030> King<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> knowing<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:19.110> you've<00:01:19.530> got

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it's King and knowing because you've got

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
it's King and knowing because you've got
to<00:01:19.799> build<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> momentum<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> wind

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to build up the momentum with the wind

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
to build up the momentum with the wind
current<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.049> direction<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> want

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
current that's going direction you want

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.950 
current that's going direction you want
to<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.490> generally<00:01:24.210> speaking<00:01:24.540> when<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to go but generally speaking when you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
to go but generally speaking when you
have<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.229> clear<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> top<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> building<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
have to clear the top of a building the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.039 
have to clear the top of a building the
wind<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.119> blowing<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> opposite

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
wind is blowing in the opposite

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.440 
wind is blowing in the opposite
direction<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.310> you've<00:01:29.460> got<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> gauge<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
direction so you've got to gauge the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.359 
direction so you've got to gauge the
momentum<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> you've<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> gauge<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
momentum and you've got a gauge the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.359 
momentum and you've got a gauge the
height<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.829> over<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> top

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
height to just see it get over the top

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
height to just see it get over the top
of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.579> building<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.470> by

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
of the building and you do that by

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.300 
of the building and you do that by
singing<00:01:38.520> making<00:01:39.060> noises<00:01:39.740> talking

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
singing making noises talking

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
singing making noises talking
whatever<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> want<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.390> mean<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.540> can't<00:01:42.869> say

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
whatever you want I mean I can't say
