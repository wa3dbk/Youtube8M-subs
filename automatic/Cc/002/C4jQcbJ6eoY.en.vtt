and back in when both rein aids are used

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.469 
and back in when both rein aids are used
together

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
together

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.410 
together
I<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:39.079> change<00:01:39.350> direction<00:01:40.210> lightly<00:01:41.210> and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
I can change direction lightly and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.469 
I can change direction lightly and
easily<00:01:42.369> once<00:01:43.369> again<00:01:43.759> it's<00:01:43.909> important<00:01:44.420> to

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
easily once again it's important to

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.209 
easily once again it's important to
remember<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.960> it's<00:01:45.229> not<00:01:45.319> your<00:01:45.710> leg<00:01:45.979> that

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
remember that it's not your leg that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.510 
remember that it's not your leg that
turns<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.789> horse<00:01:47.030> turns<00:01:47.869> are<00:01:48.079> about

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
turns the horse turns are about

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.219 
turns the horse turns are about
deceleration<00:01:49.600> decelerating<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.719> front<00:01:50.990> feet

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
deceleration decelerating the front feet

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.649 
deceleration decelerating the front feet
and<00:01:51.469> therefore<00:01:52.280> it's<00:01:52.520> solely<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.179> job<00:01:53.509> of

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
and therefore it's solely the job of

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.989 
and therefore it's solely the job of
your<00:01:53.810> reins<00:01:54.109> don't<00:01:55.069> use<00:01:55.280> your<00:01:55.460> legs<00:01:55.639> and<00:01:55.850> reins

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
your reins don't use your legs and reins

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.370 
your reins don't use your legs and reins

horses<00:01:58.249> find<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.670> really<00:01:59.090> difficult<00:01:59.719> to
