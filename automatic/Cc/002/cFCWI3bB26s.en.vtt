00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 all very good 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:10.080
 which you lost with a smile and lost 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:19.350
 do you talk that as long 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 do you read fans every play on 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 marinas and society but leaves its 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.220
 reaching islets knows what and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.560
 which clearly stands on the verge of success 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.039
 careers are happy but choose 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.039
 the threshold 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 probably dry yourself until you put 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:17.369
 which creates Astana itself which 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.369
 creates my 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:24.900
 Dusty then let him not get out yet 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 late to change your view of your world 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.400
 serve any moment that creates 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:41.430
 time listen to yourself 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.430
 let it be too late to change your 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.770
 who creates my 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:13.410
 stop time listen to yourself 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:15.860
 it is too late to change that creates 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.860
 the battle
