00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
okay so yet again I have done it my pipe

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.089 
okay so yet again I have done it my pipe
and<00:00:10.780> I'm<00:00:11.780> going<00:00:12.050> to<00:00:12.110> show<00:00:12.260> you<00:00:12.320> how<00:00:12.590> to<00:00:12.650> get<00:00:12.980> the

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
and I'm going to show you how to get the

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.679 
and I'm going to show you how to get the
dent<00:00:13.280> out<00:00:13.370> using<00:00:13.730> a<00:00:14.269> map<00:00:15.170> torch<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:16.689> little

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
dent out using a map torch and little

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.590 
dent out using a map torch and little
air<00:00:17.779> compressor<00:00:19.510> first<00:00:20.510> off<00:00:22.119> we<00:00:23.119> got<00:00:23.240> one<00:00:23.449> end

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
air compressor first off we got one end

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.099 
air compressor first off we got one end
cap<00:00:23.810> off<00:00:24.050> wire<00:00:24.830> tied<00:00:25.269> that<00:00:26.269> way<00:00:26.480> just<00:00:26.900> in<00:00:26.990> case

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
cap off wire tied that way just in case

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.130 
cap off wire tied that way just in case
it<00:00:27.260> pops<00:00:27.380> off<00:00:27.619> no<00:00:28.100> shooting<00:00:28.789> across<00:00:29.140> anywhere

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
it pops off no shooting across anywhere

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.240 
it pops off no shooting across anywhere
and<00:00:30.320> I<00:00:30.760> don't<00:00:31.760> think<00:00:31.939> or<00:00:32.269> kill<00:00:32.449> somebody<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
and I don't think or kill somebody and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.840 
and I don't think or kill somebody and
we've<00:00:34.250> got<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:34.790> same<00:00:34.970> on<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> other<00:00:35.239> end<00:00:35.510> only

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
we've got the same on the other end only

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.700 
we've got the same on the other end only
this<00:00:37.850> one<00:00:38.120> is<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:38.989> little<00:00:39.110> more<00:00:39.290> wire<00:00:39.500> tied

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
this one is a little more wire tied

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.380 
this one is a little more wire tied
because<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.040> popped<00:00:40.190> off<00:00:40.370> last<00:00:40.579> time

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
because it popped off last time

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.799 
because it popped off last time
it's<00:00:42.350> got<00:00:42.500> tire<00:00:42.710> valve<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.219> that<00:00:44.000> way<00:00:44.270> we

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
it's got tire valve in it that way we

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.970 
it's got tire valve in it that way we
don't<00:00:44.899> get<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:45.170> here<00:00:45.290> leaking<00:00:45.559> out<00:00:46.149> so<00:00:47.860> here<00:00:48.860> we

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
don't get in here leaking out so here we

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.959 
don't get in here leaking out so here we
go<00:00:49.090> we're<00:00:50.090> going<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.450> hook<00:00:51.020> it<00:00:51.170> up<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:54.820> pump<00:00:55.820> it

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
go we're going to hook it up to pump it

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:37.730 
go we're going to hook it up to pump it
up<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.420> about<00:00:58.539> 20<00:00:59.539> psi

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.490 

that<00:01:38.740> should<00:01:38.950> be<00:01:39.010> good<00:01:39.160> enough<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:43.500> comes

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
that should be good enough so now comes

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.450 
that should be good enough so now comes
the<00:01:44.620> fun<00:01:44.770> part<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.750> heat<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:48.040> can<00:01:48.220> get<00:01:48.340> this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
the fun part the heat if I can get this

00:01:48.460 --> 00:02:03.800 
the fun part the heat if I can get this
in<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.760> gray<00:01:49.180> area<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:01.050> I'm<00:02:02.050> doing<00:02:02.320> this

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
in this gray area now I'm doing this

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.100 
in this gray area now I'm doing this
you're<00:02:06.150> gonna<00:02:07.150> want<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.510> pay<00:02:07.630> attention<00:02:07.870> to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
you're gonna want to pay attention to

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.949 
you're gonna want to pay attention to
your<00:02:08.259> pressure<00:02:09.149> way<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.179> blew<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.479> off<00:02:10.660> last

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
your pressure way I blew it off last

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.810 
your pressure way I blew it off last
time<00:02:11.260> let's<00:02:11.770> build<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.190> 20<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.700> it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
time let's build it to 20 and it

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.730 
time let's build it to 20 and it
overheated<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.690> shot<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> pressure<00:02:14.380> up<00:02:14.590> for

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
overheated and shot the pressure up for

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.520 
overheated and shot the pressure up for
about<00:02:14.890> 50<00:02:15.520> blue<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.850> caps<00:02:16.090> right<00:02:16.360> off<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
about 50 blue the caps right off so you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.520 
about 50 blue the caps right off so you
got<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.010> be<00:02:18.100> careful<00:02:18.250> with<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.660> your

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
got to be careful with that and your

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.860 
got to be careful with that and your
more<00:02:20.860> yeah<00:02:21.610> you're<00:02:22.180> gonna<00:02:22.270> heat<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.540> until

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
more yeah you're gonna heat it until

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.770 
more yeah you're gonna heat it until
it's<00:02:22.989> glowing<00:02:23.530> red<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:27.360> watch<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.510> pop<00:02:28.630> right

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it's glowing red and watch it pop right

00:02:28.780 --> 00:05:11.690 
it's glowing red and watch it pop right
out

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:23.460 

put<00:05:12.700> up<00:05:12.910> another<00:05:13.180> five<00:05:13.510> pounds<00:05:13.870> just<00:05:14.320> cold<00:05:15.130> out

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.830

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
gigantic dent still probably got to work

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.330 
gigantic dent still probably got to work
out<00:06:25.720> the<00:06:25.810> little<00:06:26.020> things<00:06:26.050> but<00:06:26.590> it's<00:06:27.070> a<00:06:27.190> whole

lot<00:06:27.550> better<00:06:27.700> than<00:06:27.970> the<00:06:28.090> massive<00:06:28.390> thing<00:06:28.540> that

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
lot better than the massive thing that

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.640 
lot better than the massive thing that
was<00:06:28.810> in<00:06:28.930> there<00:06:29.050> before<00:06:29.170> so<00:06:30.070> yeah<00:06:31.530> hope<00:06:32.530> you
