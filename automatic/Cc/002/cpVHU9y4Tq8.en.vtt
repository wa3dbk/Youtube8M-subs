00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.440 
the way it looks on ps4 and Xbox one for
an<00:03:24.130> absolute<00:03:24.490> fact<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:25.060> doesn't<00:03:25.210> look<00:03:25.420> that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
an absolute fact it doesn't look that

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.600 
an absolute fact it doesn't look that
good<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.230> still<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.620> again<00:03:26.920> doesn't<00:03:27.190> look<00:03:27.400> too

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
good but still it again doesn't look too

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.100 
good but still it again doesn't look too
bad<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.970> looks<00:03:28.210> in<00:03:28.420> my<00:03:28.450> opinion<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:28.930> still

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
bad it looks in my opinion it's still

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.690 
bad it looks in my opinion it's still
got<00:03:29.260> good<00:03:29.410> graphics<00:03:29.860> especially<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
got good graphics especially the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.400 
got good graphics especially the
graphics<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.240> buildings<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> cars<00:03:31.930> I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
graphics on the buildings and the cars I

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.900 
graphics on the buildings and the cars I
think<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.010> looks<00:03:33.190> pretty<00:03:33.460> badass

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
think it looks pretty badass

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.150 
think it looks pretty badass
but<00:03:34.390> even<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.900> graphics<00:03:35.440> don't<00:03:35.650> make<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.830> game<00:03:36.130> I

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
but even so graphics don't make a game I

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.890 
but even so graphics don't make a game I
mean<00:03:36.370> look<00:03:36.520> at<00:03:36.580> minecraft<00:03:37.090> minecraft<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.720> just
