guitar<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.819> he<00:02:33.819> uses<00:02:34.090> light<00:02:34.269> strings<00:02:34.569> as<00:02:34.720> well

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
guitar and he uses light strings as well

guitar and he uses light strings as well
9<00:02:35.050> 242<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.830> string<00:02:36.069> tension<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.459> very<00:02:36.489> very

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
9 242 so the string tension is very very

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.630 
9 242 so the string tension is very very
low<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.319> wide<00:02:38.530> quite<00:02:38.890> flat<00:02:39.160> fingerboard

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
low it's a wide quite flat fingerboard

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.059 
low it's a wide quite flat fingerboard
it<00:02:40.239> was<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> very<00:02:40.480> short<00:02:40.660> neck<00:02:40.959> but<00:02:41.260> really

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
it was a very short neck but really

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.940 
it was a very short neck but really
really<00:02:42.190> fat<00:02:42.519> neck<00:02:42.760> it's<00:02:43.350> 26<00:02:44.350> millimeters<00:02:44.830> or

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
really fat neck it's 26 millimeters or

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.030 
really fat neck it's 26 millimeters or
than<00:02:45.040> up<00:02:45.160> there<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.580> really<00:02:45.760> really<00:02:46.090> deep

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
than up there so it's really really deep

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.289 
than up there so it's really really deep
some<00:02:48.040> interesting<00:02:48.370> points<00:02:48.670> about<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.060> from

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
some interesting points about it from

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.400 
some interesting points about it from
the<00:02:49.390> point<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.630> view<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.810> playing<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.319> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
the point of view of playing it the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.720 
the point of view of playing it the
trimmer<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.739> actually<00:02:50.830> works<00:02:51.100> very<00:02:51.160> well<00:02:51.340> much

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
trimmer I actually works very well much

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.640 
trimmer I actually works very well much
more<00:02:51.880> stable<00:02:52.030> than<00:02:52.239> any<00:02:52.420> strategem<00:02:53.410> low<00:02:53.560> or

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
more stable than any strategem low or

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.039 
more stable than any strategem low or
anything<00:02:53.830> I've<00:02:54.010> tried<00:02:54.810> probably<00:02:55.810> obviously

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
anything I've tried probably obviously

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.780 
anything I've tried probably obviously
because<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.410> rollers<00:02:56.739> but<00:02:57.310> also<00:02:57.430> because

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
because of the rollers but also because

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.039 
because of the rollers but also because
the<00:02:57.880> headstock<00:02:58.180> angle<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.569> actually<00:02:58.840> very

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
the headstock angle is actually very

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.470 
the headstock angle is actually very
very<00:02:59.200> shallow<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:00.940> there's<00:03:01.090> only<00:03:01.269> just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
very shallow and so there's only just

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.940 
very shallow and so there's only just
enough<00:03:01.989> downward<00:03:02.319> pressure<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.709> first

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
enough downward pressure on the first

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.430 
enough downward pressure on the first
fret<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.459> make<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.090> open<00:03:04.299> string<00:03:04.540> sound<00:03:04.780> but

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
fret to make the open string sound but

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.800 
fret to make the open string sound but
because<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:06.040> very<00:03:06.220> little<00:03:06.810> snake

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
because of that this very little snake

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.570 
because of that this very little snake
when<00:03:08.080> you're<00:03:08.410> using<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.040> term<00:03:09.160> life<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.489> you

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
when you're using the term life so you

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.100 
when you're using the term life so you
can<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.180> use<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.540> bar<00:03:10.690> quite<00:03:10.840> heavily

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
can you can use the bar quite heavily

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.289 
can you can use the bar quite heavily
into<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.860> doesn't<00:03:12.400> go<00:03:12.489> out<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.640> tune<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.060> just

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
into it doesn't go out of tune so just

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.110 
into it doesn't go out of tune so just
Elvis<00:03:13.570> tuning<00:03:13.870> very<00:03:14.049> well<00:03:14.940> there's<00:03:15.940> people

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
Elvis tuning very well there's people

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.520 
Elvis tuning very well there's people
would<00:03:16.299> worm<00:03:16.480> holes<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:16.930> bits<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.109> pieces<00:03:17.200> out

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
would worm holes and bits and pieces out

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.990 
would worm holes and bits and pieces out
which<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.920> believe<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.489> pretty<00:03:18.700> much<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:18.940> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
which I believe is pretty much like the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.210 
which I believe is pretty much like the
original<00:03:19.440> another<00:03:20.440> interesting<00:03:20.829> point<00:03:20.950> about

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
original another interesting point about

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.229 
original another interesting point about
the<00:03:21.370> original<00:03:21.640> guitar<00:03:21.730> which<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.090> lot<00:03:22.209> of

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
the original guitar which a lot of

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.280 
the original guitar which a lot of
people<00:03:22.420> don't<00:03:22.510> realize<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:23.049> actually<00:03:23.260> a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
people don't realize is it's actually a

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.860 
people don't realize is it's actually a

the<00:03:28.660> truss<00:03:28.840> rod<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.950> trust<00:03:30.310> would

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the truss rod in it the trust would

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.250 
the truss rod in it the trust would
anchor<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.359> he's<00:03:31.480> actually<00:03:31.630> threaded

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
anchor this and he's actually threaded

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.660 
anchor this and he's actually threaded
and<00:03:32.799> it's<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:32.980> bolt<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.340> goes<00:03:33.400> right<00:03:33.609> through

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
and it's a bolt that goes right through

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.830 
and it's a bolt that goes right through
the<00:03:33.790> body<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.150> then<00:03:34.269> that's<00:03:34.420> held<00:03:34.570> on<00:03:34.690> with<00:03:34.750> a

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.660 
the body and then that's held on with a
big<00:03:34.989> bolt<00:03:35.230> on<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.470> back<00:03:35.620> here<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:35.980> then<00:03:36.489> two

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
actually covering a little hole and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.599 
actually covering a little hole and
Brian<00:03:47.650> when<00:03:47.769> he<00:03:47.829> originally<00:03:47.950> maybe<00:03:48.250> Cattell<00:03:48.519> I

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
Brian when he originally maybe Cattell I

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.190 
Brian when he originally maybe Cattell I
had<00:03:48.730> an<00:03:48.850> active<00:03:49.120> preamp<00:03:49.299> in<00:03:49.540> which<00:03:49.810> he<00:03:49.989> didn't

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
had an active preamp in which he didn't

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.449 
had an active preamp in which he didn't
understand<00:03:50.560> also<00:03:50.709> took<00:03:50.889> it<00:03:51.100> out<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.430> just

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
understand also took it out and just

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.590 
understand also took it out and just
cover<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.850> hole<00:03:52.000> in<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.209> plate<00:03:52.239> where<00:03:52.569> the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
cover the hole in the plate where the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.759 
cover the hole in the plate where the
switch<00:03:52.810> wells<00:03:53.049> were<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.170> little<00:03:53.260> piece<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.530> tape

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
switch wells were a little piece of tape

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.770 
switch wells were a little piece of tape
and<00:03:54.010> say<00:03:54.970> I've<00:03:55.120> actually<00:03:55.269> made<00:03:55.569> it<00:03:55.690> pretty

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
and say I've actually made it pretty

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.940 
and say I've actually made it pretty
much<00:03:55.959> as<00:03:56.109> it<00:03:56.200> was<00:03:56.350> in<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.500> mid<00:03:56.620> eighties<00:03:56.920> so

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
much as it was in the mid eighties so

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.830 
much as it was in the mid eighties so
it's<00:03:57.370> got<00:03:57.519> plenty<00:03:57.639> of<00:03:57.790> wear<00:03:57.970> marks<00:03:58.329> because

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
it's got plenty of wear marks because

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.180 
it's got plenty of wear marks because
obviously<00:03:59.019> Brian<00:03:59.350> uses<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.709> six<00:03:59.889> minutes<00:04:00.130> to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
obviously Brian uses a six minutes to

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.699 
obviously Brian uses a six minutes to
play<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.840> kind<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.900> beating<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.290> finish<00:04:02.500> up<00:04:02.650> a

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
play and kind of beating the finish up a

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.920 
play and kind of beating the finish up a
little<00:04:02.859> bit<00:04:03.040> rounding<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.790> also<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.510> edges

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
little bit rounding and also the edges

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.300 
little bit rounding and also the edges
veneered<00:04:05.230> because<00:04:05.560> men<00:04:05.799> have<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> block<00:04:06.130> ball

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
veneered because men have a block ball

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.650 
veneered because men have a block ball
down<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.579> side<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.060> edge<00:04:07.329> it's<00:04:07.510> got<00:04:07.630> a

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
down the side that edge it's got a

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.170 
down the side that edge it's got a
mahogany<00:04:08.260> veneer<00:04:08.560> around<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.069> which<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.910> split

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
mahogany veneer around it which is split

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.910 
mahogany veneer around it which is split
and<00:04:10.359> he's<00:04:11.200> got<00:04:11.350> various<00:04:11.500> bits<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.769> tape

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
and he's got various bits of tape

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.130 
and he's got various bits of tape
holding<00:04:12.160> particular<00:04:12.850> bag<00:04:13.000> cracks<00:04:13.389> on

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
holding particular bag cracks on

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.870 
holding particular bag cracks on
so<00:04:14.650> what<00:04:14.800> actually<00:04:14.890> has<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.220> do<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.580> get<00:04:15.700> that

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
so what actually has to do to get that

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.610 
so what actually has to do to get that
effect<00:04:16.269> was<00:04:16.450> wasn't<00:04:17.079> actually<00:04:17.320> finished<00:04:17.590> I

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
effect was wasn't actually finished I

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.199 
effect was wasn't actually finished I
let<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.859> glue<00:04:18.040> dry<00:04:18.070> orbiting<00:04:18.820> much<00:04:19.060> my

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
let the glue dry orbiting much my

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.090 
let the glue dry orbiting much my
stepmother<00:04:19.600> here<00:04:19.810> on<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.560> once<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.829> black<00:04:21.070> I

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
stepmother here on and once a black I

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.920 
stepmother here on and once a black I
did<00:04:21.340> or<00:04:21.459> one<00:04:21.549> finished<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.000> all<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.420> they<00:04:22.780> went

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
did or one finished it all and they went

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.450 
did or one finished it all and they went
round<00:04:23.080> beat<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.680> with<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.830> rubber<00:04:23.980> mallet<00:04:24.100> to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
round beat it with a rubber mallet to

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.790 
round beat it with a rubber mallet to
get<00:04:24.640> it<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:24.850> split<00:04:25.480> that<00:04:25.660> beer<00:04:25.840> with<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.050> and

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
get it to split that beer with you and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:06:17.130 
get it to split that beer with you and
so

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140
