00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello today i present to you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.990
 she had abu say that this watch 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.840
 then developed by a society 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.540
 French even if the manufacture is not 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.469
 not in France it is very different from 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480
 what we can know about worlds 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 connected in its form first accepted 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
 against is very wide that goes despite everything 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.769
 rather fit wrists with 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 a very flattering style and design 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.720
 see in the menu and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 rather advanced features even though the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.210
 rate is the delay of the watch actually 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 cac was a little late on the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 competition and that some choices are 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.870
 called wiser after everyone there 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.870
 will 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 he will see or not benefits or 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.910
 cons 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.100
 so we'll start by going back to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.610
 departure up 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 so that's the basic screen with four 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.510
 icons in the corners the time and date 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.739
 we will be able to walk in lots of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.390
 things up and down we're going to be able 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.390
 personalize 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.180
 the icons 1 there I'll go small sms 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.620
 that I will be able to read hop I see 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.190
 well easily so the negation is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 very fluid 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.409
 that's the good news to see her 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.160
 all the mails that we will be able to open 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.890
 elect we will see twitter and facebook 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.290
 but from memory they are not connected 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.119
 but we have them well and then we have plenty 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.130
 of the application classified maps that will you 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.430
 allow to follow a route one 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.110
 even the management of music we go 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.940
 can trigger a photo shoot at 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.200
 distance even if the software is not 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.930
 extraordinary but it allows the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.080
 to do there we will be able to open the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.360
 remote files but it's not okay 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.920
 work that I have not connected the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.929
 pedometer game it includes a pedometer 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.770
 with fast years that the speed calories 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.470
 etc. 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.450
 we find twitter facebook the mails 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.250
 waiting for them the calendar calls them 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 so that's a little less interesting 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.649
 that it's really all that is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.360
 release of android in notification and so 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.740
 we have all this information there and all 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.900
 these elements that will be able 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.340
 appear on the watch so I 'm going 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.960
 show you try closely what it is 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.189
 gives a wrist the problem is that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.280
 I have a little pea related and that the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.530
 system used by lavea body but 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.420
 in quotation marks not compatible with my 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.870
 little handle just what I 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.400
 can not say it 100% because 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.630
 we use a system that can not 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.390
 go back further so that's it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.160
 gives the wrist so you can 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.540
 see here they used a system u 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.799
 is rather well thought out that allows 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.590
 to avoid getting caught in the head with a 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.440
 cable on the wrist that gives it the button 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.170
 is well placed at the bottom left here it is 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.590
 the only button and navigation is very 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.610
 fluid 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.710
 so we 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.390
 on paper this very interesting name 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.460
 who is going out shows that we have 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.700
 the habit of seeing the application is 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.200
 rather successful that allows to control the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.240
 operation and presto it works well 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.760
 my only little concern for me is the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.950
 size of the wrist size that I do not 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.510
 can not close but otherwise if you have 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.740
 a big handle you like big 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.170
 screen because it's actually a 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.110
 big screen and I think software is going 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.040
 evolve a bit in the coming months 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.780
 it's another interesting 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.080
 that was the presentation of lavea 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.080
 body
