00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
cylinder-shaped King this is the one

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:49.970 
cylinder-shaped King this is the one
that's<00:02:36.720> going<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.080> form<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> basic<00:02:37.709> garlic<00:02:48.980> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that's going to form the basic garlic to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.010 
that's going to form the basic garlic to
get<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.280> basic<00:02:50.580> garlic<00:02:50.910> shape<00:02:51.180> close<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.810> end

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
get the basic garlic shape close the end

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.350 
get the basic garlic shape close the end
of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> cane<00:02:52.739> cut<00:02:53.160> off<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.520> piece<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.030> close

the<00:02:54.510> other<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:54.930> will

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:17.460 

I<00:03:15.120> then<00:03:16.120> place<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.599> top<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.810> needle<00:03:17.260> tool

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
I then place it on top of needle tool

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.140 
I then place it on top of needle tool
and<00:03:17.500> use<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> coil<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.310> batting<00:03:18.700> tools<00:03:18.909> to

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
and use a coil of batting tools to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:04:08.130 
and use a coil of batting tools to
create<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.569> lines

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.660 

cut<00:04:09.140> off<00:04:09.290> some<00:04:09.530> thin<00:04:09.739> slices<00:04:10.189> of<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.459> first

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
cut off some thin slices of the first

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.160 
cut off some thin slices of the first
cane<00:04:10.909> and<00:04:11.090> add<00:04:11.180> these<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.599> garlic<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.140> make

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
cane and add these to the garlic to make

00:04:12.170 --> 00:05:01.239 
cane and add these to the garlic to make
them<00:04:12.439> look<00:04:12.560> more<00:04:12.620> flaky

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.519 

I<00:05:01.309> then<00:05:02.059> mix<00:05:02.299> the<00:05:02.509> end<00:05:02.629> pieces<00:05:02.869> from<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.289> cane

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:03.529 
I then mix the end pieces from the cane

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.409 
I then mix the end pieces from the cane
with<00:05:03.709> yellow<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.069> use<00:05:04.489> this<00:05:04.729> color<00:05:04.999> to<00:05:05.269> make

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
with yellow and use this color to make

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:27.790 
with yellow and use this color to make
the<00:05:05.449> individual<00:05:05.989> cloves

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.430 

now<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:29.190> lost<00:05:29.550> one<00:05:29.910> clip<00:05:30.330> basically<00:05:31.140> what<00:05:31.290> I<00:05:31.320> did

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440
