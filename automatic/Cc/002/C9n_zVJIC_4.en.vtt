I<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> idea<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.340> having<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.670> bigger

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
I just like the idea of having a bigger

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
I just like the idea of having a bigger
upper<00:01:27.900> body<00:01:28.140> type<00:01:28.470> thing<00:01:31.130> your<00:01:32.130> range<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
upper body type thing your range of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.969 
upper body type thing your range of
motion<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.420> bit<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.380> well<00:01:34.619> when

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
motion is a little bit not as well when

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
motion is a little bit not as well when
you<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.820> tending<00:01:36.210> garden<00:01:36.619> covered

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you have your tending garden covered

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.730 
you have your tending garden covered
like<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.119> mean<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.530> more

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
like this so I mean if you want more

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.130 
like this so I mean if you want more
mobility<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.400> would<00:01:41.880> recommend<00:01:42.299> doing<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and then just see if my range of motion

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.260 
and then just see if my range of motion
is<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> lot<00:01:48.659> better<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:50.000> like<00:01:51.000> but

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
kind of like imprint on it maybe that's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.860 
kind of like imprint on it maybe that's
when<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> full<00:02:26.850> tuck<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.660> maybe

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
when the full tuck so that can maybe

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.710 
when the full tuck so that can maybe
happen<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:29.490> might<00:02:29.700> were<00:02:29.880> down<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.360> your

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
happen but it might were down your your

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.210 
happen but it might were down your your
escape<00:02:32.240> tendon<00:02:33.240> guards<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.990> mean<00:02:34.740> as<00:02:35.040> long

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
escape tendon guards but I mean as long

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.800 
escape tendon guards but I mean as long
as<00:02:35.400> you're<00:02:35.550> not<00:02:35.640> going<00:02:35.910> too<00:02:36.180> crazy<00:02:36.390> you're

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
as you're not going too crazy you're

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.710 
as you're not going too crazy you're
really<00:02:37.110> flexing<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.880> yeah<00:02:38.880> it'll<00:02:39.150> probably<00:02:39.240> be

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
really flexing it yeah it'll probably be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.199 
really flexing it yeah it'll probably be
fine<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> pretty<00:02:41.610> old<00:02:41.850> skate

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
fine but this is a pretty old skate

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.930 
fine but this is a pretty old skate
tombstone<00:02:42.900> yeah<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> next<00:02:44.340> type<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.610> tuck

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
tombstone yeah so the next type of tuck

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.540 
tombstone yeah so the next type of tuck
I'm<00:02:45.090> going<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> show<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.220> tuck<00:02:47.220> on<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
I'm going to show you is the tuck on the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.020 
I'm going to show you is the tuck on the
tongue

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
tongue

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.290 
tongue
so<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.570> here<00:02:49.110> we<00:02:49.200> go<00:02:49.230> nice<00:02:49.530> right<00:02:49.770> here<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:54.090> this

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
so I here we go nice right here so this

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.120 
so I here we go nice right here so this
type<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> talking<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.350> most<00:02:55.560> common<00:02:56.040> in

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
type of talking is the most common in

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.000 
type of talking is the most common in
the<00:02:56.280> NHL<00:02:56.730> probably<00:02:57.570> because<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.320> range<00:02:58.860> of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the NHL probably because of the range of

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.180 
the NHL probably because of the range of
motion<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.700> when<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.500> when<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.680> use

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
motion you get when you when you use

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.890 
motion you get when you when you use
this<00:03:02.370> type<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.670> tuck<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.540> bend<00:03:03.720> this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
this type of tuck see I can bend this

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.750 
this type of tuck see I can bend this
all<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.170> way<00:03:04.290> back<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:05.310> really<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.730> know

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
all the way back can really you know

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.720 
all the way back can really you know
move<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.630> around<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.220> that's<00:03:08.220> probably<00:03:08.520> why

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
move it around so that's probably why

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.280 
move it around so that's probably why
it's<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.910> most<00:03:08.940> popular<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.989> probably

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
it's the most popular and it probably

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.010 
it's the most popular and it probably
has<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.340> most<00:03:11.370> advantages<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.510> by<00:03:12.810> giving

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
has the most advantages to it by giving

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.750 
has the most advantages to it by giving
you<00:03:13.260> more<00:03:13.470> range<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.040> motion<00:03:14.720> but<00:03:15.720> yeah<00:03:16.760> did

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you more range of motion but yeah did

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.039 
you more range of motion but yeah did
you<00:03:17.850> see<00:03:17.940> there<00:03:18.239> we<00:03:18.360> got<00:03:18.480> Sidney<00:03:18.840> Crosby

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
you see there we got Sidney Crosby

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.350 
you see there we got Sidney Crosby
probably<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.190> best<00:03:20.400> player<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.940> world

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
probably the best player in the world

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.570 
probably the best player in the world
and<00:03:21.980> he's<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> yeah<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:24.590> tuxedo<00:03:25.590> verision<00:03:25.950> which

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
and he's a yeah a tuxedo verision which

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.300 
and he's a yeah a tuxedo verision which
gives<00:03:26.820> them<00:03:26.940> better<00:03:27.200> mobility<00:03:28.200> now<00:03:28.920> I'm<00:03:29.130> going

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
gives them better mobility now I'm going

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.539 
gives them better mobility now I'm going
to<00:03:29.400> show<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:30.709> why<00:03:31.709> not<00:03:31.769> probably<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.400> most

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
to show you why not probably the most

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.640 
to show you why not probably the most
least<00:03:32.850> common<00:03:33.360> tuck<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> whole<00:03:34.440> game

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
least common tuck in the whole game

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.400 
least common tuck in the whole game
talking<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.670> back<00:03:35.850> tendon<00:03:36.330> guard<00:03:39.260> again<00:03:40.260> now

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
talking the back tendon guard again now

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.220 
talking the back tendon guard again now
just<00:03:40.709> like<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.890> full<00:03:41.760> tuck<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.630> will<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.049> won't

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
just like the full tuck it will it won't

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.800 
just like the full tuck it will it won't
give<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.620> as<00:03:43.890> much<00:03:44.190> mobility<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.600> will

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
give you as much mobility and it will

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.710 
give you as much mobility and it will
probably<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.410> will<00:03:46.590> not<00:03:47.120> affect<00:03:48.120> your<00:03:48.269> tendon

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
probably it will not affect your tendon

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.930 
probably it will not affect your tendon
guard<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.049> little<00:03:49.200> bit<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.830> my<00:03:50.100> word<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.519> but

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
guard a little bit so my word on but

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000 
guard a little bit so my word on but
it's<00:03:51.420> got<00:03:51.600> more<00:03:51.780> mobility<00:03:52.410> than<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> full

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it's got more mobility than the full

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.030 
it's got more mobility than the full
tuck<00:03:53.299> because<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.959> have<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.799> tongue

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
tuck because you have this your tongue

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.680 
tuck because you have this your tongue
is<00:03:56.190> more<00:03:56.370> free<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.299> yeah<00:03:58.970> also<00:03:59.970> one<00:04:00.390> really

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
is more free so yeah also one really

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.350 
is more free so yeah also one really
nice<00:04:00.840> advantage<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:02.700> terms<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.120> style

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
nice advantage of this in terms of style

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.020 
nice advantage of this in terms of style
is<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:04.110> can<00:04:04.260> get<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.530> nice<00:04:04.739> flop<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.459> you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
is you can get that nice flop and you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.660 
is you can get that nice flop and you
can<00:04:06.209> make<00:04:06.420> your<00:04:06.830> leg<00:04:07.830> look<00:04:07.860> like<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.430> bigger

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
can make your leg look like it's bigger

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.069 
can make your leg look like it's bigger
and<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.120> just<00:04:09.299> still<00:04:09.510> have<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.840> nice

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
and you can just still have that nice

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.920 
and you can just still have that nice
swap<00:04:10.440> in<00:04:10.620> there<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:11.250> couldn't<00:04:12.120> really<00:04:12.239> find<00:04:12.510> any

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
swap in there I couldn't really find any

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.140 
swap in there I couldn't really find any
NHL<00:04:13.590> hockey<00:04:13.739> players<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.400> do<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.670> back<00:04:14.850> tuck

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
NHL hockey players that do the back tuck

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.300 
NHL hockey players that do the back tuck
this<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.989> just<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.260> possibility<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.040> you

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
this is just a possibility that you

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.270 
this is just a possibility that you
could<00:04:17.459> do<00:04:18.049> but<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.109> know<00:04:19.590> it's<00:04:19.769> going<00:04:19.950> on<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
could do but I know it's going on to the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.990 
could do but I know it's going on to the
final<00:04:21.200> style<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.500> talking<00:04:23.130> your<00:04:23.490> hockey<00:04:23.640> sock

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
final style of talking your hockey sock

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.480 
final style of talking your hockey sock
fly<00:04:25.340> so

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
fly so

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.460 
fly so
all<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.270> really<00:04:27.300> have<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.690> do<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.229> flop

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
all you really have to do for a flop

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.150 
all you really have to do for a flop
skate<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:29.069> just<00:04:29.340> tuck<00:04:30.030> this<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.710> just<00:04:31.919> tuck

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
skate is just tuck this in and just tuck

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.240 
skate is just tuck this in and just tuck
the<00:04:32.400> everything<00:04:33.330> into<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.080> area<00:04:35.069> of<00:04:35.130> the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
the everything into the area of the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.240 
the everything into the area of the
opening<00:04:35.789> in<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:35.940> skate<00:04:36.509> now<00:04:36.780> flop<00:04:37.680> can<00:04:37.949> vary

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
opening in the skate now flop can vary

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.540 
opening in the skate now flop can vary
in<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.410> know<00:04:40.530> make<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.949> big<00:04:41.280> bigger

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
in you can you know make a big bigger

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.210 
in you can you know make a big bigger
flop<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.380> smaller<00:04:43.380> flap<00:04:43.680> what<00:04:43.889> you<00:04:44.009> have<00:04:44.099> to

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
flop and smaller flap what you have to

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.999 
flop and smaller flap what you have to
do<00:04:44.400> though<00:04:44.639> is<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:46.110> have<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.530> depends<00:04:46.919> on

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
do though is you have to it depends on

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.860 
do though is you have to it depends on
how<00:04:47.580> many<00:04:49.160> holes<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.580> skin<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.389> go

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
how many holes in the skin you you go

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.830 
how many holes in the skin you you go
through<00:04:52.199> so<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.759> more<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.360> higher<00:04:54.569> you

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
through so the the more the higher you

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.189 
through so the the more the higher you
grow<00:04:55.080> up<00:04:55.259> and<00:04:55.770> smaller<00:04:56.069> the<00:04:56.280> flock<00:04:56.580> will<00:04:56.819> be<00:04:57.199> so

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
grow up and smaller the flock will be so

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.620 
grow up and smaller the flock will be so
yeah<00:05:00.680> now<00:05:01.680> flop<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.580> pretty<00:05:02.970> much<00:05:03.150> if<00:05:03.330> you<00:05:03.449> want

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
yeah now flop is pretty much if you want

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.379 
yeah now flop is pretty much if you want
to<00:05:03.720> get<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:04.610> range<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.759> motion<00:05:06.120> this<00:05:06.210> is

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
to get a range of motion this is

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.230 
to get a range of motion this is
probably<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.990> second<00:05:07.409> best<00:05:07.590> option<00:05:08.240> because

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
probably the second best option because

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.779 
probably the second best option because
the<00:05:09.960> reason<00:05:10.259> why<00:05:10.409> is<00:05:10.470> because<00:05:10.680> your<00:05:11.280> shin<00:05:11.550> pad

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
the reason why is because your shin pad

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.719 
the reason why is because your shin pad
won't<00:05:12.030> interfere<00:05:12.330> with<00:05:12.630> your<00:05:12.900> tongue<00:05:13.199> so<00:05:14.069> the

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
won't interfere with your tongue so the

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.390 
won't interfere with your tongue so the
best<00:05:15.419> option<00:05:15.840> for<00:05:15.870> mobility<00:05:16.289> just<00:05:16.800> tucking

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
best option for mobility just tucking

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.890 
best option for mobility just tucking
this<00:05:17.699> over<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.120> tongue<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.509> then<00:05:18.630> leaving

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
this over the tongue and then leaving

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.700 
this over the tongue and then leaving
the<00:05:19.819> tendon<00:05:20.819> guard<00:05:21.090> alone<00:05:21.389> but<00:05:22.139> you<00:05:22.319> know<00:05:22.440> this

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
the tendon guard alone but you know this

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.379 
the tendon guard alone but you know this
is<00:05:22.860> whatever<00:05:23.069> you<00:05:23.460> want<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:23.849> whatever<00:05:23.970> you

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
is whatever you want and whatever you

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.210 
is whatever you want and whatever you
want<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.720> do<00:05:24.900> right<00:05:25.169> and<00:05:25.470> this<00:05:25.620> is<00:05:25.800> just<00:05:25.830> your

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
want to do right and this is just your

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.689 
want to do right and this is just your
style

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
style

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.930 
style
so<00:05:26.970> yeah<00:05:27.440> over<00:05:28.440> here<00:05:28.470> we<00:05:28.800> got<00:05:28.949> Ovechkin<00:05:29.729> which

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
so yeah over here we got Ovechkin which

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.870 
so yeah over here we got Ovechkin which
is<00:05:30.090> probably<00:05:30.509> one<00:05:30.780> of<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.020> best<00:05:31.830> players<00:05:32.159> that

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
is probably one of the best players that

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.120 
is probably one of the best players that
you<00:05:33.780> know<00:05:33.900> when<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.199> comes<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.469> style<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.979> know

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
you know when it comes to style you know

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.969
