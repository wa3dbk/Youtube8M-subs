00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
on the other team trihard so its just

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.350 
on the other team trihard so its just
trihard<00:00:32.759> trihard<00:00:33.540> filled<00:00:33.960> fun<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:36.000> score<00:00:36.239> is

trihard trihard filled fun the score is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
trihard trihard filled fun the score is
what<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.020> reflects<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> level<00:00:38.010> of

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
what it is it just reflects the level of

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.130 
what it is it just reflects the level of
competitiveness<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.719> team<00:00:39.899> deathmatch

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
competitiveness in this team deathmatch

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.889 
competitiveness in this team deathmatch
and<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.760> guess<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.570> adapt

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and this is I guess I just have to adapt

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
and this is I guess I just have to adapt
to<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.559> fine<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.520> I'm<00:00:44.610> using<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to it and that's fine so I'm using the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.170 
to it and that's fine so I'm using the
type<00:00:45.149> 25<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:46.590> red<00:00:47.160> dot<00:00:47.340> sight<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.910> believe

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
type 25 with red dot sight and I believe

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.750 
type 25 with red dot sight and I believe
quick<00:00:48.600> draw<00:00:48.870> either<00:00:49.050> quick<00:00:49.530> draw<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
quick draw either quick draw or the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850 
quick draw either quick draw or the
foregrip<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.260> quick<00:00:52.680> draw

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
foregrip I can not I think quick draw

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
foregrip I can not I think quick draw
yeah<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> very<00:00:54.420> nice<00:00:54.600> gun<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.989> reminds

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
yeah so it's a very nice gun it reminds

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.340 
yeah so it's a very nice gun it reminds
me<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.219> FAMAS<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:57.180> black<00:00:57.840> ops<00:00:58.079> 1

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
me a bit of the FAMAS from black ops 1

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.540 
me a bit of the FAMAS from black ops 1
just<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.829> initial<00:00:59.340> look<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:01.039> yeah<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
just a initial look of it and yeah it's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
just a initial look of it and yeah it's
just<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.969> ball<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.629> gun<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> unlock<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
just a ball out good gun you unlock it

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.010 
just a ball out good gun you unlock it
fairly<00:01:04.739> early<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> game<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.750> guess

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
fairly early in the game so I guess

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
fairly early in the game so I guess
that's<00:01:07.140> why<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> lot<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> people<00:01:07.680> use<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that's why a lot of people use it but I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.690 
that's why a lot of people use it but I
I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.470> most<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.310> guys<00:01:11.460> will

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

not<00:02:26.000> scar-h<00:02:26.750> use<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.230> pretty<00:02:27.470> decent

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
not scar-h use is pretty decent

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.860 
not scar-h use is pretty decent
especially<00:02:28.400> wood<00:02:28.520> for<00:02:28.760> grit<00:02:29.000> because<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.690> does

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
especially wood for grit because it does

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.670

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
kick a little bit at a distance so you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.500 
kick a little bit at a distance so you
may<00:02:33.950> even<00:02:33.980> find<00:02:34.430> yourself<00:02:34.880> losing<00:02:35.060> some
