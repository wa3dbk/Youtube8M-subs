00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello and all with you android 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.450
 android 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.090
 I had to record this video 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.460
 because I'm under my video today 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.410
 leave a comment which i will read 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.560
 and then I will say that I would like to know from you 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.410
 let's not write some Anton sorry 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.740
 skin read completely his text oh my god 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.390
 This is an epic Fail to buy Gold for Gold I 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.730
 I understand you had a premium account 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.679
 be lifelong and all premium tanks and you 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 I do not know where to put this unfortunate gold 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.340
 but spend for the season but spend for 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.719
 projectile having neither one nor the other 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.120
 shorter than the hand 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.280
 oh well would you be the only file salad 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.219
 though it was only the devil take the file 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.920
 well as the spool the like to 9 can be conducted if 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.079
 ride with the afterburner, I still understand to the heap 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.449
 carry though lotion very controversial obviously 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.090
 not for most tanks as well as you can 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.610
 I donâ€™t just carry it instead of a bird 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.379
 I understand how in the car instead of a set of keys 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 the same optically carry let's say 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.829
 balloon with helium and suddenly you need balls 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.640
 will make a laugh 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.080
 when you break a gun you repair it 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.939
 repair kit so why when contused 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.799
 loader you do not fly it with a first-aid kit 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.200
 because you have a fast and furious 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.020
 which is already spent at the beginning of the game 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.360
 trying to get the first crash before the mountains yet 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.080
 heaps and lots of files and physicists 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.509
 slightly less 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.939
 like about not penetration and you say ricochets 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.369
 didn't get it damn different things you call 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.520
 all TCP and dryers asu 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.470
 only cheese , etc. etc. I understand 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.299
 when you don't know much pen entering the game 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.979
 I understand some I understand some 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.180
 little things and the nuances do not know to pump 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.220
 to furnace equipment 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.140
 some things are individual until he himself 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.640
 try and not understand some 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.150
 directly depends on the class play style 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.680
 technology 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.409
 but damn it not to know some 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.570
 elementary basics it is strong it is 5 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.729
 look to start at least a video on 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.380
 the main game portal are those who 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.810
 laid out the developers in the copper section 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 I assure you will open a lot but without their words 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.950
 watched all your more than 30 years of play 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.729
 this start was fun getting to know yourself 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.710
 some moments 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.509
 as well as everything, well, hit at the top 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.469
 I think man only takes the first steps 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.079
 settle for time 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.000
 but it was, in general, was in 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.950
 general did not want to write anything not my 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.440
 style try to teach someone but honestly 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.060
 bombed when you gave affiliate program 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.710
 where the developers are apparently looking at him 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.660
 he rain with those very tight 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.700
 I ask only not trying to nick him what 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500
 teach until you learn and do not master 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.990
 times and basic basic concepts in the game 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.880
 not the basic things he's shorter than luck 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.530
 I can do everything ban bow I don't 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.980
 I am going to be quite constructive 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.780
 criticism I specifically shot this video for 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.100
 so that what do you think about 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.770
 about it all 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.280
 comment do you read right and not 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.590
 are right 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.480
 be sure to write in the comments in 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.810
 comments and and honestly here the mind is not 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.830
 read he read me wrote and I 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.200
 really went to the wiki for tanks some 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.850
