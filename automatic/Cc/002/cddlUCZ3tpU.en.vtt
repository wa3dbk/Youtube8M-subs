buried is not Samantha well if we look

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.229 
buried is not Samantha well if we look
at<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:37.980> faces<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> these<00:00:38.940> characters

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
at the two faces of these characters

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.869 
at the two faces of these characters
they<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:40.079> fairly<00:00:40.500> similar<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.309> share<00:00:41.550> some

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
they are fairly similar and share some

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
they are fairly similar and share some
resemblance<00:00:42.510> although<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.440> two

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
resemblance although these are two

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100 
resemblance although these are two
completely<00:00:44.129> different<00:00:44.850> people<00:00:45.079> samantha<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
completely different people samantha is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.470 
completely different people samantha is
of<00:00:46.350> course<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.829> daughter<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> Dr<00:00:47.760> Maxis<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
of course the daughter of Dr Maxis and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
of course the daughter of Dr Maxis and
we<00:00:48.629> believe<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> ghost<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.680> buried<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
we believe the ghost in buried is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
we believe the ghost in buried is
actually<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> wife<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.329> Michael<00:00:51.870> Faraday

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
actually the wife of Michael Faraday

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.470 
actually the wife of Michael Faraday
although<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.670> theory<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.239> not

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
although this is just a theory and not

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
although this is just a theory and not
confirmed<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.129> they

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
confirmed what we do know is they

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.779 
confirmed what we do know is they
probably<00:00:57.090> look<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:58.170> by<00:00:58.379> nature

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
probably look like because by nature

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
probably look like because by nature
