a<00:01:33.930> really<00:01:34.110> fun<00:01:34.440> new<00:01:34.590> way<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.740> play<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> game

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a really fun new way to play the game

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.740 
a really fun new way to play the game
because<00:01:35.550> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.120> emotions<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
because you can use your emotions to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.520 
because you can use your emotions to
achieve<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.080> bunch<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.440> different<00:01:37.770> things<00:01:39.530> we

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
achieve a bunch of different things we

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.100 
achieve a bunch of different things we
certainly<00:01:40.830> have<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.760> of<00:01:42.110> simulation

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
certainly have a lot of simulation

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.680 
certainly have a lot of simulation
happening<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.610> controlling<00:01:45.330> what<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
happening that is controlling what the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.600 
happening that is controlling what the
Sims<00:01:45.900> are<00:01:46.080> feeling<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.560> each<00:01:46.710> other<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.280> we

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
Sims are feeling about each other and we

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
Sims are feeling about each other and we
also<00:01:47.760> have<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.420> fun<00:01:48.930> new<00:01:49.140> system<00:01:49.470> in

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
also have this really fun new system in

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
also have this really fun new system in
the<00:01:49.620> game<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.979> allows<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.110> capture<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the game that allows you to capture a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
the game that allows you to capture a
moment<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.620> a<00:01:52.650> memory<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:53.340> assign<00:01:53.790> an

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
moment as a memory and then assign an

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760 
moment as a memory and then assign an
emotion<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.290> sim<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.650> then

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
emotion to it so your sim can then

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.680 
emotion to it so your sim can then
reminisce<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> memory<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.600> will

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
reminisce on that memory and it will

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.270 
reminisce on that memory and it will
make<00:01:57.840> them<00:01:58.049> feel<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.320> certain<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.220> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
make them feel a certain way so it's a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.760 
make them feel a certain way so it's a
lot<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> fun<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> say<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.420> forgot<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.650> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
lot of fun to say they forgot to do the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.399 
lot of fun to say they forgot to do the
dishes<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.369> make<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.760> memory<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
dishes you can make that a memory and

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.190 
dishes you can make that a memory and
and<00:02:03.549> assigned<00:02:04.549> emotion<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.119> like<00:02:05.420> anger

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and assigned emotion to it like anger

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.809 
and assigned emotion to it like anger
and<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:06.770> they<00:02:06.890> could<00:02:07.039> reminisce<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.579> be<00:02:07.670> like

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
and so they could reminisce and be like

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.850 
and so they could reminisce and be like
odds<00:02:08.110> but<00:02:09.110> get<00:02:09.289> really<00:02:09.500> angry<00:02:09.769> about
