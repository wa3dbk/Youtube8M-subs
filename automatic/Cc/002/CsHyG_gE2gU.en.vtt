scoliosis<00:00:06.590> is<00:00:07.309> a<00:00:07.660> three-dimensional

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
scoliosis is a three-dimensional

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.759 
scoliosis is a three-dimensional
deformity<00:00:09.889> of<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:10.190> spine<00:00:10.570> so<00:00:11.570> when<00:00:12.230> most<00:00:12.590> of

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
deformity of the spine so when most of

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.680 
deformity of the spine so when most of
us<00:00:12.920> think<00:00:13.099> of<00:00:13.250> scoliosis<00:00:13.670> we<00:00:14.120> think<00:00:14.389> of<00:00:14.509> the

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
us think of scoliosis we think of the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.780 
us think of scoliosis we think of the
bend<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.259> spine<00:00:15.530> but<00:00:15.830> it's<00:00:15.980> also<00:00:16.129> a<00:00:16.279> twist

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
bend of the spine but it's also a twist

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.179 
bend of the spine but it's also a twist
of<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.180> spine<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:17.779> that's<00:00:18.470> what<00:00:18.680> we<00:00:18.800> see<00:00:19.009> on

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
of the spine and that's what we see on

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.920 
of the spine and that's what we see on
people's<00:00:19.700> back<00:00:20.000> especially<00:00:20.360> when<00:00:20.630> they<00:00:20.750> lean

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
people's back especially when they lean

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.019 
people's back especially when they lean
forward<00:00:21.349> we<00:00:21.470> see<00:00:21.649> the<00:00:21.860> bump<00:00:22.099> or<00:00:22.610> what<00:00:22.910> is

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
forward we see the bump or what is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.600 
forward we see the bump or what is
termed<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.540> rib<00:00:23.869> hump<00:00:24.110> so<00:00:24.619> it's<00:00:24.829> two<00:00:25.009> parts

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
termed the rib hump so it's two parts

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.729 
termed the rib hump so it's two parts
it's<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:26.300> bend<00:00:26.750> but<00:00:27.230> also<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.800> twist<00:00:28.130> I

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
it's the bend but also the twist I

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.080 
it's the bend but also the twist I
noticed<00:00:30.739> a<00:00:30.860> dance<00:00:31.099> class<00:00:31.399> when<00:00:31.700> she<00:00:31.849> was<00:00:31.939> in

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
noticed a dance class when she was in

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.900 
noticed a dance class when she was in
her<00:00:32.180> leotard<00:00:32.660> that<00:00:33.140> she<00:00:33.500> was<00:00:33.649> standing<00:00:33.920> with

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
her leotard that she was standing with

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.689 
her leotard that she was standing with
one<00:00:35.180> shoulder<00:00:35.450> lower<00:00:35.840> than<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.200> other<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:37.010> so

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
one shoulder lower than the other and so

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.340 
one shoulder lower than the other and so
when<00:00:37.850> I<00:00:37.879> really<00:00:38.300> looked<00:00:38.600> at<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:39.140> saw

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
when I really looked at it and I saw

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.520 
when I really looked at it and I saw
that<00:00:39.500> her<00:00:39.710> old<00:00:40.010> torso<00:00:40.460> was<00:00:40.699> curved<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:42.379> one

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
that her old torso was curved to one

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.279 
that her old torso was curved to one
side<00:00:42.769> so<00:00:43.760> now<00:00:43.879> when<00:00:43.999> we<00:00:44.030> got<00:00:44.210> home<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.809> looked

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
side so now when we got home that looked

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.029 
side so now when we got home that looked
closer<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.570> definitely<00:00:48.170> there<00:00:48.949> was

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
closer and and it definitely there was

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.369 
closer and and it definitely there was
something<00:00:49.429> off<00:00:50.079> somebody<00:00:51.079> went<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.260> the

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
something off somebody went to the

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.470 
something off somebody went to the
pediatrician<00:00:51.909> Allison<00:00:52.909> was<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.269> good

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
pediatrician Allison was a good

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.119 
pediatrician Allison was a good
candidate<00:00:53.870> for<00:00:53.899> surgery<00:00:54.199> because<00:00:54.530> she<00:00:54.920> had<00:00:55.100> a

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
candidate for surgery because she had a

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.579 
candidate for surgery because she had a
large<00:00:55.519> progressive<00:00:56.359> curve<00:00:56.659> and<00:00:57.050> has<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.230> lot<00:00:57.559> of

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
large progressive curve and has a lot of

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.700 
large progressive curve and has a lot of
continued<00:00:58.190> growth<00:00:58.519> so<00:00:58.879> we<00:00:59.030> know<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.710> in

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
continued growth so we know that in

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.410 
continued growth so we know that in
someone<00:01:01.069> who<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.219> progressing<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:02.210> has<00:01:02.390> a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
someone who is progressing that has a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.180 
someone who is progressing that has a
lot<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.839> growth<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.499> curve<00:01:03.710> is<00:01:03.859> already

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
lot of growth and the curve is already

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.040 
lot of growth and the curve is already
large<00:01:04.489> we<00:01:05.180> know<00:01:05.300> that's<00:01:05.449> going<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.750> continue

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
large we know that's going to continue

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.719 
large we know that's going to continue
to<00:01:06.229> get<00:01:06.350> bigger<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.800> bigger<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.130> bigger<00:01:07.220> and

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to get bigger and bigger and bigger and

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.300 
to get bigger and bigger and bigger and
then<00:01:08.180> cause<00:01:08.480> more<00:01:08.870> problems<00:01:09.080> down<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.770> road<00:01:09.800> I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
then cause more problems down the road I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.820 
then cause more problems down the road I
was<00:01:10.700> hoping<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.270> when<00:01:11.720> Amex<00:01:12.170> today<00:01:12.500> said<00:01:12.800> I

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
was hoping that when Amex today said I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.470 
was hoping that when Amex today said I
wouldn't<00:01:13.220> have<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.490> do<00:01:13.790> it<00:01:13.940> from<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.270> back

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
wouldn't have to do it from the back

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.620 
wouldn't have to do it from the back
because<00:01:15.320> it'd<00:01:15.470> be<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.910> longer<00:01:16.910> recovery<00:01:17.210> time

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.200 

basically<00:01:20.650> what<00:01:21.650> we'll<00:01:21.860> do<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.460> you'll<00:01:22.760> you

and in the areas where you have the

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.820 
and in the areas where you have the
curve<00:01:34.880> we<00:01:35.210> go<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:35.660> remove<00:01:35.930> all<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.200> discs

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
curve we go in and remove all the discs

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.550 
curve we go in and remove all the discs
okay<00:01:37.580> okay<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:38.360> then<00:01:38.600> once<00:01:38.780> we<00:01:38.930> get<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.230> discs

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
okay okay and then once we get the discs

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.320 
okay okay and then once we get the discs
out<00:01:39.710> we<00:01:39.950> take<00:01:40.130> little<00:01:40.280> pieces<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.880> your<00:01:41.030> ribs

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
out we take little pieces of your ribs

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.880 
out we take little pieces of your ribs
and<00:01:41.660> we<00:01:41.720> kind<00:01:41.900> of<00:01:41.960> grind<00:01:42.200> those<00:01:42.380> up<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:42.800> then

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
and we kind of grind those up and then

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.470 
and we kind of grind those up and then
we<00:01:43.010> pack<00:01:43.250> those<00:01:43.550> into<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.000> disc<00:01:44.240> spaces

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
we pack those into the disc spaces

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.330 
we pack those into the disc spaces
because<00:01:44.960> that's<00:01:45.290> what<00:01:45.560> allow<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.890> bone<00:01:46.130> to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
because that's what allow the bone to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.640 
because that's what allow the bone to
heal<00:01:46.520> together<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.940> little<00:01:47.120> call<00:01:47.390> fuse<00:01:47.810> okay

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
heal together a little call fuse okay

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.610 
heal together a little call fuse okay
and<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:49.970> put<00:01:50.150> our<00:01:50.240> screws<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.290> then

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
and then we put our screws in and then

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.920 
and then we put our screws in and then
once<00:01:52.070> we<00:01:52.220> get<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.550> screws<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.180> put<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
once we get the screws and we put the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.100 
once we get the screws and we put the
rod<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.830> then<00:01:55.400> we<00:01:55.970> correct<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.540> spine<00:01:56.810> I'm

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
rod in and then we correct a spine I'm

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.200 
rod in and then we correct a spine I'm
gonna<00:01:57.320> call<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:57.830> cantilever<00:01:58.340> motion<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.150> if

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
gonna call a cantilever motion so if

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.570 
gonna call a cantilever motion so if
your<00:01:59.360> spine<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.750> bent<00:01:59.900> like<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.400> put

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
your spine is bent like this and you put

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.090 
your spine is bent like this and you put
the<00:02:01.670> rod

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the rod

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.760 
the rod
now<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.790> press<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.869> take<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:04.560> how

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
now we press down to take it that's how

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.820 
now we press down to take it that's how
I<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> comprise<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.619> correction<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
I get the comprise the correction and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.710 
I get the comprise the correction and
then<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> little<00:02:09.420> tiny

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
then what we do is have a little tiny

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
then what we do is have a little tiny
device<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:10.350> couldn't<00:02:10.739> squeeze<00:02:11.100> all<00:02:11.400> these

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
device we couldn't squeeze all these

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.130 
device we couldn't squeeze all these
levels<00:02:11.850> together<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.780> get<00:02:12.900> further

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
levels together so we get further

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.650 
levels together so we get further
current<00:02:13.560> correction<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.130> compression<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.970> we

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
current correction and compression as we

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.690 
current correction and compression as we
were<00:02:15.810> starting<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.620> develop<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.220> minimally

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
were starting to develop the minimally

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
were starting to develop the minimally
invasive<00:02:18.180> approach<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:19.380> came<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.680> me<00:02:19.770> one<00:02:19.980> day

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
invasive approach it came to me one day

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.120 
invasive approach it came to me one day
is<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.060> know<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.209> was<00:02:21.360> taking<00:02:21.510> discs<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:22.290> why

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
is you know I was taking discs out why

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
is you know I was taking discs out why
can<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.580> put<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.940> instrumentation<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.870> do

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
can I not put the instrumentation and do

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
can I not put the instrumentation and do
the<00:02:25.080> entire<00:02:25.380> correction<00:02:26.130> minimally

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the entire correction minimally

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.250 
the entire correction minimally
invasively<00:02:27.739> traditionally<00:02:28.739> when<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
invasively traditionally when the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.240 
invasively traditionally when the
surgery<00:02:31.260> was<00:02:31.440> done<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.069> large

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
surgery was done with the large

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
surgery was done with the large
thoracotomy<00:02:33.120> obviously<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.690> recovery<00:02:33.989> time

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
thoracotomy obviously the recovery time

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.790 
thoracotomy obviously the recovery time
was<00:02:34.850> dramatically<00:02:36.200> increased<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.620> had

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
was dramatically increased when that had

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.890 
was dramatically increased when that had
to<00:02:37.920> be<00:02:38.010> done<00:02:38.190> whereas<00:02:38.730> with<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.090> surgery<00:02:39.420> the

to be done whereas with this surgery the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.110 
to be done whereas with this surgery the
recovery<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.440> much<00:02:40.620> quicker

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
recovery is much quicker

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.449 
recovery is much quicker
we<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.810> kids<00:02:43.110> back<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.530> school<00:02:43.560> within<00:02:44.100> two

been<00:03:35.400> six<00:03:35.700> months<00:03:35.790> since<00:03:36.030> my<00:03:36.329> surgery<00:03:36.750> and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
been six months since my surgery and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.949 
been six months since my surgery and
I've<00:03:37.560> actually<00:03:37.739> been<00:03:38.130> pretty<00:03:38.340> good<00:03:38.640> um<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.510> mean

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I've actually been pretty good um I mean

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.990 
I've actually been pretty good um I mean
my<00:03:40.140> back<00:03:40.290> gets<00:03:40.470> sore<00:03:40.739> only<00:03:41.100> when<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> do<00:03:41.489> certain

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
my back gets sore only when I do certain

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.930 
my back gets sore only when I do certain
things<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.660> I'm<00:03:43.200> pretty<00:03:43.530> I'm<00:03:43.950> fine<00:03:44.310> doing

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
things but I'm pretty I'm fine doing

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.479 
things but I'm pretty I'm fine doing
stuff<00:03:45.350> then<00:03:46.350> sessions<00:03:46.890> are<00:03:47.040> really<00:03:47.220> small

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
stuff then sessions are really small

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.000 
stuff then sessions are really small
actually<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.450> can<00:03:48.750> really<00:03:49.079> notice<00:03:49.470> them<00:03:49.650> it's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
actually I can really notice them it's

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.210 
actually I can really notice them it's
really<00:03:50.190> hard<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.459> tell<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:52.200> need<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:53.040> get<00:03:53.160> a

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
really hard to tell you need to to get a

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.890 
really hard to tell you need to to get a
good<00:03:53.280> relationship<00:03:53.850> with<00:03:54.150> your<00:03:54.269> surgeon<00:03:54.750> and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
good relationship with your surgeon and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.960 
good relationship with your surgeon and
feel<00:03:55.079> good<00:03:55.290> with<00:03:55.500> them<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.549> need<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.820> know

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
feel good with them and you need to know

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.180 
feel good with them and you need to know
