 and then the deadline comes out 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.340
 I would say then we do this 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.239
 round and a bit more exciting 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.250
 draw 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.379

 the other half to minister sender 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.710
 Part of that I think difficult the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:37.400
 this object is not yet 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:39.780
 The object of lacking jello 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.430

 Berlin sports whatever from 0 to 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.229
 10 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.360
 nor a very specific 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:13.770
 because they have a very specific shape 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:15.169
 you got incredibly bad in 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.430
 this game 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.020
 Maybe I'm just incredibly good 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.180
 yes that may be but my ears are 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.340
 because it's too late for a concert 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.789
 after the domain jean alesi and such a 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.919
 shit on caution very easy 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.590

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.680

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.210

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.710
 spray cream that at least 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.850
 actually no longer allocated the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.800

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:53.870

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:57.720

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.450
 especially for animals 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.170

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.980

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.450

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:22.670

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.670
