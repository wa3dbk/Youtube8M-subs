probably its deadliest aspect because
his<00:01:41.130> acceleration<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> 90s<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
his acceleration is like in the 90s and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.950 
his acceleration is like in the 90s and
the<00:01:43.770> high<00:01:43.920> 90s<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.119> sprint<00:01:45.450> speed<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.810> in

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the high 90s but if sprint speed is in

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200 
the high 90s but if sprint speed is in
the<00:01:46.049> AE<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.740> he<00:01:47.310> does<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.700> away<00:01:47.939> from

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the AE so he does get away from

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.359 
the AE so he does get away from
defenders<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> lot<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:49.920> gets<00:01:50.130> caught

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
defenders a lot but then he gets caught

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.359 
defenders a lot but then he gets caught
up<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> problem<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.500> other<00:01:53.220> than

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
up and that is a problem but other than

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340 
up and that is a problem but other than
that<00:01:53.460> he<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:53.939> an<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.570> round<00:01:54.840> brilliant

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
that he is just an all round brilliant

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
that he is just an all round brilliant
striker<00:01:55.590> he's<00:01:55.860> finesse<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:56.969> at

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
striker he's finesse as you will see at

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
striker he's finesse as you will see at
the<00:01:57.299> end<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.719> crazy<00:01:58.079> ball<00:01:58.860> controls<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.520> point

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the end is crazy ball controls on point

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.899
