your parts technician but it's also

chance that this engine may have been
rebuilt<00:02:50.000> over<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.420> years<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:50.930> someone

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
rebuilt over the years and that someone

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.010 
rebuilt over the years and that someone
may<00:02:51.950> have<00:02:52.070> made<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> change<00:02:52.810> sometimes<00:02:53.810> those

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
may have made a change sometimes those

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.510 
may have made a change sometimes those
changes<00:02:54.260> if<00:02:54.650> they<00:02:54.800> make<00:02:55.010> them<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.220> they<00:02:55.370> don't

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
changes if they make them and they don't

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.850 
changes if they make them and they don't
change<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.940> serial<00:02:56.270> number<00:02:56.570> it'll<00:02:57.440> cause<00:02:57.650> us

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
change the serial number it'll cause us

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.650 
change the serial number it'll cause us
to<00:02:58.040> build<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.490> where<00:02:58.910> we<00:02:59.030> might<00:02:59.270> ship<00:02:59.540> you

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
to build this where we might ship you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.750 
to build this where we might ship you
the<00:02:59.750> wrong<00:02:59.900> part<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:00.620> always<00:03:00.800> good<00:03:01.130> to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
the wrong part so it's always good to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.820 
the wrong part so it's always good to
give<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.150> engine<00:03:02.420> serial<00:03:02.720> number<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.620> find

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
give that engine serial number to find

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.290 
give that engine serial number to find
the<00:03:03.950> description<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.700> engine<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.120> where

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
the description of the engine of where

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.240 
the description of the engine of where
your<00:03:05.480> blower<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.080> your<00:03:06.200> exhaust<00:03:06.560> are<00:03:06.830> mounted

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
your blower and your exhaust are mounted

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.010 
your blower and your exhaust are mounted
maybe<00:03:07.790> even<00:03:08.030> take<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.210> couple<00:03:08.480> pictures<00:03:08.750> to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
maybe even take a couple pictures to

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.540 
maybe even take a couple pictures to
send<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> parts<00:03:09.650> technician<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.430> can

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
send to the parts technician so we can

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.620 
send to the parts technician so we can
give<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.850> correct<00:03:11.060> parts<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.600> first

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
give you the correct parts the first

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.180 
give you the correct parts the first
time<00:03:12.050> we<00:03:12.950> appreciate<00:03:13.370> your<00:03:13.550> time<00:03:13.700> thank<00:03:13.940> you
