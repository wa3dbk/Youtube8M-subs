Arthur Abraham to win this fate and the
reason<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.130> say<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:37.280> Arthur

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
reason I say that is because Arthur

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.700

Carl Froch his territory but when it

Carl Froch his territory but when it

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570

exchanges so I believe it was his first
table<00:06:11.050> sure<00:06:11.230> it<00:06:11.440> just<00:06:11.590> needs<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.830> lot<00:06:11.980> of<00:06:12.010> work

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.610 
table sure it just needs a lot of work
and<00:06:12.580> a<00:06:12.640> belief<00:06:12.970> in<00:06:13.180> himself<00:06:13.390> he<00:06:13.870> can't<00:06:14.260> stand

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
and a belief in himself he can't stand

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.000 
and a belief in himself he can't stand
and<00:06:14.980> exchange<00:06:15.850> maybe<00:06:16.780> not<00:06:17.050> with<00:06:17.560> Arthur

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010
