00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.910 
they're out here just setting some

greenhouse<00:00:27.220> for<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.460> winter<00:00:27.730> trying<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.510> keep

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
greenhouse for the winter trying to keep

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.810 
greenhouse for the winter trying to keep
them<00:00:28.779> as<00:00:28.960> cool<00:00:29.140> as<00:00:29.289> possible<00:00:29.340> without<00:00:30.340> letting

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
them as cool as possible without letting

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.640 
them as cool as possible without letting
any<00:00:30.970> kind<00:00:31.180> of<00:00:31.210> frost<00:00:31.539> touch<00:00:31.779> them<00:00:31.960> so<00:00:32.439> this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
any kind of frost touch them so this

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.619 
any kind of frost touch them so this
environment<00:00:33.190> here<00:00:33.430> now<00:00:33.940> just<00:00:34.300> adds<00:00:34.449> a<00:00:34.540> little

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
environment here now just adds a little

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.840 
environment here now just adds a little
bit<00:00:34.809> more<00:00:34.930> protection<00:00:35.379> and<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:36.550> thought<00:00:36.699> I'd

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
bit more protection and I thought I'd

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.100 
bit more protection and I thought I'd
bring<00:00:36.970> you<00:00:37.150> guys<00:00:37.239> in<00:00:37.420> here<00:00:37.570> because<00:00:37.720> it's<00:00:37.960> not

I'm<00:01:53.319> gonna<00:01:53.470> grab<00:01:53.709> mono<00:01:54.160> my<00:01:54.399> cymbidiums<00:01:55.000> and

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
I'm gonna grab mono my cymbidiums and

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.749 
I'm gonna grab mono my cymbidiums and
just<00:01:56.649> show<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.979> guys<00:01:57.690> what<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.989> cymbidium

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
just show you guys what a cymbidium

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.359 
just show you guys what a cymbidium
bloom<00:02:00.759> spike<00:02:01.119> looks<00:02:01.390> like<00:02:01.599> compared<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.530> what

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
bloom spike looks like compared to what

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.389 
bloom spike looks like compared to what
somebody<00:02:04.060> own<00:02:04.360> growth<00:02:04.929> looks<00:02:05.200> like<00:02:05.399> so

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
somebody own growth looks like so

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.359 
somebody own growth looks like so
hopefully<00:02:06.940> about<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.270> see<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.479> on<00:02:07.569> camera

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
hopefully about to see it on camera

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.780 
hopefully about to see it on camera
inglis<00:02:08.909> in<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.269> properly<00:02:10.370> it's<00:02:11.370> fine<00:02:11.549> a<00:02:11.580> big

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
inglis in here properly it's fine a big

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.100 
inglis in here properly it's fine a big
one<00:02:11.909> to<00:02:12.000> start<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.500> here<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:15.110> this

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
one to start with so this here it this

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.410 
one to start with so this here it this
is<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.319> bloom<00:02:16.590> spike<00:02:16.860> they're<00:02:17.730> sharp<00:02:18.060> they're

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
is a bloom spike they're sharp they're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.880 
is a bloom spike they're sharp they're
smooth<00:02:18.780> they're<00:02:18.810> pointy<00:02:19.500> almost<00:02:19.769> like<00:02:19.860> a

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
smooth they're pointy almost like a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
smooth they're pointy almost like a
spear<00:02:20.310> coming<00:02:20.640> out<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> edge<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> see

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
spear coming out of the edge of the see

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.289 
spear coming out of the edge of the see
the<00:02:21.840> bulb<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.670> particular<00:02:23.879> case

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
the bulb and in this particular case

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.670 
the bulb and in this particular case
they<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.540> more<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.900> red<00:02:25.049> tint<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.440> them<00:02:25.530> as

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
they have more of a red tint to them as

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.710 
they have more of a red tint to them as
well<00:02:25.829> there<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.909> another<00:02:27.150> new<00:02:27.360> one<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.599> my

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
well there is another new one up my

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.509 
well there is another new one up my
fingertip<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.349> hopefully<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:29.099> guys<00:02:29.280> can

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
fingertip there hopefully you guys can

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.430 
fingertip there hopefully you guys can
see<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.599> another<00:02:30.870> new<00:02:31.049> one<00:02:31.200> right<00:02:31.349> there

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
see that and another new one right there

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
see that and another new one right there
and<00:02:34.440> there<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.220> actually<00:02:35.549> another<00:02:35.730> one<00:02:35.909> there

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and there is actually another one there

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.490 
and there is actually another one there
and<00:02:36.299> another<00:02:36.390> one<00:02:36.659> there<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> another<00:02:37.409> one

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
and another one there and another one

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.020 
and another one there and another one
there<00:02:39.079> and<00:02:40.099> another<00:02:41.099> one<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.640> there

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
there and another one in there

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.770 
there and another one in there
but<00:02:42.810> anyway<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:44.160> cymbidium<00:02:44.480> blooms<00:02:45.480> bikes

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
but anyway so the cymbidium blooms bikes

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.009 
but anyway so the cymbidium blooms bikes
are<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.739> smooth<00:02:47.730> quite<00:02:48.720> sharp

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
are going to be smooth quite sharp

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.349 
are going to be smooth quite sharp
looking<00:02:49.410> almost<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.980> spear<00:02:50.400> we'll<00:02:51.239> go

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
looking almost like a spear we'll go

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.670 
looking almost like a spear we'll go
back<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.780> first<00:02:52.019> one<00:02:52.200> here<00:02:52.349> because<00:02:52.470> it's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
back to this first one here because it's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.930 
back to this first one here because it's
the<00:02:52.739> biggest<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.159> will<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.519> easiest<00:02:53.819> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the biggest and will be the easiest to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.780 
the biggest and will be the easiest to
see<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.209> camera<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:55.799> blooms

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
see on camera but that is what blooms

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.030 
see on camera but that is what blooms
bike<00:02:57.060> will<00:02:57.239> look<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.540> now<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.319> new<00:02:58.530> growth<00:02:58.769> is

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
bike will look like now a new growth is

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
bike will look like now a new growth is
going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.310> look<00:02:59.579> just<00:02:59.819> like<00:03:00.299> new<00:03:00.450> growth<00:03:00.690> it's

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
going to look just like new growth it's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.479 
going to look just like new growth it's
going<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.079> be<00:03:01.200> more<00:03:01.379> slender<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:02.220> gonna<00:03:02.340> be

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
going to be more slender it's gonna be

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.539 
going to be more slender it's gonna be
green<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.940> gonna<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.239> them<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.780> natural

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
green it's gonna have them the natural

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.339 
green it's gonna have them the natural
sort<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.640> leaves<00:03:05.819> coming<00:03:06.150> out<00:03:06.209> at<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.359> top<00:03:06.540> so

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
sort of leaves coming out at the top so

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.860 
sort of leaves coming out at the top so
once<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.489> see<00:03:08.519> what<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> new<00:03:09.659> bloom

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
once you can see what the new bloom

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.809 
once you can see what the new bloom
spike<00:03:10.170> will<00:03:10.349> look<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.250> not<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.400> hard

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
spike will look like it's not that hard

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.789 
spike will look like it's not that hard
to<00:03:11.909> UM<00:03:12.329> be<00:03:12.480> able<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.780> distinguish<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.530> a

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
to UM be able to distinguish for a

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.220 
to UM be able to distinguish for a
future<00:03:14.370> reference<00:03:14.880> if<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.750> looks<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.079> new

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
future reference if it looks like a new

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.020 
future reference if it looks like a new
growth<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.739> probably<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.130> new<00:03:17.190> growth<00:03:17.519> if<00:03:17.849> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
growth it's probably a new growth if it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.210 
growth it's probably a new growth if it
looks<00:03:18.209> like<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.389> foreign<00:03:19.380> object<00:03:19.530> poking<00:03:20.099> out

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
looks like a foreign object poking out

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.550 
looks like a foreign object poking out
of<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> cymbidium<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.630> have<00:03:21.780> yourself<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
of the cymbidium you have yourself a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.920 
of the cymbidium you have yourself a
bloom<00:03:22.950> spike<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:24.060> these<00:03:24.180> guys<00:03:24.389> are<00:03:24.450> probably

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
bloom spike so these guys are probably

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.509 
bloom spike so these guys are probably
gonna<00:03:25.200> they're<00:03:25.739> gonna<00:03:25.799> set<00:03:26.099> spikes<00:03:26.370> all

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
gonna they're gonna set spikes all

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.330 
gonna they're gonna set spikes all
winter<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:28.470> will<00:03:28.620> certainly<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:29.160> M

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
winter now this one will certainly be M

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.220 
winter now this one will certainly be M
good<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.090> bring<00:03:30.269> into<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.540> greenhouse<00:03:30.810> now

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
good to bring into the greenhouse now

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.979 
good to bring into the greenhouse now
it's<00:03:31.620> got<00:03:32.090> probably<00:03:33.090> eight<00:03:33.389> or<00:03:33.419> ten<00:03:33.690> spikes

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
it's got probably eight or ten spikes

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.300 
it's got probably eight or ten spikes
coming<00:03:34.290> on<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.829> that's<00:03:35.010> gonna<00:03:35.129> be<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
coming on it so that's gonna be a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.500 
coming on it so that's gonna be a
beautiful<00:03:35.549> display<00:03:37.040> not<00:03:38.040> every<00:03:38.340> year<00:03:38.639> these

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
beautiful display not every year these

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.930 
beautiful display not every year these
Orcas<00:03:39.870> bloom<00:03:40.109> exactly<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.739> same<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.220> find<00:03:41.849> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
Orcas bloom exactly the same I find it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.580 
Orcas bloom exactly the same I find it

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
with each cymbidium and they alternate

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.640 
with each cymbidium and they alternate
last<00:03:51.389> year<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.660> had<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.079> had<00:03:52.139> eight<00:03:52.410> bloom

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
last year I had one that had eight bloom

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.589 
last year I had one that had eight bloom
spikes<00:03:52.949> on<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.220> once<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.970> year<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.329> far<00:03:54.540> I

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
spikes on it once this year so far I

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.020 
spikes on it once this year so far I
only<00:03:54.870> see<00:03:55.109> two<00:03:55.139> or<00:03:55.379> three<00:03:55.650> blooms<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.579> it<00:03:56.760> for

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
only see two or three blooms on it for

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.460 
only see two or three blooms on it for
whatever<00:03:57.180> reason<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:58.049> know<00:03:58.169> it<00:03:58.230> bloomed

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
whatever reason you know it bloomed

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.949 
whatever reason you know it bloomed
really<00:03:58.739> well<00:03:58.859> it<00:03:59.190> bloomed<00:03:59.489> until<00:03:59.879> late<00:04:00.629> May

really well it bloomed until late May
last<00:04:01.199> year<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.709> has<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> late<00:04:02.099> start<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.760> its

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
last year so it has a late start to its

last year so it has a late start to its
growth<00:04:03.239> season<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:04.260> grew<00:04:04.500> some<00:04:04.739> pseudo<00:04:05.040> bulbs

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
growth season it grew some pseudo bulbs

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.280
