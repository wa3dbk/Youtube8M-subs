00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the dry amp that way these these amps

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980 
the dry amp that way these these amps
operate<00:01:16.560> independently<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> each<00:01:17.640> other<00:01:17.990> the

dry amp doesn't get interfered with with

the echo and the coursing and all that
that's<00:01:24.659> all

that's all
amplified<00:01:26.189> separately<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
amplified separately that's what the

amplified separately that's what the
center<00:01:28.320> stack<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.759> effects<00:01:31.700> so

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
center stack is all just effects so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.179 
center stack is all just effects so
you've<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.570> four<00:01:33.990> outer<00:01:34.350> cabs<00:01:34.829> are

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you've got the four outer cabs are

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.999 
you've got the four outer cabs are
running<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> dry<00:01:36.390> dry<00:01:36.869> signal<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.829> is

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099

to<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.659> but<00:03:47.659> it's<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.170> reverb<00:03:56.950> that's

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
to it but it's just a reverb that's

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.490 
to it but it's just a reverb that's
pretty<00:03:58.219> much<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.609> really<00:03:58.819> there's<00:03:59.439> not<00:04:00.439> a
