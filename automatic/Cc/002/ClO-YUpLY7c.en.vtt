00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.670
 hello to all of you pros even though the chain 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.150
 you present yourself in what is called six commandos 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.289
 the site simply 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.649
 seeing that he has infiltrated more 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.729
 not that I deserve my taste 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.689
 we toast 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.689
 what is this material worth? 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:25.369
 tusk 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.609
 jean-marc to the fallen dead 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.919
 that's just how we learn 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.080
 I used 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.080
 September 25 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.660
 ap 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.260
 % 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.240
 quite some time 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.600
 we arrive at aramon average results we can not wait to make money 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.980
 alassane ouattara 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.790
 it came out electric current I see to finish in the bush approaching 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.060
 see so 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
 for a little more tour a little bigger than what 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.320
 people we estimate repeatedly proposed that it suits him 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.649
 the best money to buy after 3-2 sometimes there is more than a month of 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.990
 seat is done 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.440
 we confirm here 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 currently that's why 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.560
 tusk 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.310
 for those who arrive 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.130
 s 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.939
 I think we can not be a little bit my little son 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.939
 it's a race 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.060
 pascal layerpin 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.899
 1 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.899
 but in any case send little by little not too bad in udder 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.080
 much more to patrol the streets 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.440
 Cecile Prior 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.840
 here we approve patrol define but we have 90 cm 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.570
 a third account 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.570
 actually scared Montreal 99% 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.840
 after nothing else broke the couple 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.919
 after 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.279
 my heart 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.969
 power m 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.090
 fuel 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.889
 level 3 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.719
 close to the cut of the tree 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.409
 4 it'll take one to four 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.190
 m all this messi story 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.139
 Well Named 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.139
 ap the voyeurs it's with rings 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.499
 the first came to us is not it to hang the 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.499
 belt is not bad to do a little 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.429
 but is not it simply 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.169
 but after that it's true that at the fingertips 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.849
 in order to attract 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.729
 even if you have an existing one small swiss luisao 30 ciccone 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.469
 it's better 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.709
 privilege comfort 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.569
 so why want to prepare the true sequel 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.069
 why we are here 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.339
 adding a little time 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.669
 so that's what I think most of all we said 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.749
 continued on the circuit this season 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.289
 since I will soon submit
