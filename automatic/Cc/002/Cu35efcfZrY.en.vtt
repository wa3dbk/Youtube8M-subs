won't we need a window of course but on

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.550 
won't we need a window of course but on
submarines<00:02:33.980> they're<00:02:34.430> called<00:02:34.730> portholes<00:02:35.560> by

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
submarines they're called portholes by

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.360 
submarines they're called portholes by
jewel<00:02:36.920> two<00:02:37.280> circles<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.569> large<00:02:39.440> one<00:02:39.860> with<00:02:40.340> a

little one inside I tell my turn Oh Joel
the<00:02:43.579> second<00:02:43.940> porthole<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.480> now<00:02:50.930> I'm<00:02:51.170> going<00:02:51.380> to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
the second porthole and now I'm going to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.780 
the second porthole and now I'm going to
draw<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.799> hole<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:54.319> hole<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.459> we<00:02:55.579> can

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
draw the hole the hole so that we can

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.030 
draw the hole the hole so that we can
navigate<00:02:56.000> when<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> submarines<00:02:57.470> above<00:02:57.799> water

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
navigate when the submarines above water

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.500 
navigate when the submarines above water
you<00:02:58.760> draw<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> hunt<00:02:59.329> shape<00:02:59.630> on<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.930> body

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
you draw a hunt shape on the body

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.629 
you draw a hunt shape on the body
voila<00:03:02.750> next<00:03:03.650> we<00:03:03.829> just<00:03:03.859> have<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.400> draw<00:03:04.579> the

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
voila next we just have to draw the

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.000 
voila next we just have to draw the
rudder

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
rudder

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.340 
rudder
it's<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.310> rudder<00:03:07.519> that<00:03:08.239> allows<00:03:08.630> us<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.930> see

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
it's the rudder that allows us to see

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.449 
it's the rudder that allows us to see
the<00:03:09.590> submarine<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.459> draw<00:03:11.359> a<00:03:11.600> rectangle<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.160> now

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
the submarine I draw a rectangle and now

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.910 
the submarine I draw a rectangle and now
we<00:03:13.519> draw<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.000> propeller<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.959> draw<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.440> small

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
we draw the propeller I draw a small

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.910 
we draw the propeller I draw a small
circle<00:03:15.950> behind<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.090> body<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.660> two<00:03:18.109> ovals<00:03:18.650> one

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
circle behind the body and two ovals one

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:34.509 
circle behind the body and two ovals one
each<00:03:19.100> side<00:03:31.150> that's<00:03:32.150> because<00:03:32.840> I'm<00:03:33.019> clever<00:03:33.519> and

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
each side that's because I'm clever and

00:03:34.519 --> 00:04:47.000 
each side that's because I'm clever and
now<00:03:34.790> we<00:03:34.849> just<00:03:35.209> have<00:03:35.420> to

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
so my joy you your own submarine then

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.780 
so my joy you your own submarine then
you<00:04:50.380> can<00:04:50.560> go<00:04:50.710> wherever<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:51.310> like

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
I do clearly really so draw a submarine

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.640 
I do clearly really so draw a submarine
you<00:05:00.400> start<00:05:00.760> by<00:05:00.970> drawing<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.390> body<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:02.020> very

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
you start by drawing the body a very

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.210 
you start by drawing the body a very
long<00:05:02.979> oval<00:05:03.550> shape<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.530> if<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.680> want<00:05:05.919> to<00:05:06.040> see

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
long oval shape and if you want to see

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.580 
long oval shape and if you want to see
the<00:05:06.370> beautiful<00:05:06.790> fishies<00:05:07.450> these<00:05:08.080> were<00:05:08.260> two

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
the beautiful fishies these were two

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.000 
the beautiful fishies these were two
portholes<00:05:09.370> nice<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.510> round<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:11.710> draw<00:05:11.950> the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
portholes nice and round to draw the

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.850 
portholes nice and round to draw the
hull<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:13.060> draw<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.479> hunter<00:05:13.930> shape<00:05:14.169> on<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.680> body

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
hull you draw a hunter shape on the body

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.060 
hull you draw a hunter shape on the body
and<00:05:15.250> then<00:05:15.700> you<00:05:16.210> draw<00:05:16.450> a<00:05:16.479> rectangle<00:05:17.440> for<00:05:17.890> the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
and then you draw a rectangle for the

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.400 
and then you draw a rectangle for the
rudder<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.820> now<00:05:19.210> all<00:05:19.540> that's<00:05:19.720> left<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.140> draw

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
rudder and now all that's left to draw

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.830 
rudder and now all that's left to draw
is<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.710> propeller<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.669> draw<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.270> circle<00:05:22.750> on

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
is the propeller you draw a circle on

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.260 
is the propeller you draw a circle on
the<00:05:23.020> body<00:05:23.229> and<00:05:23.530> two<00:05:23.800> ovals<00:05:24.370> either<00:05:24.610> side<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:24.970> it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
the body and two ovals either side of it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.170 
the body and two ovals either side of it
and<00:05:25.540> then<00:05:26.290> you<00:05:26.530> can<00:05:26.740> color<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:27.430> however<00:05:27.760> you

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
and then you can color it in however you

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.540 
and then you can color it in however you
like
