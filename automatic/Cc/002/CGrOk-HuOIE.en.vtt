00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
this is my world we're at the very end

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.380 
this is my world we're at the very end
of<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.540> whole<00:01:41.720> process<00:01:41.960> right<00:01:42.710> now<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:44.210> is

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
of the whole process right now this is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.390 
of the whole process right now this is
the<00:01:44.510> final<00:01:44.900> product<00:01:45.140> but<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.590> mean<00:01:45.830> along<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
the final product but I mean along the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.520 
the final product but I mean along the
way<00:01:46.520> there's<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.480> many<00:01:47.630> different<00:01:48.110> pieces<00:01:48.320> of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
way there's so many different pieces of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.830 
way there's so many different pieces of
the<00:01:48.710> puzzle<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:49.700> once<00:01:50.030> one<00:01:50.330> goes<00:01:50.570> down

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
the puzzle you once one goes down

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.260 
the puzzle you once one goes down
it<00:01:51.140> affects<00:01:51.560> before<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.100> after<00:01:52.460> yeah<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:52.880> it's

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
it affects before and after yeah so it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.660 
it affects before and after yeah so it's
like<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.420> big<00:01:53.660> train

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 

well<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.600> rains<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.050> means<00:02:04.290> business

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
well when it rains that means business

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.430 
well when it rains that means business
is<00:02:04.860> good<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.340> us<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.840> sewers<00:02:07.229> we

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
is good for us because the sewers we

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.980 
is good for us because the sewers we
have<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> combined<00:02:07.979> sewer<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.670> storm<00:02:09.360> water<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
have a combined sewer so storm water and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.080 
have a combined sewer so storm water and
wastewater<00:02:10.590> all<00:02:11.100> conveyed<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> plant<00:02:12.000> in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
wastewater all conveyed to the plant in

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.350 
wastewater all conveyed to the plant in
the<00:02:12.150> same<00:02:12.420> conduit<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.860> when<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> rains<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:15.240> get

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the same conduit so when it rains we get

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.930 
the same conduit so when it rains we get
a<00:02:15.390> huge<00:02:15.630> influx<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.319> get<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> major<00:02:16.940> flushing

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
a huge influx you get a major flushing

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:28.640 
a huge influx you get a major flushing
of<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> toilet<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> might<00:02:19.020> call<00:02:19.290> it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680 

well<00:02:29.099> this<00:02:29.250> plant<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.879> treat<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.299> one<00:02:30.480> minute

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
well this plant can treat in one minute

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.229 
well this plant can treat in one minute
with<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> average<00:02:31.830> size<00:02:32.040> plant<00:02:32.400> treats<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
with the average size plant treats in a

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:41.559 
with the average size plant treats in a
day

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.830 

there<00:02:42.110> are<00:02:42.319> eight<00:02:42.590> tanks<00:02:43.400> there<00:02:44.239> about<00:02:44.390> 17

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
there are eight tanks there about 17

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
out in the drying cells to dry they're

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.170 
out in the drying cells to dry they're
talking<00:03:32.830> about<00:03:33.040> six<00:03:33.310> weeks<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.880> weather's

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
has this graph on it so that it's easy

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.290 
has this graph on it so that it's easy

hours<00:06:13.860> what<00:06:14.400> was<00:06:14.430> one<00:06:15.000> bacteria<00:06:15.600> on<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:15.780> filter

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
hours what was one bacteria on a filter

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.830 
hours what was one bacteria on a filter
becomes<00:06:16.410> about<00:06:16.650> 8<00:06:16.830> million<00:06:17.070> bacteria<00:06:17.840> 8

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
becomes about 8 million bacteria 8

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720 
becomes about 8 million bacteria 8
million<00:06:19.290> is<00:06:19.410> a<00:06:19.440> big<00:06:19.620> city<00:06:19.920> as<00:06:20.130> opposed<00:06:20.460> to<00:06:20.610> one

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
million is a big city as opposed to one

so<00:06:22.080> after<00:06:22.950> 24<00:06:23.820> hours<00:06:23.850> these<00:06:24.390> bigger<00:06:24.720> blue

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
so after 24 hours these bigger blue

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.060 
so after 24 hours these bigger blue
bumps<00:06:25.350> are<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:25.620> ones<00:06:25.770> we're<00:06:25.920> counting<00:06:27.890> so<00:06:28.890> now

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
bumps are the ones we're counting so now

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.100 
bumps are the ones we're counting so now
that's<00:06:29.430> that<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.120> bugs<00:06:30.300> have<00:06:30.480> eaten<00:06:30.720> solids

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
that's that the bugs have eaten solids

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.330 
that's that the bugs have eaten solids
and<00:06:31.170> they<00:06:31.260> get<00:06:31.410> heavy<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:31.950> they<00:06:32.040> want<00:06:32.250> to
