00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.859
 but in this way with that struggle for the 

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:18.780
 Johan Cruyff scale and with the 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.029

 Jupiler League comes out just like young Ajax 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.950
 Willem 2 that relegated on the day that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.579
 ajax became champion last year and how 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.349

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.889

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:12.430
 just now 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.590
 and Vermeer sees his formidable competitor 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.920

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.700
 John turn beautifully with the left hand 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.650
 they will prevent the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.730
 marvin also sees the match goal 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.090

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.250
 davy also got a shot 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.250
 turned by david meul 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.260
 attempt by Klaassen then Willem 2 again 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.360
 with the long ball from reverse direction 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.400
 ruud boymans boymans 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.900
 marcelissen again prevents the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.610
 connection goal 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.220
 for him too this is a good thing because 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.410
 this duel is organized to all 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.959
 players who barely entered yesterday 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.920
 action nevertheless left 90 minutes 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.739
 play football 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.250
 davy klaassen flick the ball just beside it 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.830
 target 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.959
 walk him over david meul 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.120
 next to the goal 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.540
 so not even 3 0 willem 2 then again 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.610
 misidjan 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.470
 quickly in duel with the sa but also quickly 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.799
 yet the violation of the hall and the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:23.140
 free kick is for the tilburgers it is 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.750
 zanelli taking the free kick and there 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.549
 choose 214 castle is to do nothing 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.890
 dries wuytens 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.280
 defending from psv heads the ball behind 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.280
 goalkeeper 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.860
 from the hear this is a duo forms this 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.360
 duel with stefano denswil 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.819
 davy klaassen pulls him for sanae 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.700
 and serero nicely viewed in the far corner 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.260
 placed and it is 3 a south african 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.420
 make sure 6 minutes after the match goal 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.770
 from willem 2 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:05.150
 who for a margin of two goals 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:08.130
 for ajax in final phase and competition then 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.870
 she back on sana 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.890
 which is therefore good for a goal and 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.890
 I was this duel 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.609
 along with the sliders just before it 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.280
 goal along it's the last attempt 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.820
 ground is a training game for the sake of it 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.880
 so to speak 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.919
 Ajax wins Willem 2 with three one 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.419
 and so they also have these eleven players 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.419
 90 minutes in the legs
