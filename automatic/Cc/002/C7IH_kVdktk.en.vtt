00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.490 

anyway<00:03:20.420> that's<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.050> update<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.680> June<00:03:21.890> eighth

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
anyway that's the update for June eighth

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.430 
anyway that's the update for June eighth
as<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.709> can<00:03:24.890> see<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:27.069> lateral<00:03:28.069> branches<00:03:28.220> are

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
as you can see the lateral branches are

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.940 
as you can see the lateral branches are
coming<00:03:30.440> out<00:03:30.560> like<00:03:30.739> crazy<00:03:32.410> they've<00:03:33.410> all<00:03:33.590> three

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
coming out like crazy they've all three

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.120 
coming out like crazy they've all three
exceeded<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.670> roofline<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.980> iron<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
exceeded the roofline and iron the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:51.009 
exceeded the roofline and iron the
process<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.760> bushing<00:03:38.090> out<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:50.540> there<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.989> go

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
process of bushing out so there you go

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.320 
process of bushing out so there you go
probably<00:03:51.470> next<00:03:51.890> update<00:03:52.280> will<00:03:52.310> be<00:03:52.519> with<00:03:52.940> some

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
probably next update will be with some

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.620 
probably next update will be with some
spiny<00:03:54.019> hoppers
