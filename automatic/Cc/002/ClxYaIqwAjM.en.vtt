this kid has brought a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.140 
this kid has brought a
a<00:02:07.490> sense<00:02:08.450> of<00:02:08.690> excitement<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:10.400> a<00:02:10.430> franchise

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
a sense of excitement to a franchise

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.700 
a sense of excitement to a franchise
which<00:02:11.360> really<00:02:11.720> we've<00:02:12.050> talked<00:02:12.320> about<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
which really we've talked about on the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.210 
which really we've talked about on the
show<00:02:12.800> before<00:02:13.070> is<00:02:13.990> dormant<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.650> owner<00:02:15.860> doesn't

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220
