this usually I get on a like second or
third<00:02:09.110> try<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.060> also<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.510> not<00:02:11.569> like<00:02:11.780> a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840

something you'd also go for like the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.100 
something you'd also go for like the
wall<00:03:47.190> bang<00:03:47.430> tag<00:03:47.880> wallbang<00:03:48.480> leaving<00:03:48.960> it<00:03:49.050> up

looking down and out you can make a left
right<00:04:00.270> there<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.870> that's<00:04:01.140> pretty<00:04:01.380> much<00:04:01.440> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
right there and that's pretty much the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.050 
right there and that's pretty much the
furthest<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.130> go<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.490> you<00:04:02.790> can't<00:04:02.970> go
