NO CM -- AD NAUSEAM.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.980
WHAT MAKES THIS DISCUSSION

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.210
NEVER-ENDING?

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.050
THE FAN BASE THAT HAS BEEN

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.410
ROCKING ORACLE FOR 124 STRAIGHT

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.320
SELLOUTS.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.990
AND WHEN GUY KNOWS A LOT ABOUT

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.930
THIS ARENA IS ABC SAN FRANCISCO

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990
SPORTS ANCHOR MIKE SHUMAN, WHO

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.490
HAS BEEN WATCHING WARRIORS GAMES

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.300
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.930
HE SAYS THEY ARE SMART.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.110
MIKE: HE

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.610
SAYS -- THE FANS

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.270
UNDERSTAND AGAIN.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.240
THEY KNOW WHEN TO BE QUIET.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.350
IT IS THIS RUSSELL GROUP.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.010
THEY HAVE BEEN -- THIS IS A

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.380
SPECIAL GROUP.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.680
THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.410
LONG.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.380
I THINK THIS YEAR MORE THAN ANY

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.080
IN THE PAST THEY FEEL LIKE THE

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.370
TEAM HAS A PASS -- A CHANCE.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.420
SHARIEF:

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.060
ASK THE PELICANS IN THE

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.990
FIRST GAME OF THIS SERIES.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.130
HENCE WHY GOLDEN STATE IS AN

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.990
--

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.330
WRITING A 19 GAME WINNING

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.160
STREAK.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.530
THEY GET THAT PLACE JUMPING.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.140
I DIDN'T ALMOST EVERY ARENA

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.570
IN THE LEAGUE.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.970
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.640
THIS PLACE.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.140
MAYBE IT'S RIGHT OF THE

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.510
STRUCTURE -- PART OF THE

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.120
STRUCTURE.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.210
THE SOUND REVERBERATES.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.180
SHARIEF: THOSE FANS HAD ORACLE

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.680
SHAKING WHEN CLAY THOMAS SCORED

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.630
AGAINST THE KINGS.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.060
THAT IS 37 POINTS IN JUST THE

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.260
THIRD QUARTER.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.630
COMCAST SPORTS BAY AREA SAW

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.610
FIRST HAND WHICH SHOWED HER HOW

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.260
PASSIONATE FANS ARE AND HOW MUCH

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.440
THE PLAYERS FEET OFF OF IT.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.040
THE CROWD GETS LOUD.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.540
AND THEN HE GETS LETTER.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.570
THEN YOU FEEL IT.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.410
IT GETS EVEN BETTER.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.850
THEN HE MISSED US -- AND HE

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.710
MISSED A SHOT.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.380
IT IS BECAUSE OF THE CROWD.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.650
THEY HAVE SAID, THIS IS THE BEST

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.650
FANS IN THE ENTIRE NBA.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.360
THE BEST ARENA TO PLAY.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.100
OBVIOUSLY TEAMS HAVE SEEN THAT

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.390
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONLY LOST TWO

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.690
GAMES.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.420
SHARIEF: JULY THE TEAM THAT BEAT

LEFT ONE CAME AGAINST THE BULLS
