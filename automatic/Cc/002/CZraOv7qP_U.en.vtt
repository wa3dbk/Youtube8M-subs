are<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.559> different<00:01:04.650> ways<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.460> cut

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
are two different ways that you can cut

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
are two different ways that you can cut
it<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.619> pin<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it this out you can pin right to the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.600 
it this out you can pin right to the
felt<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> paper<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.460> you're

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
felt through the paper just like you're

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
felt through the paper just like you're
doing<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.920> clothing<00:01:13.920> pattern<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.360> cut<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
doing a clothing pattern and just cut it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:29.060 
doing a clothing pattern and just cut it
out

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.620 

or<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.789> can<00:01:31.060> take<00:01:31.539> an<00:01:31.689> exacto<00:01:32.170> knife<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:33.630> cut

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
or you can take an exacto knife and cut

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.850 
or you can take an exacto knife and cut
the<00:01:34.899> shape<00:01:35.409> out

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.760 

and<00:01:42.300> then<00:01:43.300> just<00:01:43.660> use<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:46.560> pattern<00:01:47.560> that's

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
and then just use the pattern that's

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.290 
and then just use the pattern that's
left<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.970> paper<00:01:49.210> as<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:50.470> stencil<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.460> use<00:01:52.270> a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
left in the paper as a stencil and use a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.450 
left in the paper as a stencil and use a
Sharpie<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:53.020> draw<00:01:53.350> on<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.560> felt<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:53.920> then<00:01:54.190> cut

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
Sharpie to draw on the felt and then cut

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.990 
Sharpie to draw on the felt and then cut
it<00:01:54.490> out

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
it out

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.460 
it out
I<00:01:55.030> find<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:57.010> first<00:01:57.270> way<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.540> a<00:01:58.810> whole<00:01:59.230> lot

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
I find that the first way is a whole lot

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.950 
I find that the first way is a whole lot
easier<00:01:59.710> but<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.060> up<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.840> your

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
easier but it is up to you and your

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.370 
easier but it is up to you and your
preference<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.830> how<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.250> want<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:04.140> copy<00:02:05.140> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
preference and how you want to copy the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.780 
preference and how you want to copy the
pattern<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.920> cut<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.280> out<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:09.399> go<00:02:09.580> ahead

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
pattern and cut it out and I go ahead

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.910 
pattern and cut it out and I go ahead
and<00:02:09.940> do<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:11.200> for<00:02:11.650> all<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.070> pieces<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.920> I'm

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and do that for all the pieces and I'm

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.950 
and do that for all the pieces and I'm
just<00:02:15.400> showing<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.820> all<00:02:16.120> them<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.780> have

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
just showing you all them that I have

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:29.650 
just showing you all them that I have
cut<00:02:17.170> up

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.860 

next<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.840> lay<00:02:31.290> them<00:02:31.530> onto<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.430> scarf<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.690> the

next just lay them onto the scarf on the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.180 
next just lay them onto the scarf on the
bottom<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:36.030> right<00:02:36.900> side<00:02:37.290> all<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.890> fleece
