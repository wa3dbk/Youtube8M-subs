so what we're going to do in each case

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.529 
so what we're going to do in each case
is<00:00:41.969> look<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.620> UK<00:00:43.620> site<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> subject

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
is look at the UK site and do a subject

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.840 
is look at the UK site and do a subject
search<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:46.890> compare<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> result

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
under license than it ought to work at

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.700 
under license than it ought to work at
least<00:06:48.310> as<00:06:48.520> well<00:06:48.550> as<00:06:48.760> you<00:06:49.389> Cass<00:06:49.659> but<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.590> fact

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
least as well as you Cass but the fact

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.770 
least as well as you Cass but the fact
of<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:50.919> matter<00:06:50.979> is<00:06:51.220> that<00:06:51.340> it<00:06:51.639> doesn't<00:06:51.970> and<00:06:52.150> the

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
of the matter is that it doesn't and the

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.089 
of the matter is that it doesn't and the
reason<00:06:53.050> that<00:06:53.110> it<00:06:53.260> doesn't<00:06:53.560> of<00:06:53.650> course<00:06:53.680> is

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.099 
reason that it doesn't of course is

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.129 
reason that it doesn't of course is
because<00:06:54.550> it<00:06:54.669> uses<00:06:54.880> the<00:06:55.210> wrong<00:06:55.510> technology

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
because it uses the wrong technology

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.370 
because it uses the wrong technology
it's<00:06:56.680> using<00:06:57.099> a<00:06:57.250> search<00:06:57.880> engine<00:06:58.030> technology<00:06:58.720> so

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
it's using a search engine technology so

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.499 
it's using a search engine technology so
when<00:06:59.530> I<00:06:59.560> look<00:06:59.830> at<00:06:59.979> court<00:07:00.159> for<00:07:00.280> a<00:07:00.340> course<00:07:00.580> for<00:07:01.270> IT

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:01.509 
when I look at court for a course for IT

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.379 
when I look at court for a course for IT
management<00:07:02.110> it<00:07:02.770> finds<00:07:03.130> the<00:07:03.159> word<00:07:03.370> it<00:07:03.610> and<00:07:03.970> it

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
management it finds the word it and it

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.270 
management it finds the word it and it
finds<00:07:04.599> the<00:07:04.720> word<00:07:04.930> management<00:07:05.470> and<00:07:05.680> it<00:07:06.070> comes

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
finds the word management and it comes

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.550 
finds the word management and it comes
up<00:07:06.520> with<00:07:06.729> a<00:07:06.940> zillion<00:07:07.509> courses<00:07:08.080> which<00:07:08.289> have<00:07:08.409> got
