00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone with you impudent let's 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.790
 Today we will look at the review on the figure Aron 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.400
 marvel legends patriot 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.320
 iron patriot translation unfortunately 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 box I've managed to throw on 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 patient new figure looks 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 excellent without a box I do not regret my 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.930
 money spent on this figure because 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 that she is just super 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.570
 he has great detail 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.090
 coloring and she's just adorable but 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.789
 Now let's look at the figure here we are 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.120
 see a great coloring I can't even 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.399
 nothing nobody else to complain about 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.129
 everywhere everything is perfectly done and done 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.890
 painted not just one mark 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.260
 let's look back in the back of it all 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.510
 also performed at the highest level such 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 here he has cool glue let's 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.590
 look mobility 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.930
 so here they turn their legs 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.430
 all the knees are very hard 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 turn bend oh so well and feet 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.340
 feet 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.890
 they don't move out of this one thing 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.250
 just up a little bit down and on the sides 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.110
 give all the leg itself so that's fine 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.689
 nothing prevents and she can easily 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.520
 rotate and you can make an epic 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.780
 pose 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 little by little here are turning us 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.210
 torso 360 degrees and twirl not 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.330
 I will because it is quite dangerous 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.619
 much back here bends back 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.400
 cool the first time I see such a figure 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.790
 with that flexibility let's go now 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 move on to his hands 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.930
 so bend at us in elbows so here 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.119
 here the same is just a little vata 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:50.490
 bend we see that he is having one 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.720
 palm open and as if he let 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.820
 the laser and the other palm are clenched in a fist 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.649
 let's see his head is great 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.299
 texture so here it is a little bit 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.509
 turns on of course on the sides 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:10.140
 so down up up they are strong 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.190
 rises not that my friend's 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 human life 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.370
 This is how he gets the stove pose 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.040
 to botan fly 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.180
 wait here I found on his head 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.630
 a little mark 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.850
 Here is the paint here is bad printed but 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.980
 it's not that bad let me now 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.610
 show you his device is his course 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.520
 machine gun it is removed and also 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.820
 is attached back here you can in this 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.730
 side and the other also you attach it 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.280
 he can also move and shoot 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.280
 in different directions and turns and 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:50.040
 up and down now here's show you so 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.840
 Here in different directions may shoot in 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.190
 Generally a great device iq here we have it 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.800
 put back to the place where he is 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.660
 was standing 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.290
 teksturka in this conventional machine gun 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 black 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.960
 such a hard plastic well, I think the creators 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.900
 you could decorate it a little bit 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.640
 as if i don't know to add red light 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.130
 but it still does not spoil our figure 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.220
 let's add our figures now 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.050
 such a pretty typical look and immediately 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:23.459
 put it on the shelf so head up 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:26.370
 a machine gun like that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.590
 I like it and so if you like it 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.480

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.520
