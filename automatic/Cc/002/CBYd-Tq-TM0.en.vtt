let's get started

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
let's get started
here's<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.920> helmet<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.520> I'm<00:00:44.610> gonna<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.940> using

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
here's the helmet but I'm gonna be using

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.000 
here's the helmet but I'm gonna be using
is<00:00:45.649> this<00:00:46.649> mount<00:00:46.980> system<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> GoPro<00:00:48.600> cage

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
is this mount system with the GoPro cage

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
is this mount system with the GoPro cage
would<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.250> an<00:00:50.850> extra<00:00:51.239> knob<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
would be an extra knob up here so you

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
would be an extra knob up here so you
can<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.350> extra<00:00:53.149> rotation<00:00:54.149> when<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
front of the helmet and I'm going to be

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.229 
front of the helmet and I'm going to be
using<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.989> curved<00:00:58.379> mount<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.489> fit<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
using a curved mount so it can fit on it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.179 
using a curved mount so it can fit on it
a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:02.030> better
