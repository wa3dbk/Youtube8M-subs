00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
in this video I'm going to talk about

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.359 
in this video I'm going to talk about
getting<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.540> shallow<00:00:18.930> depth<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.410> field<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
getting a shallow depth of field in the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.470 
getting a shallow depth of field in the
studio<00:00:20.760> environment

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
studio environment

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.330 
studio environment
now<00:00:21.990> shallow<00:00:22.260> depth<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.590> field<00:00:22.650> makes<00:00:23.160> your

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
now shallow depth of field makes your

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.490 
now shallow depth of field makes your
portraits<00:00:23.849> look<00:00:24.029> fantastic<00:00:24.300> give<00:00:25.230> them<00:00:25.380> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
portraits look fantastic give them that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.450 
portraits look fantastic give them that
kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.770> dreamy<00:00:26.490> sort<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.910> ethereal<00:00:27.599> look<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
kind of dreamy sort of ethereal look and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.609 
kind of dreamy sort of ethereal look and
outside<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.970> fairly<00:00:30.390> easy<00:00:30.540> to<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.020> but<00:00:31.500> in

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
outside it's fairly easy to do but in

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.260 
outside it's fairly easy to do but in
studio<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.250> always<00:00:32.489> been<00:00:32.669> quite<00:00:32.970> tricky

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
studio it's always been quite tricky

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.690 
studio it's always been quite tricky
that's<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.200> because<00:00:34.470> studio<00:00:34.950> flash<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that's really because studio flash that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400 
that's really because studio flash that
we<00:00:35.790> tend<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.750> actually<00:00:37.230> really

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
we tend to use is actually really

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.470 
we tend to use is actually really
powerful<00:00:37.739> punches<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.640> lot<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.060> light<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
powerful punches out a lot of light and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.680 
powerful punches out a lot of light and
ends<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.380> a<00:00:40.710> small<00:00:41.340> aperture<00:00:41.609> and<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.539> big

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
ends up with a small aperture and a big

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.259 
ends up with a small aperture and a big
depth<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.079> field<00:00:43.289> so<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.640> need<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> big

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
depth of field so what we need is a big

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.299 
depth of field so what we need is a big
aperture<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.230> very<00:00:46.410> small<00:00:46.710> depth<00:00:46.949> of<00:00:47.129> field

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
aperture and a very small depth of field

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
aperture and a very small depth of field
and<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.269> need<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.449> little<00:00:48.600> bit<00:00:48.780> less

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and to do that we need a little bit less

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.799 
and to do that we need a little bit less
light<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:50.190> fact<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.519> we<00:00:50.609> need<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
light in fact what we need is one of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.860 
light in fact what we need is one of
these<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> light<00:00:53.879> bank<00:00:54.179> from<00:00:54.600> Mick

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
these this is the light bank from Mick

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.650 
these this is the light bank from Mick
and<00:00:55.050> Sue<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.129> continuous<00:00:56.730> light<00:00:57.149> rather

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and Sue it's a continuous light rather

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.990 
and Sue it's a continuous light rather
than<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> flash<00:00:58.410> light<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.670> ideal<00:00:59.969> for

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
than a flash light and is ideal for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700 
than a flash light and is ideal for
video<00:01:00.449> work<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.289> normally<00:01:01.379> use

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
video work which is what I normally use

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.970 
video work which is what I normally use
it<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.030> portrait<00:01:03.870> photography<00:01:04.620> still

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
it for but in portrait photography still

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.580 
it for but in portrait photography still
photography<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.970> produces<00:01:06.570> plenty<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.409> light

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
photography it produces plenty of light

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
photography it produces plenty of light
more<00:01:08.340> than<00:01:08.370> enough<00:01:08.730> to<00:01:08.909> illuminate<00:01:09.330> our

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
more than enough to illuminate our

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570 
more than enough to illuminate our
subject<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:10.650> shooting<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.190> great

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
subject if we're shooting with a great

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
subject if we're shooting with a great
big<00:01:11.880> wide<00:01:12.270> open<00:01:12.659> aperture<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.230> that's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
big wide open aperture and that's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
big wide open aperture and that's
exactly<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.010> we're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.430> okay

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
exactly what we're going to do okay

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
exactly what we're going to do okay
let's<00:01:15.720> set<00:01:15.870> this<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.170> let's<00:01:16.740> set<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.370> a<00:01:17.550> little

arrive soon I'm gonna light it from
above<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.870> then<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.440> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.620> put<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
above and then I'm going to put a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
above and then I'm going to put a
reflector<00:01:32.430> underneath<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> lighter<00:01:33.510> from

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
reflector underneath and lighter from

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
reflector underneath and lighter from
below<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.380> well

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.149 

one<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.630> nice<00:01:39.719> things<00:01:39.780> about<00:01:40.159> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
one of the really nice things about the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
one of the really nice things about the
light<00:01:41.670> bank<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.149> it<00:01:42.570> has<00:01:42.780> seven<00:01:43.289> bulbs

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
light bank is it has seven bulbs

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370 
light bank is it has seven bulbs
continuous<00:01:44.579> lighting<00:01:44.820> bulbs<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> could

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
continuous lighting bulbs so you could

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.620 
continuous lighting bulbs so you could
turn<00:01:46.950> some<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> bulbs<00:01:47.939> aren't<00:01:48.210> off<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
turn some of the bulbs aren't off if you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
turn some of the bulbs aren't off if you
need<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.079> fine<00:01:49.500> tune<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.490> power<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
need to fine tune the the power of the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
need to fine tune the the power of the
light<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.810> today<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.289> going<00:01:52.469> to<00:01:52.530> put

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
light but today I'm just going to put

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.010 
light but today I'm just going to put
them<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:54.360> make<00:01:54.390> sure<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.810> some

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
them all on and to make sure that some

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
them all on and to make sure that some
light<00:01:55.229> goes<00:01:55.439> underneath<00:01:55.770> our<00:01:56.069> model<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.490> well

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
light goes underneath our model as well

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.639 
light goes underneath our model as well
I'm<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.179> put<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> little<00:01:57.600> reflector<00:01:58.319> I'm

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
I'm going to put a little reflector I'm

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.139 
I'm going to put a little reflector I'm
just<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.009> tuck<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.549> just

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
just going to tuck that in just

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.520 
just going to tuck that in just
underneath<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.079> light

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
underneath the light

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
underneath the light
so<00:02:01.710> that'll<00:02:01.979> bounce<00:02:02.159> light<00:02:02.520> into<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.479> models

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
so that'll bounce light into the models

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.959 
so that'll bounce light into the models
eyes<00:02:03.929> as<00:02:04.259> well<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> lighting<00:02:05.520> underneath

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
eyes as well as a lighting underneath

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.380 
eyes as well as a lighting underneath
the<00:02:06.149> chin

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.510 

and<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:11.020> idea<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.410> simply<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:11.920> photograph

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
and the idea is simply that I photograph

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.370 
and the idea is simply that I photograph
through<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.420> gap<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.840> middle<00:02:13.960> and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
through the gap in the middle and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.710 
through the gap in the middle and
because<00:02:15.010> we're<00:02:15.160> using<00:02:15.190> such<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.820> small<00:02:16.450> depth

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
because we're using such a small depth

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.090 
because we're using such a small depth
of<00:02:16.930> field<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.560> actually<00:02:17.740> get<00:02:18.040> our

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
of field we can actually get our

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.830 
of field we can actually get our
subjects<00:02:18.700> really<00:02:19.030> close<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.690> background

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
subjects really close to the background

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.050 
subjects really close to the background
so<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:20.860> sort<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.070> work<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.370> ideal<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.910> you're

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
so this sort of work is ideal if you're

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.850 
so this sort of work is ideal if you're
working<00:02:22.240> in<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.510> very<00:02:22.750> small<00:02:22.930> studio

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
working in a very small studio

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.800 
working in a very small studio
environment<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:25.030> other<00:02:25.060> nice<00:02:25.390> side<00:02:25.780> effect

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
environment the other nice side effect

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350 
environment the other nice side effect
of<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:27.070> our<00:02:27.190> main<00:02:27.640> light<00:02:27.850> our<00:02:28.060> key

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
of that is that our main light our key

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.420 
of that is that our main light our key
light<00:02:28.600> will<00:02:29.110> not<00:02:29.260> only<00:02:29.410> light<00:02:29.680> our<00:02:29.890> subject

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
light will not only light our subject

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.190 
light will not only light our subject
but<00:02:30.820> it'll<00:02:30.940> also<00:02:31.030> throw<00:02:31.420> some<00:02:31.450> light<00:02:31.810> onto<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
but it'll also throw some light onto the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.330 
but it'll also throw some light onto the
background<00:02:32.500> as<00:02:32.920> well<00:02:35.010> okay<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.070> there<00:02:36.250> we<00:02:36.280> are

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
background as well okay so there we are

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.640 
background as well okay so there we are
that's<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.030> light<00:02:37.209> setup<00:02:37.540> next<00:02:38.440> thing<00:02:38.560> to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
that's the the light setup next thing to

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.970 
that's the the light setup next thing to
do<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.250> grab<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.430> camera<00:02:39.940> let's<00:02:40.330> talk<00:02:40.480> lenses

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
do is to grab a camera let's talk lenses

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.199 
do is to grab a camera let's talk lenses
so<00:02:41.980> when<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.190> comes<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.490> depth<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.910> field

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
so when it comes to depth of field

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.600 
so when it comes to depth of field
you're<00:02:43.450> talking<00:02:44.080> aperture<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.459> you're

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
you're talking aperture so you're

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.280 
you're talking aperture so you're
looking<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> lens<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.510> has<00:02:46.570> an<00:02:46.870> aperture

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
looking for a lens that has an aperture

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.370 
looking for a lens that has an aperture
of<00:02:47.680> f/4<00:02:48.330> as<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.600> biggest<00:02:49.900> probable<00:02:50.350> number

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
of f/4 as the biggest probable number

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.800 
of f/4 as the biggest probable number
but<00:02:51.190> even<00:02:51.640> better<00:02:51.850> would<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.360> lens<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.660> has

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
but even better would be a lens that has

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.490 
but even better would be a lens that has
an<00:02:52.930> aperture<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.260> f28<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:55.080> maybe<00:02:56.080> that'll<00:02:56.320> be

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
an aperture of f28 and maybe that'll be

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.920 
an aperture of f28 and maybe that'll be
this<00:02:57.250> little<00:02:57.640> beast<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.150> lens<00:02:58.330> right<00:02:58.600> here

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
this little beast of a lens right here

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.240 
this little beast of a lens right here
this<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.170> my<00:02:59.380> 70<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.100> 200<00:03:00.280> F<00:03:00.930> 2.8<00:03:01.930> now<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.220> a

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
this is my 70 to 200 F 2.8 now this is a

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.400 
this is my 70 to 200 F 2.8 now this is a
seriously<00:03:03.880> expensive<00:03:04.030> piece<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:05.110> glass

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
seriously expensive piece of glass

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.210 
seriously expensive piece of glass
however<00:03:06.280> there's<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.790> cheaper<00:03:07.209> alternative

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
however there's a cheaper alternative

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.949 
however there's a cheaper alternative
and<00:03:09.220> that's<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.030> thing<00:03:10.239> right<00:03:10.270> here<00:03:10.840> now

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
and that's this thing right here now

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.490 
and that's this thing right here now
this<00:03:11.170> little<00:03:11.470> thing<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> 50<00:03:12.700> millimeter<00:03:12.880> F

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
this little thing is a 50 millimeter F

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.410 
this little thing is a 50 millimeter F
one<00:03:14.500> point<00:03:14.830> eight<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:15.820> an<00:03:15.880> even<00:03:16.180> bigger

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
one point eight so it's an even bigger

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.350 
one point eight so it's an even bigger
aperture<00:03:16.870> giving<00:03:17.350> an<00:03:17.440> even<00:03:17.950> smaller<00:03:18.430> depth<00:03:19.120> of

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
aperture giving an even smaller depth of

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.810 
aperture giving an even smaller depth of
field<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.410> if<00:03:20.769> you're<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> budget

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
field so if you're on a budget

get yourself an F 1.8 hey but if you've
got<00:03:24.459> money<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.940> burn

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
got money to burn

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.070 
set in aperture priority mode I've
dialed<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.830> F<00:03:46.980> 2.8<00:03:47.700> which<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.030> wide<00:03:48.390> open<00:03:48.420> I'm

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
dialed in F 2.8 which is wide open I'm

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.110 
dialed in F 2.8 which is wide open I'm
ready<00:03:49.710> to<00:03:49.890> go<00:03:50.010> let's<00:03:50.220> take<00:03:50.370> some<00:03:50.580> pictures

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120

so<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.260> started<00:04:05.800> with<00:04:05.890> a<00:04:05.950> straight<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.430> shot<00:04:06.460> I'm

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
so I started with a straight on shot I'm

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.120 
so I started with a straight on shot I'm
now<00:04:07.270> going<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.480> move<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> slight<00:04:08.230> side<00:04:08.650> angle

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
now going to move to a slight side angle

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.100 
now going to move to a slight side angle
which<00:04:09.460> should<00:04:09.670> give<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.850> different<00:04:10.180> depth<00:04:10.900> of

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
which should give a different depth of

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.390 
which should give a different depth of
field<00:04:11.260> effect<00:04:12.180> okay<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.890> let's<00:04:14.890> go<00:04:15.100> this<00:04:15.250> way

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
field effect okay and let's go this way

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.979 
field effect okay and let's go this way
so<00:04:15.460> if<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:15.730> look<00:04:15.880> over<00:04:16.000> towards<00:04:16.420> that<00:04:16.480> light

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
so if you look over towards that light

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.460 
so if you look over towards that light
stand<00:04:17.260> there<00:04:17.500> for<00:04:17.799> me<00:04:18.010> okay<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.870> then<00:04:20.170> bring

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
stand there for me okay and then bring

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
stand there for me okay and then bring
your<00:04:20.620> eyes<00:04:20.739> back<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.070> me

one<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.730> nice<00:04:28.850> things<00:04:28.880> about<00:04:29.120> working

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
one of the nice things about working

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.300 
one of the nice things about working
with<00:04:29.720> continuous<00:04:30.290> light<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.740> there<00:04:31.040> isn't<00:04:31.160> any

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
with continuous light is there isn't any

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.940 
with continuous light is there isn't any
flashes<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.150> go<00:04:32.300> off<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.750> there's<00:04:32.870> no<00:04:32.950> waiting

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
flashes to go off and there's no waiting

for<00:04:34.160> them<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.400> recycle<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.210> can<00:04:35.390> just<00:04:35.570> keep

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
for them to recycle so you can just keep

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.410 
for them to recycle so you can just keep
snapping<00:04:36.410> away<00:04:36.880> another<00:04:37.880> good<00:04:38.090> thing<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.240> do

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
snapping away another good thing to do

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.060 
snapping away another good thing to do
as<00:04:38.540> well<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:39.020> check<00:04:39.590> as<00:04:39.770> you're<00:04:39.920> going

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
as well is to check as you're going

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.310 
as well is to check as you're going
along<00:04:40.280> because<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:41.060> depth<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.420> field<00:04:41.600> is<00:04:41.750> so

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
along because the depth of field is so

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.100 
along because the depth of field is so
small<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:44.030> chances<00:04:44.450> are<00:04:44.570> that<00:04:44.630> getting

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
small the the chances are that getting

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.840 
small the the chances are that getting
that<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.440> focus<00:04:45.860> point<00:04:46.100> spot-on<00:04:46.400> won't

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
that the focus point spot-on won't

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.970 
that the focus point spot-on won't
happen<00:04:47.090> every<00:04:47.450> single<00:04:47.660> time<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.380> just<00:04:48.770> make

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
happen every single time so just make

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.770 
happen every single time so just make
sure<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:49.130> you're<00:04:49.370> getting<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:49.850> in<00:04:50.090> focus

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.380 
sure that you're getting it in focus
more<00:04:51.260> often<00:04:51.500> than<00:04:51.650> not<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:52.880> final<00:04:53.120> little

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
more often than not and a final little

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.450 
more often than not and a final little
tip<00:04:53.570> as<00:04:53.690> well<00:04:53.720> try<00:04:54.230> changing<00:04:54.860> your<00:04:55.010> elevation

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
tip as well try changing your elevation

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.910 
tip as well try changing your elevation
compared<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.390> your<00:04:56.510> model<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.050> try<00:04:57.620> getting

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
compared to your model so try getting

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.530 
compared to your model so try getting
higher<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.580> always<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.880> good<00:04:59.090> way<00:04:59.210> so<00:04:59.270> you're

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
higher is always a good way so you're

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.090 
higher is always a good way so you're
looking<00:04:59.660> slightly<00:05:00.020> down<00:05:00.470> onto<00:05:00.860> your<00:05:00.890> model

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
looking slightly down onto your model

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.650 
looking slightly down onto your model
again<00:05:01.820> with<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:02.000> shallow<00:05:02.270> depth<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.600> field

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
again with that shallow depth of field

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.660 
again with that shallow depth of field
that's<00:05:03.230> going<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.440> make<00:05:03.590> some<00:05:03.800> great-looking

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670
