00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.509
 bonsai my dear sims friends and 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.109
 here again at sims 4 who would have it 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.000
 thought 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.940
 and I want you a little 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.670
 show how to do it 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:24.630
 Enlarges and reduces the keyword 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 combinations I will then you too 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.270
 Show the key combination 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.370
 and that is actually quite easy 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.899
 pressed once the shift button the big one 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.590
 Write key and then press next to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.550
 question mark on the keyboard right 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.289
 next to it 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 the one button because I think that's one 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.680
 apostrophic presses therefore shift and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 August gets the mouse moving then once 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.239
 you see, aha, it gets bigger and it does 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.810
 could any I groÃŸmann pressures up 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.619
 believe it clicked 34 times 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.560
 yes then it will be great the map you 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.770
 Here could sit down if it is him 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.409
 the little one wants to push you then 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.960
 Shift again and press this time 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.330
 questionmark 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.939
 if you move the mouse sees the ahs 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.950
 is again smaller but piece by piece 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.189
 will be smaller then if he of course 1000 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.770
 mark will click again 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 standard size at some point we ask 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.250
 that again 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.260
 so reminds us back to normal so there is 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.180
 one more thing I want to tell you 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:54.740
 and the things can not be smaller 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.659
 be made as you are so the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.190
 default value can not be changed 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.380
 if it shrinks us that goes 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.429
 Unfortunately does not work 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.910
 zoom in so zoom out the dacs 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.519
 that this is the biggest one here 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.370
 it is not working yet 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.830
 as it now looks at flowers knows 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.510
 I do not but I think there is too 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:30.230
 soja you just can not make it smaller 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.790
 do as it is already standard by default 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.700
 But there you can nice things here 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.850
 in the bush is nice enlarge 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.030
 Do not be so great now or yes 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.870
 Enlarge the lama that was quite 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.900
 small 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.750
 if you wanted to see them again 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.620
 standard size is so close already 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:58.400
 pretty puny man was once so big 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.440
 then it looks really great and 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.590
 that was actually what I was 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.120
 wanted to show you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.040
 So you can do nice things with it 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.310
 hire and have fun while 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.159
 Decorate your room or yours 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.349
 garden or park or gym 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.409

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:26.079
