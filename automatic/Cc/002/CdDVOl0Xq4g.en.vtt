can't really keep it off the side so
I'll<00:01:58.130> do<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.430> sides<00:01:58.700> too<00:01:59.060> it<00:02:00.020> won't<00:02:00.350> change

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
the color now I've been keeping this wet

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.550 
the color now I've been keeping this wet
for<00:02:04.340> about<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.600> half<00:02:05.600> an<00:02:05.750> hour<00:02:05.870> or<00:02:06.050> so<00:02:06.260> in<00:02:06.290> other

Rings<00:02:14.020> has<00:02:15.020> not<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.680> actually<00:02:15.980> think<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.310> want

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
Rings has not so I actually think I want

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.290 
Rings has not so I actually think I want
to<00:02:16.490> mix<00:02:16.670> up<00:02:16.820> an<00:02:17.780> even<00:02:18.050> stronger<00:02:18.350> batch<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.300> use

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
to mix up an even stronger batch and use

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:30.190 
to mix up an even stronger batch and use
it<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.690> top<00:02:28.660> now<00:02:29.660> I'll<00:02:29.870> apply<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
it on this top now I'll apply the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.850 
it on this top now I'll apply the
stronger<00:02:30.800> solution<00:02:32.410> there<00:02:33.410> not<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> wait<00:02:33.830> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
stronger solution there not the wait a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.710 
stronger solution there not the wait a
while<00:02:34.330> see<00:02:35.330> how<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.660> works

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.260 

all<00:02:41.230> right<00:02:41.380> I've<00:02:41.500> left<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:41.830> dry<00:02:42.100> overnight<00:02:42.270> I

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
all right I've left this dry overnight I

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.500 
all right I've left this dry overnight I
can<00:02:43.990> still<00:02:44.290> see<00:02:44.620> shadows<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:46.000> some<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.420> these

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
can still see shadows of some of these

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.540 
can still see shadows of some of these
rings<00:02:46.870> that's<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.320> little<00:02:47.530> disappointing<00:02:48.400> but

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
rings that's a little disappointing but

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.770 
rings that's a little disappointing but
what<00:02:48.670> I'm<00:02:48.760> gonna<00:02:48.850> do<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.120> rinse<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.570> off

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
what I'm gonna do is rinse this off

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.020 
what I'm gonna do is rinse this off
really<00:02:50.230> well<00:02:50.260> it's<00:02:50.890> important<00:02:51.490> after<00:02:51.880> using

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
really well it's important after using

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.290 
really well it's important after using
installers<00:02:52.600> who<00:02:53.320> rinse<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.740> off<00:02:53.860> well<00:02:54.300> okay

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
installers who rinse it off well okay

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 
installers who rinse it off well okay
I've<00:02:55.390> let<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> top<00:02:55.900> dry<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.920> Rings<00:02:57.160> are<00:02:57.370> still

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
I've let the top dry the Rings are still

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.730 
I've let the top dry the Rings are still
very<00:02:57.790> faint<00:02:58.210> but<00:02:58.930> I'm<00:02:59.050> gonna<00:02:59.170> see<00:02:59.440> if<00:02:59.560> they

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
very faint but I'm gonna see if they

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.720 
very faint but I'm gonna see if they
sand<00:03:00.250> out

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.100 

all<00:03:08.730> right<00:03:08.940> I've<00:03:09.090> sanded<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:09.510> really<00:03:09.900> well

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
all right I've sanded this really well

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.850 
all right I've sanded this really well
with<00:03:10.290> 100<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:10.950> 150<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:12.480> certainly<00:03:13.170> can't<00:03:13.530> see

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
with 100 and 150 I certainly can't see

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.280 
with 100 and 150 I certainly can't see
much<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.670> Rings<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.540> next<00:03:15.810> step<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.140> to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
much of the Rings the next step is to

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.339 
much of the Rings the next step is to
stain<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.560> sometimes<00:03:17.220> when<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.519> stain<00:03:17.760> it

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
stain it sometimes when you stain it

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.440 
stain it sometimes when you stain it
the<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.650> rings<00:03:19.890> response<00:03:20.370> may<00:03:20.700> reappear

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the the rings response may reappear

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.930 
the the rings response may reappear
someone<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.590> know<00:03:23.250> I've<00:03:23.549> gotten<00:03:23.849> them

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
someone but I I know I've gotten them

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.680 
someone but I I know I've gotten them
off<00:03:24.120> as<00:03:24.299> well<00:03:24.540> as<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.840> can<00:03:26.239> all<00:03:27.239> right<00:03:27.299> here's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
off as well as I can all right here's

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.170 
off as well as I can all right here's
the<00:03:27.750> moment<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.200> truth

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the moment of truth

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.780 
the moment of truth
say<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.269> with<00:03:30.420> God<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.829> great<00:03:35.069> really<00:03:35.640> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
say it with God this is great really I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.259 
say it with God this is great really I
don't<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.180> any<00:03:36.360> trace<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:38.030> Rings<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
don't see any trace of the Rings and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.400 
don't see any trace of the Rings and
water<00:03:39.599> spots<00:03:41.180> there's<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.269> spot<00:03:42.629> here<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:43.319> was

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
water spots there's a spot here that was

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.349 
water spots there's a spot here that was
the<00:03:43.530> biggest<00:03:43.709> ring<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:44.430> then<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.000> bunch<00:03:45.180> of

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
the biggest ring and then a bunch of

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.069 
the biggest ring and then a bunch of
spots<00:03:45.540> over<00:03:45.989> here<00:03:47.239> I'll<00:03:48.239> seal<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.660> with<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> coat

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
spots over here I'll seal it with a coat

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.349 
spots over here I'll seal it with a coat
of<00:03:49.109> shellac<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.859> then<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.700> think<00:03:50.910> I'll<00:03:51.090> give<00:03:51.269> it

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
of shellac and then I think I'll give it

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.990 
of shellac and then I think I'll give it
a<00:03:51.420> couple<00:03:51.629> of<00:03:51.810> coats<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.200> polyurethane<00:03:53.000> okay

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
a couple of coats of polyurethane okay

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.330 
a couple of coats of polyurethane okay
somebody<00:03:54.450> decides<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.049> put<00:03:55.530> plants<00:03:55.799> on<00:03:56.159> this

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
somebody decides to put plants on this

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.509 
somebody decides to put plants on this
thing<00:03:56.549> again<00:03:59.959> okay

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
thing again okay

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.550

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
you're gonna see with the top all done

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.770
