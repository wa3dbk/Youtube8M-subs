disadvantage<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.869> this<00:01:10.990> approach<00:01:11.409> is<00:01:11.679> that

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
disadvantage to this approach is that

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.099 
disadvantage to this approach is that
they<00:01:12.310> lack<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.579> efficiency<00:01:13.359> of<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.600> tycoon's

they lack the efficiency of the tycoon's

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.679 
they lack the efficiency of the tycoon's
and<00:01:14.500> they<00:01:15.039> require<00:01:15.460> much<00:01:15.789> more<00:01:16.060> space<00:01:16.359> for

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
and they require much more space for

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.889 
and they require much more space for
their<00:01:16.810> power<00:01:17.020> plants<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.649> operate<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.509> ecos

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
their power plants to operate the ecos

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.929 
their power plants to operate the ecos
have<00:01:20.200> numerous<00:01:20.560> tools<00:01:20.979> which<00:01:21.369> generate<00:01:21.909> a

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
example the ozone generator is able to

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.429 
example the ozone generator is able to
clean<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.030> air<00:01:28.179> and<00:01:28.450> cleanse<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.079> island

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
clean the air and cleanse the island

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.160 
clean the air and cleanse the island
from<00:01:29.619> pollution<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:31.060> tycoon's<00:01:31.539> have<00:01:31.869> fewer

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
from pollution the tycoon's have fewer

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.169 
from pollution the tycoon's have fewer
opportunities<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:33.159> counter<00:01:33.579> pollution<00:01:34.060> and

the<00:01:34.240> tools<00:01:34.960> they<00:01:35.259> have<00:01:35.530> are<00:01:35.829> not<00:01:36.069> as<00:01:36.249> efficient

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
the tools they have are not as efficient

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.389 
the tools they have are not as efficient
as<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.090> eco<00:01:37.450> tools<00:01:37.719> for<00:01:38.710> example<00:01:39.130> they<00:01:39.249> can

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
as the eco tools for example they can

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.489 
as the eco tools for example they can
store<00:01:39.700> their<00:01:39.880> waste<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.270> mountains<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.049> this

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:41.499 
store their waste in mountains and this

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:43.859 
store their waste in mountains and this
will<00:01:41.710> have<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:42.130> positive<00:01:42.460> impact<00:01:42.789> on<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.509> Eco

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
tycoon's will also have the opportunity

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.599 
tycoon's will also have the opportunity
to<00:01:48.939> use<00:01:49.179> eco<00:01:49.689> tools<00:01:49.990> in<00:01:50.409> order<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.159> free<00:01:51.460> the

to use eco tools in order to free the
island<00:01:51.999> from<00:01:52.179> pollution<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.829> example<00:01:54.310> a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
island from pollution for example a

island from pollution for example a
river<00:01:54.819> filter<00:01:55.299> plant<00:01:55.569> will<00:01:55.929> be<00:01:56.020> able<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.439> clean

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
river filter plant will be able to clean

the water on a polluted tycoon island

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.410 
the water on a polluted tycoon island
and<00:01:59.319> will<00:01:59.799> produce<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.280> positive<00:02:00.819> effect<00:02:00.909> on
