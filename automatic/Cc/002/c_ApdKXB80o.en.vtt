 Hello everyone, welcome this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.440
 a tip of minecraft mod today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.810
 we will see a half day 1 point 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.610
 7.10 very interesting and very simple 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.290
 then it's the 15 st map because i have 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.929
 discovered in the other map if I put it in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.429
 one 7 10 all come off quadrucci e 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.139
 all the puppets disappear because 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 set for 18 so I will only do it 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.160
 fashions for 18 so we found the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 settings also for maps 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
 then guys the fashion that soul see 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.260
 today it is called super crafting frame 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.599
 boys 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.400
 and adds three different firsts 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.520
 one of these is called super 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.410
 crafting frame made of crafting note 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.059
 but on the wall and first of all one 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.520
 very peculiar feature i 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 I can shift right and I can take 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.770
 the stacks of stuff in it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.960
 network 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.180
 no, because in practice this is one 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.660
 crafting and kids 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.879
 see you see look then how 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.399
 works right choices gives us the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.469
 grafting screen I go to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.930
 take the coop la stone I put in 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.149
 crafting for example the furnace and the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 I put that it takes the objects then the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.270
 coop the stones from the inventory and from 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.430
 player can also only put 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.960
 only player inventory then 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 now doing it this way 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.979
 right-clicking attack us 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.630
 kraft was the crafting note taking 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.040
 the couple is from there I'm taking the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.240
 from my inventory a lot of guys 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.950
 interesting is true 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.710
 ok how you scratch guys let's get to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 see it immediately ok crafting is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.920
 very simple a grappa in the ball e 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.340
 of the sticks just like a frame is in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.310
 practice 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.200
 then we have the boyd here is this comfortable 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.340
 as a trash can boys for what reason 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 then in the meantime he scratches himself in this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.590
 way 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.600
 an pearls and stick so it is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 even this simple by clicking with 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 the right only with the right will do 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.170
 disappear the objects we give ourselves as if 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.180
 was a trash bin if we did the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.259
 right makes all stacks disappear 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.090
 first grade stuff of a 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 type all a blow then we say 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.759
 in a bucket for boys, why 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.840
 can rightly be applied by 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.430
 any part 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.750
 see so it's very convenient 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.850
 actually this year we have 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.100
 robben useful to throw then we have 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.390
 the last of the frames which is a lot 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 particular the same is called super 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.280
 item frame actually makes the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.909
 our beautiful basket a burrell in 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.550
 what meaning 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.140
 here there is a couple and they are trimmed e 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.100
 now I take the coop estonia vi 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.880
 I show 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.130
 look no area on glee with the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.930
 right up here and goblin box you 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.380
 you have to network that is within the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.690
 right shift basket I put it like one 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.230
 beautiful goes a beautiful burrell col 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.050
 right 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.610
 see if I was n't I could recover it 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.220
 I have a bit if with the left it recovers 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.780
 no you can't recover ok need 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.660
 just to enter the differences the bars 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.550
 can only be entered e 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.280
 comfortable the same actually is not 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.230
 bad by is good good and as siggraph 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.350
 this we see a little immediately yes 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.360
 ago with a drop for and stick then 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.610
 indeed they are very easy to 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.070
 craft a lot like saying the usage 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.240
 because anyway the pinch from the wall of is 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.070
 practically to use as 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.430
 quadruccio therefore better than that yes 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.760
