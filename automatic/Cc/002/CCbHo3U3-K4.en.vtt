ghost fragment that I don't know why
they<00:00:22.859> hid<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.189> under<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> map<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.750> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
they hid it under the map but for you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.120 
they hid it under the map but for you
guys<00:00:24.930> who<00:00:25.080> tuned<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.560> last<00:00:25.800> video<00:00:26.070> I

guys who tuned in to the last video I
also<00:00:26.340> said<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> we'd<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.090> exploring<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> RAS

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
also said that we'd be exploring the RAS

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.640 
also said that we'd be exploring the RAS
to<00:00:28.760> bunker<00:00:29.760> now<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.750> follows<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.470> is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
to bunker now what follows with that is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.979 
to bunker now what follows with that is
also<00:00:31.980> does<00:00:32.189> serif<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.600> called<00:00:33.809> as

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
also does serif I think it's called as

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.510 
also does serif I think it's called as
well<00:00:34.200> which<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> another<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.430> know

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
well which which is another you know

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760 
well which which is another you know
hidden<00:00:35.910> tunnel<00:00:36.239> system<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:37.559> not

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
hidden tunnel system that's not

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
hidden tunnel system that's not
accessible<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> beta<00:00:38.760> yet<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.780> looks

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
accessible in the beta yet but it looks

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.720 
accessible in the beta yet but it looks
like<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.350> did<00:00:40.379> start<00:00:40.890> coding<00:00:41.219> into<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> game

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
like they did start coding into the game

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
like they did start coding into the game
so<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.540> guys<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
see here I have done the sparrow

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
see here I have done the sparrow
wallbreach<00:00:45.480> glitch<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.140> under<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> map

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
wallbreach glitch to get under the map

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
wallbreach glitch to get under the map
here<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.309> my<00:00:47.550> previous<00:00:47.910> video<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.329> explained

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
here in my previous video I explained

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.389 
here in my previous video I explained
how<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> wallbreach<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:49.890> bit<00:00:50.010> simpler

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
how to wallbreach a little bit simpler

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
how to wallbreach a little bit simpler
for<00:00:50.610> those<00:00:50.730> who<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.059> don't<00:00:51.390> understand

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
for those who really don't understand

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.139 
for those who really don't understand
but<00:00:52.530> once<00:00:52.949> we're<00:00:53.129> under<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> map<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.850> here's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
but once we're under the map here here's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.330 
but once we're under the map here here's
the<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.660> legends<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.440> ghost<00:00:56.100> fragment

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the little legends to ghost fragment

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.000 
the little legends to ghost fragment
pick<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.590> jump

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
pick that up but right there if you jump
into<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.430> area<00:00:59.699> here<00:01:00.390> there's<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
into this area here there's actually a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
into this area here there's actually a
loading<00:01:01.530> zone<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:02.280> when<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.430> guys<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.789> into

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
loading zone now when you guys get into

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.429 
loading zone now when you guys get into
this<00:01:03.090> loading<00:01:03.510> zone<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> know

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
this loading zone that's when you know

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.020 
this loading zone that's when you know
that<00:01:04.710> they've<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.519> loaded<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that they've actually just loaded the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
that they've actually just loaded the
bunker<00:01:06.780> Ras<00:01:07.439> too<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.369> we'll<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.729> follow

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
bunker Ras too so we'll just follow

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
bunker Ras too so we'll just follow
where<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> go<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> guys<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.530> is

simply drop down below um follow this

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.399 
simply drop down below um follow this
way<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.920> I'm<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.409> look

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
way down I'm just going to kind of look

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.109 
way down I'm just going to kind of look
around<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.950> demonstration<00:01:17.610> purposes<00:01:18.060> just

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
around for demonstration purposes just

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.600 
around for demonstration purposes just
so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> guys<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:18.960> idea<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> how<00:01:20.159> epic

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
so you guys have an idea of how epic

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
so you guys have an idea of how epic
this<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.320> guys<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.680> either

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this really is but you guys can either

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160 
this really is but you guys can either
jump<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.049> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
jump up this way I think it's kind of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.539 
jump up this way I think it's kind of
sketchy<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.920> kind<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.250> slide

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
sketchy because you can kind of slide

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.830 
sketchy because you can kind of slide
off<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.970> your<00:01:27.119> death<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.570> I'd<00:01:27.689> recommend

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
off to your death so I'd recommend

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
off to your death so I'd recommend
actually<00:01:28.590> running<00:01:29.070> around<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> building

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
actually running around the building

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.390 
actually running around the building
here<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.100> sadly

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
