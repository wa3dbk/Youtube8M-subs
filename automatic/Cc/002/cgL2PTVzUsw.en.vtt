00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
bolt if you see right there there's a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
bolt if you see right there there's a
little<00:01:14.040> blue<00:01:14.369> lightning<00:01:14.820> bolt<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.390> hit

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
little blue lightning bolt that just hit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
little blue lightning bolt that just hit
if<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.549> die<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
if you're in that you will die and that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
if you're in that you will die and that
goes<00:01:18.330> through<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> room<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.490> way<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
goes through the room so the way you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
goes through the room so the way you
activate<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.299> glitch<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.630> by<00:01:21.990> setting<00:01:22.200> down

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
activate this glitch is by setting down

activate this glitch is by setting down
a<00:01:22.500> magma<00:01:23.159> totem<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:23.700> after<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.090> pulled<00:01:24.360> this

to<00:01:29.040> pull<00:01:29.250> them<00:01:29.400> back<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.970> room<00:01:30.090> because

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to pull them back into this room because

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.120 
to pull them back into this room because
the<00:01:30.840> lightning<00:01:31.229> bolt<00:01:31.380> will<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.650> gone<00:01:31.829> after

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the door shuts so if you see my magma

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
the door shuts so if you see my magma

here I'm just killing everything along

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.100 
here I'm just killing everything along
the<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.640> will<00:02:18.760> do<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:19.209> fine<00:02:19.300> doing<00:02:19.900> that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
the way you will do just fine doing that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.620 
the way you will do just fine doing that
so<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.340> keep<00:02:21.520> going<00:02:21.700> forward<00:02:22.090> and

so you just keep going forward and

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.449 
so you just keep going forward and
eventually<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.470> will<00:02:23.560> find<00:02:23.830> another<00:02:24.130> one<00:02:24.370> of

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
eventually you will find another one of

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.070 
eventually you will find another one of
these<00:02:24.550> boss<00:02:24.819> mobs<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.630> need<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.870> kill

these boss mobs that you need to kill

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.199 
these boss mobs that you need to kill
but<00:02:27.010> there<00:02:27.220> will<00:02:27.310> be<00:02:27.400> plenty<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.730> trash<00:02:27.940> mobs

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
but there will be plenty of trash mobs

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.670 
but there will be plenty of trash mobs
along<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.630> way<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.840> can<00:02:29.080> kill<00:02:29.260> these<00:02:29.440> it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
along the way you can kill these it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.050 
along the way you can kill these it
doesn't<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.010> matter<00:02:30.190> either<00:02:30.489> way<00:02:30.670> just

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
doesn't really matter either way just

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.660 
doesn't really matter either way just
 should<00:02:32.410> probably<00:02:32.800> kill<00:02:32.980> them<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.400> reduce

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
 should probably kill them to reduce

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.059 
 should probably kill them to reduce
the<00:02:33.850> damage<00:02:33.970> your<00:02:34.270> be<00:02:34.450> taking<00:02:34.750> later<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.950> if

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
the damage your be taking later on so if

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.460

fight<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.579> doesn't<00:03:15.820> bug<00:03:15.970> out<00:03:16.150> now<00:03:16.870> if<00:03:16.989> you

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
fight so it doesn't bug out now if you

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.610

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
see I'm near the room and naturally you

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.530 
see I'm near the room and naturally you
would<00:03:20.799> think<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.160> just<00:03:21.400> go<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
would think you just go in and you

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.319 
would think you just go in and you
attack<00:03:22.810> him<00:03:22.989> but<00:03:23.890> if<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.459> do<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:24.700> too<00:03:24.730> fast<00:03:25.000> he

will bug out and it's annoying as

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.319 
will bug out and it's annoying as
because<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.190> actually<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.820> restart<00:03:28.180> the

flight now if you see I'm looking at the
room<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.810> best<00:03:32.019> way<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.320> know<00:03:32.739> when<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.070> go

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
room and the best way to know when to go

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.940 
room and the best way to know when to go
in<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.970> see<00:03:34.180> if<00:03:34.450> he's<00:03:35.049> attackable<00:03:35.530> if<00:03:35.769> you

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
in is to see if he's attackable if you

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.729 
in is to see if he's attackable if you
can<00:03:36.160> hit<00:03:36.370> him<00:03:36.549> he<00:03:37.000> will<00:03:37.239> not<00:03:37.450> bug<00:03:37.690> out<00:03:37.900> so

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739
