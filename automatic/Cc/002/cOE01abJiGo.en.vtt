my<00:00:45.780> early<00:00:46.110> siberian<00:00:46.649> tomato<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.789> my<00:00:48.800> osu<00:00:49.800> blue

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
my early siberian tomato and my osu blue

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
my early siberian tomato and my osu blue
there's<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.660> little<00:00:51.809> update<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.410> i<00:00:52.940> got

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
there's your little update on that i got

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.870 
there's your little update on that i got
some<00:00:54.120> blossoms<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
some blossoms on it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.990 
some blossoms on it
but<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:56.990> between<00:00:57.620> them<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:57.890> put<00:00:58.220> carrots

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
but in between them I put carrots

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.220 
but in between them I put carrots
I<00:00:59.320> guess<00:01:00.320> carrots<00:01:00.920> are<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.360> companion<00:01:02.360> plant<00:01:02.780> to

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
I guess carrots are a companion plant to

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.520 
I guess carrots are a companion plant to
Tomatoes<00:01:07.390> yeah<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.420> don't<00:01:08.870> know<00:01:09.110> what<00:01:09.320> they<00:01:09.470> do

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
Tomatoes yeah I don't know what they do

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.760 
Tomatoes yeah I don't know what they do
for<00:01:09.980> them<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:10.550> I<00:01:10.790> know<00:01:11.300> they<00:01:12.260> do<00:01:12.320> grow

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
for them but I know they do grow

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.060 
for them but I know they do grow
together<00:01:12.980> very<00:01:13.490> well<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.140> they<00:01:15.140> somehow<00:01:15.770> they

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
together very well and they somehow they

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.310 
together very well and they somehow they
benefit<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.420> that's<00:01:17.690> something<00:01:17.930> I'm<00:01:18.140> trying

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
benefit so that's something I'm trying

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.190 
benefit so that's something I'm trying
this<00:01:18.620> year<00:01:19.120> I'll<00:01:20.120> try<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.510> look<00:01:20.630> into<00:01:20.900> it<00:01:21.110> a

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
this year I'll try and look into it a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.900 
this year I'll try and look into it a
little<00:01:21.380> bit<00:01:21.560> more<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.950> future<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.490> let

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
little bit more in the future and let

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.880 
little bit more in the future and let
you<00:01:23.030> know<00:01:23.180> what<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.900> is<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:24.350> they<00:01:24.470> do<00:01:24.530> for

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
you know what it is that they do for

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.670 
you know what it is that they do for
each<00:01:25.010> other<00:01:25.840> another<00:01:26.840> one<00:01:27.050> that<00:01:27.229> goes<00:01:27.410> good

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
each other another one that goes good

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.969 
each other another one that goes good
with<00:01:27.830> tomatoes<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.520> basil<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.390> I'm<00:01:30.320> guessing

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
with tomatoes is basil and I'm guessing

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.060 
with tomatoes is basil and I'm guessing
basil<00:01:31.490> because<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.440> scent<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.710> probably

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
basil because of the scent it probably

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.870 
basil because of the scent it probably
attracts<00:01:34.580> good<00:01:35.180> pollinating<00:01:35.869> insects<00:01:36.880> but

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
attracts good pollinating insects but

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.870 
attracts good pollinating insects but
anyway<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:39.530> that's<00:01:39.920> my<00:01:40.130> short<00:01:40.340> little<00:01:40.520> video

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
anyway that that's my short little video

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.740 
anyway that that's my short little video
and<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:42.140> just<00:01:42.380> wanted<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.680> let<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.310> know<00:01:43.750> you
