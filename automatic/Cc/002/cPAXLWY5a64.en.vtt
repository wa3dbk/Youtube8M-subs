aight farming basis i found these bases
while<00:00:19.230> searching<00:00:19.650> through<00:00:20.640> yet<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.300> by

while searching through yet just by
searching<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:23.630> some<00:00:24.630> base<00:00:24.869> i<00:00:25.140> made<00:00:25.350> by<00:00:25.500> myself

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
searching and some base i made by myself

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
searching and some base i made by myself
but<00:00:26.279> yeah<00:00:26.519> that's<00:00:26.970> pretty<00:00:27.150> much<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.750> i<00:00:27.810> want

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
but yeah that's pretty much all i want

but yeah that's pretty much all i want
to<00:00:28.380> say<00:00:28.640> but<00:00:29.640> also<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:30.510> bases<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:31.080> not

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to say but also that these bases are not

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.190 
to say but also that these bases are not
in<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.070> particular<00:00:32.369> order<00:00:32.610> from<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:34.020> i

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
in a in a particular order from what i

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.819 
in a in a particular order from what i
think<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> top<00:00:35.280> 5<00:00:35.550> best<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
random order so yeah we're just going to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.040 
random order so yeah we're just going to

phase in yet it is a really nice basis
again<00:01:50.310> sort<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.939> trap<00:01:51.299> base<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.920> got

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
again sort of trap base it got

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.760 
again sort of trap base it got
everything<00:01:53.820> nice<00:01:54.000> triangle<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:55.049> there's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
everything nice triangle but there's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.200 
everything nice triangle but there's
something<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> don't<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.090> is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
something what I don't like what is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.709 
something what I don't like what is
basing<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.840> these<00:01:58.590> two<00:01:58.860> waters<00:01:59.369> are

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
basing that this these two waters are

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.969 
basing that this these two waters are
really<00:02:00.719> close<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.140> each<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.860> like

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
really close to each other just like

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.149 
really close to each other just like
these<00:02:02.280> two<00:02:02.340> air<00:02:02.700> defenses<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.920> use<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
these two air defenses and if you use a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
these two air defenses and if you use a
free<00:02:05.520> spill<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> don't<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> your<00:02:06.659> get

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
free spill I don't think that your get

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.219 
free spill I don't think that your get
attacked<00:02:07.290> by<00:02:07.380> three<00:02:07.649> spell<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:09.229> they

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
attacked by three spell but if they

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.860 
attacked by three spell but if they
could<00:02:10.410> freeze<00:02:10.739> these<00:02:11.340> two<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> same<00:02:12.569> time

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
could freeze these two at the same time

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
could freeze these two at the same time
just<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.260> this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
just like this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.140 
just like this
fences<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:15.590> yeah<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.520> cold

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
fences and yeah that and this cold

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.170 
fences and yeah that and this cold
storage<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.320> little<00:02:20.040> bit<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.340> outside<00:02:20.970> those

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
storage is a little bit on outside those

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.550 
storage is a little bit on outside those
are<00:02:21.330> things<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.810> don't<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.110> about<00:02:22.260> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
are things that I don't like about it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.360 
are things that I don't like about it
ended<00:02:23.160> with<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> towers<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:25.130> not<00:02:26.130> so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
ended with the towers are not so

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.810 
ended with the towers are not so
centralized<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:27.770> overall<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.490> good

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
centralized but overall it is a good

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.090 
centralized but overall it is a good
base<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.600> don't<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:30.870> you're<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.440> easy<00:02:31.710> to

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
base I don't think you're get easy to

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.480 
base I don't think you're get easy to
restart<00:02:32.490> with<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.850> because<00:02:33.380> yeah<00:02:34.380> you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
restart with it because yeah you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.950 
restart with it because yeah you
everywhere<00:02:35.490> are<00:02:35.700> traps<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.360> business<00:02:36.810> on

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
everywhere are traps in this business on

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.720 
everywhere are traps in this business on
Katherine<00:02:37.350> which<00:02:37.530> side<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.010> attack<00:02:38.430> they

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
Katherine which side you attack they

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.140 
Katherine which side you attack they
always<00:02:39.120> go<00:02:39.330> first<00:02:39.600> for<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.050> mine<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.220> Archer

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
always go first for this mine and Archer

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.390 
always go first for this mine and Archer
tower<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.690> then<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:42.900> got<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.320> whole<00:02:43.830> row<00:02:44.160> of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
tower and then they got a whole row of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.550 
tower and then they got a whole row of
traps<00:02:45.000> going<00:02:45.390> off<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:45.900> pretty<00:02:46.200> nice

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
traps going off so that's pretty nice

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.790 
traps going off so that's pretty nice
and<00:02:46.830> solid<00:02:47.070> about<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.640> base<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:49.200> everything

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and solid about this base so everything

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.270 
and solid about this base so everything
is<00:02:49.920> nice<00:02:50.130> spread<00:02:50.550> around<00:02:50.730> based<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.709> not

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
is nice spread around based it is not

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.590 
is nice spread around based it is not
yeah<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.420> all<00:02:54.930> over<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.770> base<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.250> base

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
yeah it is all over the base this base

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.390 
yeah it is all over the base this base
so<00:02:57.600> there's<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> pretty<00:02:58.260> nice<00:02:58.590> solid<00:02:59.130> base

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
so there's a pretty nice solid base

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.360 
so there's a pretty nice solid base
really<00:02:59.970> recommend<00:03:00.480> using<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.230> there's<00:03:02.130> not<00:03:02.310> a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
really recommend using it there's not a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.730 
really recommend using it there's not a
speed<00:03:02.820> build<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.450> base<00:03:03.840> because<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> made

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
speed build of this base because I made

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.290 
speed build of this base because I made
it<00:03:04.860> by<00:03:05.010> myself<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.790> did<00:03:05.940> not<00:03:06.060> make<00:03:06.180> this

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
it by myself and I did not make this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.530 
it by myself and I did not make this
people<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:07.230> yeah<00:03:07.459> overall<00:03:08.459> nice<00:03:08.760> base<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
people but yeah overall nice base and

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.710 
people but yeah overall nice base and
let's<00:03:10.080> move<00:03:10.320> on<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.800> our<00:03:10.890> next<00:03:11.100> base<00:03:14.420> hey<00:03:15.420> guys

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
let's move on to our next base hey guys

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.680 
let's move on to our next base hey guys
we're<00:03:16.140> back<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.920> if<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:17.940> see<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.330> got<00:03:18.510> now

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
we're back and if you can see we got now

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.940 
we're back and if you can see we got now
this<00:03:18.900> new<00:03:19.709> beauty<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.580> base<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.620> see

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
this new beauty of a base if you can see

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.120 
this new beauty of a base if you can see
Moores<00:03:23.700> are<00:03:23.940> perfectly<00:03:24.750> triangle<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.950> like

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
Moores are perfectly triangle just like

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.150 
Moores are perfectly triangle just like
the<00:03:26.310> air<00:03:26.459> defense<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.720> only<00:03:28.140> things<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
the air defense the only things that I

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.440 
the air defense the only things that I
don't<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:29.580> about<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:29.940> base<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
don't like about this base is the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.199 
don't like about this base is the
placement<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.350> Wizards<00:03:31.860> hours<00:03:32.310> they're

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
placement of the Wizards hours they're

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.570 
placement of the Wizards hours they're
not<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.690> perfect<00:03:34.320> triangle<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> dark

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
not in a perfect triangle and the dark

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.110 
not in a perfect triangle and the dark
elixir<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:36.180> not<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.840> much<00:03:37.190> yeah<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.670> sender

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
elixir is not so much yeah to the sender

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.810 
elixir is not so much yeah to the sender
if<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.959> want<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.410> could<00:03:40.590> change<00:03:41.040> them<00:03:41.430> up<00:03:41.610> by

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
if you want you could change them up by

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.979 
if you want you could change them up by
just<00:03:42.120> changing<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.380> gold<00:03:44.160> gold<00:03:44.910> storage<00:03:45.480> and

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
just changing this gold gold storage and

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.410 
just changing this gold gold storage and
place<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.410> right<00:03:46.560> here<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.910> dark<00:03:48.180> elixir

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
place it right here and the dark elixir

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.050 
place it right here and the dark elixir
stores<00:03:49.050> right<00:03:49.260> here<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.489> then<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.880> get<00:03:51.000> a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
stores right here and then you get a

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.800 
stores right here and then you get a
kind<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.630> pen<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.620> left<00:03:52.769> to

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
kind of pen but then you left to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.600 
kind of pen but then you left to
storages<00:03:54.810> with<00:03:55.140> gold<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.920> Alex<00:03:56.220> are<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.519> the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
storages with gold and Alex are in the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.880 
storages with gold and Alex are in the
same<00:03:56.820> compartment<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:58.320> thats<00:03:58.470> not<00:03:58.620> pretty

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
same compartment so thats not pretty

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.210 
same compartment so thats not pretty
nice<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.570> traps<00:04:01.140> are<00:04:01.500> most<00:04:01.950> likely

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
nice and the traps are most likely

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.960 
nice and the traps are most likely
outside<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.480> base<00:04:03.830> but<00:04:04.830> yeah<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.190> got<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
outside of the base but yeah you got the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.410 
outside of the base but yeah you got the
air<00:04:06.120> bombs<00:04:06.450> inside<00:04:07.130> this<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.370> kind<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.880> inside

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
air bombs inside this is kind of inside

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.620 
air bombs inside this is kind of inside
and<00:04:09.780> then<00:04:10.080> you've<00:04:10.200> got<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.470> test<00:04:10.739> class<00:04:11.010> all

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
and then you've got the test class all

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.440 
and then you've got the test class all
on<00:04:12.630> perfect<00:04:13.260> placement<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.880> giant<00:04:15.150> bomb

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
on perfect placement and a giant bomb

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.210 
on perfect placement and a giant bomb
worth<00:04:15.600> here<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.080> walk<00:04:16.320> right<00:04:16.560> into<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.040> but

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
worth here to walk right into it but

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.699 
worth here to walk right into it but
yeah<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:18.330> like<00:04:18.479> this<00:04:18.660> base<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.410> base

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
yeah I really like this base this base

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.390 
yeah I really like this base this base
is<00:04:19.739> actually<00:04:20.130> built<00:04:20.370> by<00:04:20.580> myself<00:04:21.180> but<00:04:21.540> yeah

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
is actually built by myself but yeah

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.770 
is actually built by myself but yeah
really<00:04:23.400> like<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.850> space<00:04:23.910> also<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.600> is

storage in the center and clan castle

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.570 
storage in the center and clan castle
it's<00:06:33.300> got<00:06:33.569> the<00:06:33.689> are<00:06:33.839> 2,000<00:06:34.319> cannons<00:06:34.800> nice<00:06:35.250> or

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
it's got the are 2,000 cannons nice or

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.170 
it's got the are 2,000 cannons nice or
just<00:06:35.759> our<00:06:35.879> cannon<00:06:36.330> arch<00:06:36.509> at<00:06:36.659> our<00:06:36.779> cannon<00:06:37.169> and

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
just our cannon arch at our cannon and

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.940 
just our cannon arch at our cannon and
this<00:06:39.180> thing<00:06:39.360> were<00:06:39.539> the<00:06:39.569> most<00:06:39.870> likely

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
this thing were the most likely

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.860 
this thing were the most likely
like<00:06:41.130> about<00:06:41.490> this<00:06:41.610> base<00:06:41.820> that<00:06:42.150> is<00:06:42.300> a<00:06:42.330> trap<00:06:42.690> base

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
like about this base that is a trap base

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.630 
like about this base that is a trap base
because<00:06:43.200> if<00:06:43.350> you<00:06:43.440> can<00:06:43.500> see<00:06:43.800> right<00:06:43.830> here<00:06:44.070> only

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
because if you can see right here only

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.150 
because if you can see right here only
already<00:06:45.030> on<00:06:45.240> this<00:06:45.360> side<00:06:45.420> you<00:06:45.630> got<00:06:45.930> if<00:06:46.890> they

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
already on this side you got if they

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.280 
already on this side you got if they
attack<00:06:47.490> with<00:06:47.670> giants<00:06:48.060> or<00:06:48.180> so<00:06:48.330> they<00:06:48.690> first<00:06:49.110> go

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
attack with giants or so they first go

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.260 
attack with giants or so they first go
for<00:06:49.530> this<00:06:49.620> skin<00:06:49.980> and<00:06:50.250> it<00:06:50.460> doesn't<00:06:50.790> care<00:06:51.090> where

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
for this skin and it doesn't care where

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.090 
for this skin and it doesn't care where
they<00:06:51.450> attack<00:06:51.810> from<00:06:51.990> this<00:06:52.170> side<00:06:52.470> if<00:06:52.710> for<00:06:52.950> them

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
they attack from this side if for them

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.460 
they attack from this side if for them
to<00:06:53.220> take<00:06:53.430> this<00:06:53.610> cannon<00:06:54.090> or<00:06:54.210> this<00:06:54.360> game<00:06:54.660> so<00:06:55.290> they

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
to take this cannon or this game so they

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.450 
to take this cannon or this game so they
woke<00:06:56.070> in<00:06:56.400> spring<00:06:57.120> trip<00:06:57.360> a<00:06:57.600> bomb<00:06:58.340> after<00:06:59.340> that

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
woke in spring trip a bomb after that

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.520 
woke in spring trip a bomb after that
they<00:06:59.640> woke<00:06:59.790> again<00:07:00.030> in<00:07:00.510> a<00:07:00.600> bomb<00:07:00.810> and<00:07:01.050> a<00:07:01.110> spring

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
they woke again in a bomb and a spring

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.680 
they woke again in a bomb and a spring
trap<00:07:01.800> and<00:07:02.010> after<00:07:02.430> that<00:07:02.550> in<00:07:02.790> a<00:07:02.880> giant<00:07:03.180> bombs<00:07:03.480> are

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
trap and after that in a giant bombs are

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.570 
trap and after that in a giant bombs are
your<00:07:03.840> most<00:07:04.050> likely<00:07:04.410> screwed<00:07:04.800> it<00:07:05.100> doesn't<00:07:05.400> care

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
your most likely screwed it doesn't care

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.750 
your most likely screwed it doesn't care
from<00:07:05.760> which<00:07:06.060> I<00:07:06.360> do<00:07:06.420> tech<00:07:07.250> except<00:07:08.250> if<00:07:08.400> you<00:07:08.520> drop

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
from which I do tech except if you drop

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.540 
from which I do tech except if you drop
some<00:07:09.000> more<00:07:09.240> breakers<00:07:09.690> will<00:07:09.870> go<00:07:10.020> to<00:07:10.100> hear<00:07:11.100> but

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
some more breakers will go to hear but

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.050 
some more breakers will go to hear but
that<00:07:12.450> will<00:07:12.630> not<00:07:12.750> happen<00:07:12.930> I<00:07:13.460> think<00:07:14.460> I<00:07:14.550> guarantee
