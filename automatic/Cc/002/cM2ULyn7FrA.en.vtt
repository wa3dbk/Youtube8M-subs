00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.799
 Greetings and welcome to the review 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.510
 of the magnum bz wbk starfighter knife 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.000
 this costs about 19 euros on Amazon 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.349
 link in the description 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.670
 and I'll just put it this way 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.640
 fast as possible and short crisp 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.430
 that the packaging in the scanner yes 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.230
 simply designed and then we do that 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.340
 Partie from here come then the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 metal box I'm assuming that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.600
 aluminum is similar in optics 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.469
 the knife itself is indexed and what 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 one as the box house is one 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.460
 machines upholstered as it of course 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.930
 another slide so and aside 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.129
 Here we come to the knife itself 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.539
 as you can see it is either 19 euros 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 so you can not expect too much 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.930
 although i am very happy if i am 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.070
 can not say that is inferior 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.250
 or the like which is the wood, respectively 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.229
 two screws attached 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.260
 also on the back and on this 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.659
 side one finds also the belt clip of 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.979
 First, pretty much whether you like it or not 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.950
 not that you know that, yes 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.990
 whole looks like aluminum is clean 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.380
 did not really coat now 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.460
 but free scratched so I go 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.750
 Let's assume it's one 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.490
 sharp object or who to vote 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.549
 something scratched by steinfeld 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.270
 yes, I have not had it long yet 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450
 tested 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.619
 I will let you know if there can be 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.180
 but I will have deficiencies 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.829
 it did not really use me much 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.320
 going at it when I have time a 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.570
 problem area or similar because 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.340
 Now we come to the main features 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.149
 is not a real spring knife 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.810
 but it can be the right moment 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.100
 touch so you have already seen how 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.960
 you open and I show you bad 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.290
 if you close the thing to the side 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.140
 and then it works again 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.310
 can thus end 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.670
 stand stupid because you just take yours 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.850
 index finger best goes here then 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.480
 snaps that 'll be on it goes very much 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.530
 comfortable fast and yes it looks 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.140
 threatening when you get here 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.550
 still wants to go so with it 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.959
 threaten somehow 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.040
 I do not know what else to do with it 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.709
 it should be a kind of legal 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.030
 springmesser halfway I would 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.560
 not to use camping i would 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.450
 to use no idea 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.090
 it is not inconceivable schaaf is 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.239
 it is it is not quite dull 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:58.370
 but from now on you can go fast too 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:00.070
 only conditionally so is schaaf if you are 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.190
 of course you can sharpen 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.200
 now is not a very sharp knife he 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.920
 she is cool for the look 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.340
 and maybe serves as a deterrent 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.750
 always 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.370
 Of course you should have yourself as a weapon 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.790
 but everyone should do that themselves 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.980
 to find out for yourself 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.890
 Yes, I do not regret the fight 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.870
 case the whole thing looks really cool 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.170
 and depends on what you use 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.549
 want 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.260
 if for example for fishing now 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.329
 used to stabs the fish 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.100
 to stab once in the neck or 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.440
 it's pretty good, too 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.790
 or just 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.020
 to chase something or just to chase 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.590
 but for filigree work to 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.350
 carve or so is rather unsuitable yes 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.080
 is the knife in good condition 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.820
 chic knife that you can not now 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.500
 really should use a lot and that 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.320
 It should not get wet or fall 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.240
 fall down 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:03.050
 As I said it looks cool and so ins 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:06.460
 Does not cost much if it is you 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.060
 I like you because I do not know 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.760
 Of course I would like one over 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.350
 I'm looking forward to rating the video 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:18.230

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.670
 ask and yes subscribe for more me 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.709
 I also want more on the first test in 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.360
 above all, the future really wants it all 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.310
 good and there are many cheap mesz 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.510
 on Amazon 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.910
 if you buy left over my Amazon 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.650
 namely supported financially without more 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.360
 I can pay more products 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.670
