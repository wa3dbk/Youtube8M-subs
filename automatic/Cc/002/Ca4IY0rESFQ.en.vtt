00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.800
 as long as welcome to one 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.600
 set up short domination gameplay 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.630
 I arrived later 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.330
 do not know the score 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.279
 the opponents hold 22 we had zero like 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.900
 have developed the types sap ag drives 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.430
 So scooped probably even the whole 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.290
 although it was not actually 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.129
 Although she is in charge of sports 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.410
 is already clear 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.510
 well i came or put 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.040
 suspect that at least seven or 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.670
 Six man team was that was on everyone 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.110
 pretty funny yes I'm just one 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.059
 come and have you norwegen jubt 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.559
 right at the first attempt has pretty much 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.960
 horny and then in the end they could too 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.460
 still the skimpy but it's okay today 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.870
 Germans know that I am 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.220
 some comments gets at one 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.260
 Rotor comments that stop me over 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.250
 So I became so unnecessarily excitable 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.780
 now for example play with and will 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.640
 killed by the ump and I got myself 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.560
 about what a pilot said 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.510
 I then I already had times 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.190
 I shut myself up against myself 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.020
 do not play unnecessarily I know that 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.460
 also that some of you are on 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.530
 I also need to understand the sakhir 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.480
 I say but I am just like that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.310
 i play my subscribers really often 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.170
 to come to terms with that 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.820
 do as synonymous the action video now 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.430
 because I have no problems with that 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.110
 to admit that sometimes have to 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.610
 the operators or the like is just 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.390
 I'm so sorry I 'll 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.730
 maybe try a bit 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.650
 but restrict it by and large 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.720
 it will stay if it was not you out 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.100
 I'm so sorry then you can 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.880
 you watch old videos or something 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.850
 no idea 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.100
 well then i have some news 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.440
 I think 20 pieces wanders that 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.120
 hacked so much on the xbox right now 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.470
 I know I have now 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.400

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.600
 I did not play yesterday 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.810

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.160

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.370
 to play famous mw2 if that is now 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.570
 that's how hard they were 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.300

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.620

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.740
 but has imposed then I know 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.660
 not how I should do it 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.980
 then it will probably break off but me 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.840
 hope that it is not as blatant as on 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.030

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.610
