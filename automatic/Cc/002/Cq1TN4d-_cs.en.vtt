 special hologram which 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.180

 cardboard and put off packing now 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.390

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.170

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.409
 details in this case so case 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.140
 book front side is pressed 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.560
 leather textured leather with texture 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.509
 skin with what elements are on this 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.460
 front cover 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 Naturally a hole for a spoken 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.619
 speaker who else in the closed state you 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.650
 can take a call and talk 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.409
 by phone embossing on top 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.150
 lenovo stamping and bottom 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.680
 metal stamping 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.159
 vfx models look pretty stylish 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.920
 now the back side the back side is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:47.939
 Here is such a symbiosis of plastic and again 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.079
 same leather textured leather with holes well 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.619
 Naturally Lenovo logo 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:58.229
 so in general plastic is plastic 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.259
 has constructive elements this 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.500
 control volume rocker 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.740
 there is an unlock on button 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.679
 the screen is naturally a hole under three with 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.430
 half from above and below 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.540
 naturally 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.260
 microusb and microphone holes are all 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.409
 all holes perfectly match all 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.019
 wonderful 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.239
 inside inside but again how would it 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.170
 plastic and this leather 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.060
 the base where the phone is inserted in general 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.430
 how it is inserted enough 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.000
 easy to snap now front 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.989
 the lid on the inside is soft 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.709
 microfiber fabric 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.939
 along the contour we see this 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.010
 Silicone is so small 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:50.609
 sizing is necessary so that when 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.530
 you close the cover and front cover 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.109
 fits the screen so it just 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.689
 he did not slip that is, he is so secure 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.489
 fixed and due to silicone it 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:04.859
 so it will not slide on the screen 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.829
 once again this soft fabric 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.810
 microfiber means fixing points everything 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.500
 sometimes they ask at all how much he 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.220
 well arched ie there is a soft 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.470
 leather case is pretty easy running out 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.010
 curved 360 degrees 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.780
 but as 180 and 360 but again 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.280
 I want to remind that there is a hole under 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.979
 the speaker that is possible 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.180
 talk and closed in 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:35.010
 This case has such features 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.010
 in addition one more feature is necessary 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.840
 do not forget that the function works 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.780
 smart case that is, this case is equipped 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.819
 so in the front cover is small 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.159
 a magnet that allows for opening 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.560
 case automatically unlock screen 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.859
 phone and, respectively, when the case 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.189
 closes the screen turns off the phones 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.739
 there is such a duty mode 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.259
 It means again the gray cover and again 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.729
 beige case 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:06.169
 show in the frame what is distinctive 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:09.840
 gray cover features 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:14.370
 It means a gray case 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.430
 beige leather from the back side of the same 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.669
 the very elements that is stamping lenovo 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.770
 Naturally all openings front 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.580
 side is the same 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.520
 embossed in bags and inside then 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.560
 there is again a beige plastic gray 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.710
 from the inside 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.270
 soft skin is the same here 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.280
 the design is the same as the material 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.379
 that is, it is a microfiber which is soft 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.539
 the fabric is attached to the tap again 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.129
 silicone circuit that does not give 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.919
 slide the covers on the screen 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.259
 but all the same design elements 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.169
 again the screen unlock sensor 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:55.349
 everything works the same way as the version 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.919
 gray well, naturally as it were in 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:01.680
 orange even the most functionality 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.590
 Here is such a review 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.280
 each case we give a protective film in 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.669
