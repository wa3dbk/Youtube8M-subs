00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:07.330
 good thing is that yes I know I was by 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.490
 here although it seems like a lie 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.620
 well, I say 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.240
 ending is on youtube seen the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.019
 date the last video I say this can not 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.920
 be 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.140
 we have to upload some videos here 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.790
 to these kids because if they do not go to 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.340
 bored of many things but good that 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.869
 what I said, yes, I saw what I was doing 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.180
 enough time did not go up so for 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.629
 twitter in your game some more photos and 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.489
 that but, well, I admit that I'm a 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.130
 little abandoned I say let's see from the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.100
 what do I have here 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.910
 we take one, we record it and upload it 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.490
 to cowboys so you can see it and good 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.650
 the other good thing you are already seeing are some 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.880
 designs with more or less you know this is 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.600
 a classic is already worth 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.530
 These zombies can be put on 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.430
 background things that we like the typical 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 scratched that too 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.170
 as I say a classic fish 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.640
 we got splitter we already did 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.150
 and well we know we have learned to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.340
 do it with the help of a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.020
 of the little things that we have incorporated into 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.649
 our size 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.649
 and well, here you have 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.480
 red but 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.590
 background has that would be something that 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.480
 can even make a clan a place 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.810
 has been decided on a plan that you have the 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.810
 same 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.159
 we are specialists you can 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.420
 do 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:59.960
 and not 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.830
 tell you that if you do not see me around here and 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.820
 we are on twitter 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.970
 and by ebay if you bought something 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.470
 directly to the mail in the description 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:19.480

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.099
 we get the next one 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.099

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.459
