Iris<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.780> however<00:01:04.470> need<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.220> pruned

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
Iris they do however need to be pruned

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
Iris they do however need to be pruned
and<00:01:06.270> divided<00:01:06.869> every<00:01:07.439> couple<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> years

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and divided every couple of years

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.039 
and divided every couple of years
because<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> let<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.240> grow<00:01:09.479> into<00:01:09.720> very

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
because if you let them grow into very

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.160 
because if you let them grow into very
large<00:01:10.820> crowded<00:01:11.820> clumps<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.960> won't

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
large crowded clumps they just won't

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.100 
large crowded clumps they just won't
bloom<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.610> every<00:01:15.540> couple<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> years

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
bloom as well so every couple of years

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
bloom as well so every couple of years
you'll<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.820> most

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you'll want to do that and with most

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.780 
you'll want to do that and with most
perennials<00:01:19.020> you'll<00:01:19.290> want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> divide<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.640> do

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
perennials you'll want to divide and do

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.050 
perennials you'll want to divide and do
your<00:01:21.799> work<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> season

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
your work with them in the season

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
your work with them in the season
opposite<00:01:24.600> their<00:01:24.750> blooms<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.320> since<00:01:25.530> they

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
opposite their blooms so since they

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
opposite their blooms so since they
bloom<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.100> spring<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.240> early

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
bloom in the spring we do that in early

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
bloom in the spring we do that in early
fall<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.140> gives<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> chance<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
fall and that gives them a chance to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
fall and that gives them a chance to
adjust<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.060> grow<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> put<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.200> new<00:01:31.409> roots<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
adjust and grow and put on new roots and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
adjust and grow and put on new roots and
set<00:01:32.070> blooms<00:01:32.340> again<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> following

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
set blooms again for the following

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
set blooms again for the following
spring<00:01:33.900> plus<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.829> easier<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> gardener

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
spring plus it's easier on the gardener

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
spring plus it's easier on the gardener
it's<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.299> cooler<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> hope<00:01:37.200> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it's a little bit cooler we hope so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
it's a little bit cooler we hope so
you'll<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> spading<00:01:39.540> fork<00:01:39.720> and

you'll want to take a spading fork and
go<00:01:40.530> around<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.280> clump<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:41.909> gently<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.860> just

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
go around the clump very gently and just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310 
go around the clump very gently and just
lift<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.729> loosen<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:46.049> once

lift them and loosen them and then once

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
lift them and loosen them and then once
you<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.590> those<00:01:46.799> clumps<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.399> set<00:01:48.090> them<00:01:48.240> aside

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360

lilies<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.790> well<00:02:02.969> so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
lilies to get going and do well so

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
lilies to get going and do well so
you'll<00:02:04.200> end<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.619> with<00:02:04.680> rhizomes<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.670> look

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you'll end up with rhizomes that look

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660 
you'll end up with rhizomes that look
like<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.829> rhizome<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> has

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
like this and the rhizome that has

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.210 
like this and the rhizome that has

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
to bloom again and you'll know those

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
to bloom again and you'll know those
because<00:02:13.349> they're<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.709> one

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
because they're the one

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.790 
because they're the one
that<00:02:14.220> look<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.880> old<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:16.020> leathery<00:02:16.260> they

that look kind of old and leathery they

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.479 
that look kind of old and leathery they
may<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.040> kind<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> quirky<00:02:18.420> looking<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.160> those

may be kind of quirky looking and those

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.339 
may be kind of quirky looking and those
you'll<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:20.910> cut<00:02:21.209> away<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.660> discard<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.230> can

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
you'll just cut away and discard you can

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.470 
you'll just cut away and discard you can
put<00:02:22.530> those<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.920> compost<00:02:23.370> pile<00:02:23.610> do<00:02:24.209> look

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
put those in the compost pile do look

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.260 
put those in the compost pile do look
for<00:02:24.840> iris<00:02:25.440> rhizomes<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.310> are<00:02:26.430> kind<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.849> soft

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
for iris rhizomes that are kind of soft

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.160 
for iris rhizomes that are kind of soft
because<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.530> may<00:02:28.739> indicate<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:30.170> bacterial

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
because that may indicate a bacterial

because that may indicate a bacterial
disease<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.580> holes<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.239> them

disease and if they have holes in them

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.000 
disease and if they have holes in them
that<00:02:33.660> look<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:33.989> borer<00:02:34.319> holes<00:02:34.739> you'll

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
that look like borer holes you'll

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.059 
that look like borer holes you'll
definitely<00:02:35.520> want<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.819> discard<00:02:36.360> those<00:02:36.890> not<00:02:37.890> in

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
definitely want to discard those not in

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.880 
definitely want to discard those not in

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the compost in the trash but just cut

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.710 
the compost in the trash but just cut
off<00:02:41.160> any<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.930> new<00:02:43.940> shoots<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.420> the

off any of the the new shoots of the the
rhizomes<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.650> those<00:02:46.920> will<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.400> ones<00:02:47.580> that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
rhizomes and those will be the ones that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.210 
rhizomes and those will be the ones that
you<00:02:48.000> plant<00:02:48.300> again<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.440> take<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> sharp

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
you plant again so just take a sharp

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
you plant again so just take a sharp
pair<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.580> shears<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.540> cut<00:02:52.850> those<00:02:53.850> away<00:02:54.480> and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
pair of shears and cut those away and

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.520 
pair of shears and cut those away and
again<00:02:55.049> discard<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.920> old<00:02:56.280> part<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.319> if<00:02:58.319> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
again discard this old part and if you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
again discard this old part and if you
have<00:02:58.769> any<00:02:58.920> roots<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.489> are<00:02:59.580> torn<00:02:59.910> or<00:03:00.239> ragged

have any roots that are torn or ragged
or<00:03:01.049> shriveled<00:03:01.590> you'll<00:03:01.920> want<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.370> cut<00:03:02.880> those

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
or shriveled you'll want to cut those

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.150 
or shriveled you'll want to cut those
away<00:03:03.420> now<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.989> do<00:03:04.230> want<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.470> keep<00:03:04.620> these<00:03:04.830> moist

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
away now you do want to keep these moist

away now you do want to keep these moist
until<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.700> get<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> chance<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.420> get<00:03:06.569> them<00:03:06.750> in

until you get a chance to get them in

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.000 
until you get a chance to get them in
the<00:03:06.989> soil<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.280> cover<00:03:09.180> these<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.480> with<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.080> wet

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the soil so do cover these up with a wet

sheet put them in the shade as you're

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.070 
sheet put them in the shade as you're
preparing<00:03:13.680> them<00:03:13.980> they<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:14.970> stay<00:03:15.360> out<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.660> the

preparing them they can stay out of the
soil<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.739> while<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:17.549> best<00:03:17.819> not<00:03:18.030> to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
soil for a while but it's best not to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
let them dry out completely because it's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.849 
let them dry out completely because it's
very<00:03:21.030> difficult<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.780> them<00:03:22.049> rehydrated

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
again if your if your roots do dry out

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.580 
again if your if your roots do dry out
just<00:03:25.500> soak<00:03:25.739> them<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.280> water<00:03:27.030> solution<00:03:27.590> just

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
just soak them in a water solution just

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.800 
just soak them in a water solution just
to<00:03:28.829> barely<00:03:29.340> cover<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.820> rhizome<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.570> water

need to store them or if you're shipping
them<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.980> someone<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.700> wrap<00:03:38.970> them<00:03:39.209> in

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
damp that way so when you cut these ends

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.069 
damp that way so when you cut these ends
of<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.280> rhizomes<00:03:47.820> one<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.600> things<00:03:48.810> that's

of the rhizomes one of the things that's

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.660 
of the rhizomes one of the things that's
great<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.560> do<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.250> take<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> little

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
great to do is just take a little

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.690 
great to do is just take a little

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
the dusting sulfur and that can help cut

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.640 
the dusting sulfur and that can help cut
down<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.670> fungal<00:03:57.150> problems<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.930> bacterial

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
down on fungal problems and bacterial

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.490 
down on fungal problems and bacterial
problems<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.760> rhizomes<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.660> keep<00:04:01.260> them

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
problems in the rhizomes and keep them

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.440 
problems in the rhizomes and keep them
nice<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.430> healthy

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
nice and healthy

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.770 
nice and healthy
so<00:04:04.079> you'll<00:04:04.440> cut<00:04:04.769> away<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.549> foliage<00:04:06.209> some<00:04:06.660> of

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
so you'll cut away the foliage some of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.020 
so you'll cut away the foliage some of
this<00:04:06.870> foliage<00:04:07.290> looks<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.680> little<00:04:07.950> brown<00:04:08.579> and

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
this foliage looks a little brown and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.090 
this foliage looks a little brown and
discolored<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.109> take<00:04:10.380> some<00:04:10.590> very<00:04:10.769> sharp

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
discolored so take some very sharp

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.039 
discolored so take some very sharp
scissors<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.209> like<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.540> cut<00:04:12.750> them<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:12.989> a

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
scissors and I like to cut them in a

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.099 
scissors and I like to cut them in a
chevron<00:04:13.410> so<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.489> upper<00:04:15.329> leaves<00:04:15.750> are

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
chevron so that the upper leaves are

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.680 
chevron so that the upper leaves are
more<00:04:16.590> pointed<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.459> then<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.120> want<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.419> plant

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
more pointed and then you want to plant

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.990 
more pointed and then you want to plant
them<00:04:18.989> not<00:04:19.530> terribly<00:04:20.130> deeply<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.789> think

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
them not terribly deeply that I think

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.279 
them not terribly deeply that I think
that's<00:04:21.180> one<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.570> main<00:04:21.750> reasons<00:04:22.200> people

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
that's one of the main reasons people

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.200 
that's one of the main reasons people
have<00:04:22.530> problems<00:04:23.130> with<00:04:23.190> their<00:04:23.430> irises<00:04:23.729> they<00:04:24.030> try

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
have problems with their irises they try

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.630 
have problems with their irises they try
to<00:04:24.270> plant<00:04:24.570> them<00:04:24.750> too<00:04:24.930> deeply<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.800> really<00:04:26.220> want

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
to plant them too deeply you really want

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.440 
to plant them too deeply you really want
this

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
this

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.020 
this
surface<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.860> rhizome<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.670> be<00:04:29.820> right

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
surface of the the rhizome to be right

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.390 
surface of the the rhizome to be right
at<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.210> surface<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.960> soil<00:04:31.230> so<00:04:31.920> you'll

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
at the surface of the soil so you'll

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.480 
at the surface of the soil so you'll
want<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.000> make<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.390> little<00:04:33.630> hill<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.490> press

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
want to make a little hill and press

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.850 
want to make a little hill and press
those<00:04:35.760> roots<00:04:36.150> into<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.900> side<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.710> you'll

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
those roots into the side and you'll

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.640 
those roots into the side and you'll
pull<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.310> soil<00:04:38.640> up<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.120> really<00:04:39.750> compact<00:04:40.440> it

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
pull the soil up and really compact it

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.040 
pull the soil up and really compact it
around<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:41.040> soil<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.670> I<00:04:41.940> like<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.360> line<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
around the soil and I like to line the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.160 
around the soil and I like to line the
rises<00:04:43.590> up<00:04:44.010> in<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.640> same<00:04:44.940> direction<00:04:45.390> but<00:04:45.720> plant

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
rises up in the same direction but plant

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.780 
rises up in the same direction but plant
them<00:04:46.410> in<00:04:46.530> little<00:04:46.650> triangles<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.550> same

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
them in little triangles of the same

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.600 
them in little triangles of the same
color<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.750> can<00:04:48.930> see<00:04:49.200> here<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.770> rhizome

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
color and you can see here that rhizome

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.760 
color and you can see here that rhizome
is<00:04:50.790> is<00:04:51.060> really<00:04:51.450> showing<00:04:51.780> at<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.230> surface<00:04:52.620> of

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
is is really showing at the surface of

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.010 
is is really showing at the surface of
the<00:04:52.860> soil<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.610> don't<00:04:53.790> mulch<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.480> iris<00:04:54.840> they

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
the soil and I don't mulch the iris they

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.440 
the soil and I don't mulch the iris they
just<00:04:55.230> don't<00:04:55.440> need<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.710> lot<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.130> mulch<00:04:56.670> but<00:04:57.330> if

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
just don't need a lot of mulch but if

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.210 
just don't need a lot of mulch but if
you<00:04:57.540> plant<00:04:57.870> them<00:04:57.990> properly<00:04:58.470> divide<00:04:58.950> them

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
you plant them properly divide them

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.530 
you plant them properly divide them
occasionally<00:04:59.520> share<00:05:00.090> them<00:05:00.270> with<00:05:00.300> your

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
occasionally share them with your

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.770 
occasionally share them with your
friends<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:01.320> will<00:05:01.470> have<00:05:01.740> displays<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.850> color

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
friends you will have displays of color

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.350 
friends you will have displays of color
that<00:05:04.050> are<00:05:04.200> just<00:05:04.500> really<00:05:05.280> show-stopping

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
that are just really show-stopping

so do give all of the beautiful colors

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.860 
so do give all of the beautiful colors
of<00:05:10.260> iris<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.830> try<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:12.090> will<00:05:12.120> have<00:05:12.480> an<00:05:12.780> a

of iris a try and you will have an a

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.510 
of iris a try and you will have an a
