little fitted this is actually a purple
shocker<00:00:31.260> though<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.859> looks<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.160> bit<00:00:32.189> blown<00:00:32.579> on

video<00:00:33.590> turn<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.710> off<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.950> KX<00:00:35.430> 60<00:00:36.620> quite<00:00:37.620> an<00:00:37.739> odd

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
video turn this off a KX 60 quite an odd

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.299 
video turn this off a KX 60 quite an odd
one<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.190> late<00:00:38.610> 80s<00:00:39.090> early<00:00:39.360> 90s

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
one I think late 80s early 90s

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
one I think late 80s early 90s
I've<00:00:41.309> got<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> Phoebe<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.809> car

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I've got a Phoebe you can see this car

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
I've got a Phoebe you can see this car
sucky<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:53.360> it's<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.660> bit<00:00:54.780> longer

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
sucky on in and it's a little bit longer

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.049 
sucky on in and it's a little bit longer
than<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> old<00:00:55.410> shock<00:00:56.000> by<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.410> there

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
than the old shock by about from there

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
than the old shock by about from there
to<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:00.239> that's<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> distance<00:01:01.910> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to there that's about the distance it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.580 
to there that's about the distance it's
also<00:01:03.120> narrower<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> I've<00:01:04.949> had<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.339> washers

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
also narrower so I've had to use washers

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.630 
also narrower so I've had to use washers
as<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:09.890> because<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.130> narrower

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
as you can see because that's narrower

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.010 
as you can see because that's narrower
end<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.640> do<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.970> washes<00:01:15.270> trying<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> pace

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
end so I do some washes trying to pace

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.240 
end so I do some washes trying to pace
it<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.619> other<00:01:22.680> end<00:01:23.009> down<00:01:23.189> here

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it out of it and the other end down here

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.210 
it out of it and the other end down here
is<00:01:23.729> obviously<00:01:23.880> wider<00:01:24.650> but<00:01:25.650> luckily<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
is obviously wider but luckily it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
is obviously wider but luckily it
doesn't<00:01:26.549> move<00:01:26.670> too<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
doesn't move too much it's actually just

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
doesn't move too much it's actually just
the<00:01:28.020> book<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.470> little<00:01:28.619> teeth<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:30.119> can

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
preload but it's only slightly you can

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.550 
preload but it's only slightly you can
adjust<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.329> very<00:01:39.329> much<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.780> sorry<00:01:40.290> sell

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
got quite a few different to low

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.469 
got quite a few different to low
settings<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.820> ring<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
screw up does set a maximum which is a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
screw up does set a maximum which is a
lot<00:01:49.200> better<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.439> take<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.860> weight<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.659> still

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
lot better to take my weight but still

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
lot better to take my weight but still
is<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:52.020> soft<00:01:52.470> compared<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.280> other

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is with soft compared to some other

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
is with soft compared to some other
Springs<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.909> saw<00:01:54.090> someone<00:01:54.450> has<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.470> for

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
Springs I saw someone has one for

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
Springs I saw someone has one for
saleable<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> white<00:01:56.640> spring<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.420> don't

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
saleable like a white spring I don't

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
saleable like a white spring I don't
know<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> different<00:01:58.259> weights<00:01:58.439> are<00:01:58.729> now

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
know what the different weights are now

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
know what the different weights are now
this<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.119> seems<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.570> more<00:02:00.840> travel<00:02:01.290> take

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this one seems to have more travel take

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.249 
this one seems to have more travel take
the<00:02:01.710> weight<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> bit<00:02:02.159> better<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.259> know

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the weight a bit better and you know

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.899 
the weight a bit better and you know
it's<00:02:04.619> slightly<00:02:04.890> longer<00:02:05.159> slapping<00:02:05.610> ease<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
it's slightly longer slapping ease the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850 
it's slightly longer slapping ease the
swing<00:02:06.420> arm<00:02:06.570> sits<00:02:06.869> bit<00:02:07.079> further<00:02:07.320> down<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
swing arm sits bit further down which is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720 
swing arm sits bit further down which is
always<00:02:08.069> handy<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.550> start<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> yeah<00:02:11.520> it's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
always handy to start with so yeah it's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.830 
always handy to start with so yeah it's
a<00:02:11.930> mica<00:02:12.930> end<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.410> spring

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
a mica end of a spring

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.330 
a mica end of a spring
for<00:02:13.959> in<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> future<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.680> farm<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.069> part

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
for in the future for farm one part

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.710 
for in the future for farm one part
because<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.940> can't<00:02:16.150> really<00:02:16.300> get<00:02:16.420> any<00:02:16.569> for<00:02:16.690> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
because you can't really get any for the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.660 
because you can't really get any for the
people<00:02:17.170> each<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.319> these<00:02:17.500> KXAS<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.310> even<00:02:18.489> old

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
people each of these KXAS and even old

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.800
