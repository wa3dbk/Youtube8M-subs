00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
cars.com auto review  I'm Mike Hanley
cars.com Volkswagens aiming to become a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.469
bigger player in the US market in the
redesign 2011 general represents a key

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.150
component in that strategy

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.900
it also represents something of a
philosophy ship for this car because the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.350
redesigned model has lost some of the
premium attributes that define the car

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.710
in the past but it's getting more
backseat room and retain the cars

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.320
noteworthy handling performance the
redesign jenna gets all new styling and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
it's a bigger car to its 3.5 inches
longer overall it has a more creased

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.300
angular look to it sheetmetal you can
really see the design language in this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.489
new grill which emphasizes the cars with
nice wide horizontal around back the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.500
taillight influences you can definitely
see come from Audi one of the ways

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.949
volkswagen hopes the new Jenna will
appeal to buyers by offering a new low

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.489
cost model that starts around fifteen
thousand dollars that's not the model

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.780
here this is a 2.5 SEL that's a
mid-range sedan but you can see that the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.439
cost-cutting that's gone into making
that low cost model has been applied

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.040
across the range because some of the
soft-touch materials from the old car

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.140
now hard plastic the height adjustable
arm rest is just a fixed height 1 some

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.650
of the manual air conditioning controls
feel little rickety and overall finish

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.070
isn't as high as it used to be now if
you're coming from a honda civic or

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.820
toyota corolla the interior still look
pretty nice but if you're familiar with

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.700
old Volkswagens and what they've done in
the past

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
this might seem a little low grade to
the agenda has a clear advantage over

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.350
its competition is in its rear seat the
new cars longer wheelbase results in

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
more backseat legroom whenever I send a
car like the honda civic quarter Crolla

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.720
my knees are pressed against the rear of
the front seats but not in this car i

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
have about two inches of legroom despair
and I'm about 6 feet 1 inches tall so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.750
when you combine that with the large
15.5 cubic for trunk that this car has

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.280
there's definitely enough room to carry
for adults and other things even though

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.670
the new doesn't feel as upscale on the
inside volkswagen has retained the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.939
sporty driving experience this car is
known for it feels solid and planted

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.630
when cornering with limited body roll
and still pretty firm writing car you

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.790
definitely get a sense

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.500
the road when driving the base engines
of 115 horsepower 2-liter 4-cylinder

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.670
engine but our cars equipped with the
volume motor and that's a 170 horsepower

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.500
2.5 liter inline five-cylinder engine
and despite its odd cylinder cart it's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.620
pretty smooth revving motor now that
anything contained with either a

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.280
five-speed manual or 6-speed automatic
the automatic has a little problem with

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.510
throttle lag right from a standing stop
in the five speeds power delivery isn't

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.740
the most linear but overall this is a
pretty strong engine for this class the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.700
generous by far Volkswagens best-selling
model in the US but the changes they

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.260
made for the 2011 model year they made
it less likely to appeal to certain core

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.420
VW buyers who appreciate driving fun and
upscale interior amenities in not being

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.750
able to hang its hat on reliability the
way honda and toyota can that's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.750
something of a risk
