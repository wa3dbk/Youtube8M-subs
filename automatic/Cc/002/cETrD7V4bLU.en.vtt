00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.279 
anyways so coming up to a vertical rope
the<00:00:25.340> what<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.570> would<00:00:27.960> say<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the what I do and I would say this is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.019 
the what I do and I would say this is
the<00:00:28.349> preferred<00:00:28.680> method<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:29.099> jump<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.670> high<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the preferred method I jump as high as I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.120 
the preferred method I jump as high as I
can<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.420> grab<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.779> high<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.529> then<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
can and grab as high as I can and then I

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.160 
can and grab as high as I can and then I
work<00:00:32.430> my<00:00:32.640> leg<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.600> when<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> mean<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
work my leg in and when I mean but I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.069 
work my leg in and when I mean but I
when<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.530> worked<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:34.890> leg<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.660> broke<00:00:36.660> between<00:00:36.989> my

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
when I worked my leg in broke between my

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.069 
when I worked my leg in broke between my
legs<00:00:37.940> swing<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.260> around<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> then<00:00:42.079> around

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
legs swing one around and then around

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.680 
legs swing one around and then around
again<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> got<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.940> coiled<00:00:45.329> around<00:00:45.420> your

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
again so you got it coiled around your

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.830 
again so you got it coiled around your
leg<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.410> take<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.950> boot<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.390> bite<00:00:48.660> it

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
leg you take this boot and you bite it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.459 
leg you take this boot and you bite it
and<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.160> give<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> break<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and this will give you a break so you

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.850 
and this will give you a break so you
don't<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.160> down<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.680> you
