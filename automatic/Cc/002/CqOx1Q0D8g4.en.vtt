00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:06.030
 at the end of this video we will be able to put on fabric tools 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.790
 minimal for him 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.110
 that is included in the program smap your stretches and according to our 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.730
 convenience to achieve the displacement of the map 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.989
 without having to be changing 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.439
 the tool that we are using 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.269
 in the example we start from the fact that we have on the map 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.279
 three points 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.710
 captured 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.880
 with our 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 manually created oui gps 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.020
 to work in sending polis 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540
 to report 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.110
 our scale should be 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.060
 in its min value 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 to achieve maximum precision 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.560
 so 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.830
 what do we do the corresponding adjustment in the letter 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020
 what is 20 meters 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.960
 this greater approach where we achieve the three points because we prefer 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.420
 Move around the map to see your relationship 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.170
 finally we can be using navarro 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.700
 vertical that we have on the right 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.410
 with the horizontal bar that we have in the bottom 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.900
 however, we are using 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 the button on the huecco toolbar 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300
 i wanted to change tools by hand 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.640
 for this we are going to use 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.120
 in the United Kingdom 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.730
 of tools see 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.650
 show minimum peace 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.660
 and it does not appear 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.960
 program on the right 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.920
 square 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.620
 which is called minimum 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.890
 we are still using the pont web tool 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.740
 we see as such pulsar with the left button and drag within the minimum 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.260
 image compacts 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.020
 displacement occurs on the map we are observing 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.960
 I say that this tool will allow us to travel 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.120
 type of hand tool 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.590
 within a minimum part c will be reflected in a map that we are 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.980
 developing to send 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.980
 the reports of the points that we have captured 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.379
 this mini map which very clear where it suits us best can be the right 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.749
 city 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.759
 or it can be on the left side 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:21.229
 holding a left mouse button on the bar 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.929
 higher 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.029
 we can not move anywhere on the map 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.059
 but always inside the square where the deadline is shown 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.359
 you can not leave that point 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.609
 swisher down to the left to the right 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.980
 or the car on the right hand rich the coverage of the minimap on plane not 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.369
 we can expand a bit if we go to the configuration of it that is 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.879
 find efe 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.269
 preferences we remember in the menu to avoid 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.839
 preferences 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.529
 and in the tab 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:55.939
 screen 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.479
 we get the size of my map 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.149
 at this moment is 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:03.419
 but we can change the greatness 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.949
 to change the big 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.159
 we have to give it to apply because they are fulfilled we see how 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.549
 the coverage on planes is extinguished mind 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.049
 the most strange 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.019
 and any displacement we will have more coverage on plane that we are 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.449
 working 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.889
 i do it displacement 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.339
 in any direction division without changing the tool bar 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.339
 we are looking for the overturn 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.919
 thus 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.219
 we can make short trips 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.639
 why sense 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:37.699
 with this 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.319
 tool that was called minimal because we can defer the plane up 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.639
 with a slight movement 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.889
 of course this is not all the comfort that I do not have 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.129
 what to be doing 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.049
 moving the pointer to the vertical bar with the horizontal bar for 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.139
 be small displacements 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.400
 This is another presentation of the gps group and carry 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.209
 from Venezuela
