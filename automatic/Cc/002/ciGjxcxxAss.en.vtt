Alvarez is the biggest strongest guy to
Mayweather's<00:00:14.130> fun<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.420> trick

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.580 

go<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> body<00:00:20.850> effectively<00:00:21.630> against<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
go to the body effectively against a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.040 
go to the body effectively against a
weather<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.910> he<00:00:24.180> hurt<00:00:24.420> him<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> body

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
weather and can he hurt him to the body

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.530 
weather and can he hurt him to the body
if<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> think<00:00:26.520> he<00:00:26.580> has<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.700> genuine<00:00:27.150> shot

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
if you can I think he has a genuine shot

in<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.779> fight<00:00:28.020> but<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
in this fight but I think it's going to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.499 
in this fight but I think it's going to
be<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:28.770> intriguing<00:00:29.310> fine<00:00:29.610> what<00:00:30.090> things<00:00:30.330> are

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
right hand and then I don't think he

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.260 
right hand and then I don't think he
should<00:00:59.510> trade<00:01:00.050> hooks<00:01:00.290> okay<00:01:01.250> well<00:01:01.880> I'm<00:01:01.970> a<00:01:02.120> way

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
should trade hooks okay well I'm a way

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.030 
should trade hooks okay well I'm a way
that<00:01:02.450> just<00:01:02.570> bought<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:02.870> few<00:01:03.140> months<00:01:03.440> ago<00:01:03.560> yeah

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
that just bought a few months ago yeah

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.590 
that just bought a few months ago yeah
so<00:01:04.280> he's<00:01:04.460> already<00:01:04.640> kind<00:01:05.090> of<00:01:05.150> in<00:01:05.300> better<00:01:05.480> shape

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
so he's already kind of in better shape

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.900 
so he's already kind of in better shape
than<00:01:06.080> previous<00:01:06.710> campaigns<00:01:07.190> should<00:01:07.640> there<00:01:07.790> be

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
than previous campaigns should there be

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.150 
than previous campaigns should there be
a<00:01:07.940> concern<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:08.420> he<00:01:08.930> doesn't<00:01:09.260> over<00:01:09.680> train<00:01:09.950> and

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.620 
a concern that he doesn't over train and
