some<00:00:29.670> veterans<00:00:30.030> now<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.420> had<00:00:30.600> a<00:00:30.860> back<00:00:31.860> market

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:32.339 
some veterans now we had a back market

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.310 
some veterans now we had a back market
because<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.269> case<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.750> pull<00:00:33.929> out<00:00:34.079> front

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
because in that case your pull out front

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.919 
because in that case your pull out front
of<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> fire<00:00:34.679> last<00:00:34.890> run<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.539> then<00:00:36.539> give<00:00:36.750> us<00:00:36.839> a

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929 
of a fire last run so then give us a

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:38.630
