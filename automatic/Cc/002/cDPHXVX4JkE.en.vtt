00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
so we call it we say that it's the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.480 
so we call it we say that it's the
presence<00:00:15.869> of<00:00:16.020> Jesus<00:00:16.410> among<00:00:17.070> his<00:00:17.250> people

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490

pursue his mission on this planet so in
a<00:00:23.070> sense<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.640> believe<00:00:24.059> all<00:00:24.419> churches<00:00:25.200> are

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
a sense I believe all churches are

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.130 
a sense I believe all churches are
organic<00:00:26.099> or<00:00:26.279> they're<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:26.910> church<00:00:27.180> if<00:00:27.960> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
organic or they're not the church if you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.799 
organic or they're not the church if you
look<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.559> New<00:00:28.680> Testament<00:00:29.279> there<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.809> many

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.800 
natural elements in fact the Bible
doesn't<00:00:40.920> really<00:00:41.340> define<00:00:41.670> church<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.570> just

living stones even every single brick is

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.050 
living stones even every single brick is
alive<00:00:59.700> so<00:01:00.630> it's<00:01:01.020> very<00:01:01.320> strongly<00:01:02.070> emphasizing

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
alive so it's very strongly emphasizing

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.090 
alive so it's very strongly emphasizing
in<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> New<00:01:03.390> Testament<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.110> church<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.070> a

without a vine firewood all of these
pictures<00:01:32.280> point<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.060> fact<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.389> the

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
pictures point to the fact that the

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.809 
pictures point to the fact that the
presence<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.380> Jesus<00:01:34.770> among<00:01:35.130> us<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.609> most

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
presence of Jesus among us is the most

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.239 
presence of Jesus among us is the most
important<00:01:36.420> part<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.109> we<00:01:37.319> are<00:01:37.350> however

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
important part of what we are however

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.510 
important part of what we are however
often<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.119> define<00:01:39.749> church<00:01:40.219> without<00:01:41.219> including

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
often we define church without including

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.719 
often we define church without including
Christ's<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.420> his<00:01:42.749> presence<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.319> the<00:01:43.439> core<00:01:43.729> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
Christ's and his presence is the core we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.910 
Christ's and his presence is the core we
assume<00:01:45.029> it<00:01:45.209> but<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.719> don't<00:01:45.869> actually<00:01:46.079> say<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
assume it but we don't actually say it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.699 
assume it but we don't actually say it
and<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.219> think<00:01:47.459> that's<00:01:47.609> a<00:01:47.700> mistake

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
and I think that's a mistake

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.399 
and I think that's a mistake
so<00:01:49.709> for<00:01:49.950> me<00:01:50.130> organic<00:01:51.060> church<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.569> spiritual

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
so for me organic church is a spiritual

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.160 
so for me organic church is a spiritual
family<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.889> mission<00:01:53.249> together<00:01:53.689> with<00:01:54.689> Christ

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
family on mission together with Christ

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.519 
family on mission together with Christ
on<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> inside<00:01:56.069> of<00:01:56.099> each<00:01:56.429> one<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.439> us

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:58.529 
on the inside of each one so for us

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:00.620 
on the inside of each one so for us
organic<00:01:59.279> church<00:01:59.490> isn't<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> model<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
organic church isn't about a model it's

organic church isn't about a model it's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
