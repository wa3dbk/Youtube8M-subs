00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
we're back and this is the scene on

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.710 
we're back and this is the scene on
court<00:00:02.760> 8<00:00:03.859> that's<00:00:04.859> Favara<00:00:05.370> Lepchenko<00:00:05.720> being

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
court 8 that's Favara Lepchenko being

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.749 
court 8 that's Favara Lepchenko being
treated<00:00:07.140> for<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> heat<00:00:11.480> laying<00:00:12.480> down<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.759> in

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
treated for the heat laying down and in

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
treated for the heat laying down and in
the<00:00:14.940> shade<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.839> again<00:00:16.320> offers<00:00:16.949> very

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the shade but that again offers very

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.990 
the shade but that again offers very
little<00:00:17.310> relief<00:00:21.920> heat<00:00:22.920> rule<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.490> effect<00:00:23.580> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
little relief heat rule is in effect I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.340 
little relief heat rule is in effect I
think<00:00:24.029> they're<00:00:24.330> talking<00:00:24.689> about<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
think they're talking about there and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.589 
think they're talking about there and
they're<00:00:25.830> allowed<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> 10-minute

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
they're allowed to take a 10-minute

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.269 
they're allowed to take a 10-minute
break<00:00:27.630> between<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> second<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.710> third<00:00:28.830> sets

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
break between the second and third sets

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.120 
break between the second and third sets
but<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.869> little<00:00:31.019> more<00:00:31.140> serious<00:00:31.529> than<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
but it's a little more serious than that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.150 
but it's a little more serious than that
for<00:00:32.369> Lepchenko<00:00:33.329> she<00:00:33.809> won<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.530> set<00:00:34.710> 6-4

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
for Lepchenko she won the first set 6-4

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060 
for Lepchenko she won the first set 6-4
this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.120> downright<00:00:36.329> dangerous<00:00:36.770> yeah<00:00:37.770> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
this is just downright dangerous yeah I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.500 
this is just downright dangerous yeah I
don't<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> tournament<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
don't know what the tournament is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
don't know what the tournament is
thinking<00:00:39.930> how<00:00:40.110> hard<00:00:40.379> does<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.680> need<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> be

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
thinking how hard does it need to be

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310 
thinking how hard does it need to be
does<00:00:41.790> somebody<00:00:41.969> need<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> actually<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:43.020> die

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
does somebody need to actually like die

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
does somebody need to actually like die
before<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.190> say<00:00:44.370> oh<00:00:44.550> maybe<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.180> should<00:00:45.360> cause

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
before they say oh maybe we should cause

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
before they say oh maybe we should cause
the<00:00:45.539> roof<00:00:45.840> maybe<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.800> should<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.219> putting

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
the roof maybe we should not be putting

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.959 
the roof maybe we should not be putting
matches<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> outside<00:00:48.629> courts<00:00:49.789> no<00:00:50.789> matter

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
matches on the outside courts no matter

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.549 
matches on the outside courts no matter
how<00:00:51.210> great<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.719> shape<00:00:52.079> you're<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
how great a shape you're in

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
how great a shape you're in
eventually<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.610> heat<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
eventually the heat will get you and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.020 
eventually the heat will get you and
it's<00:00:55.320> becoming<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.920> dangerous<00:00:56.280> situation<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it's becoming a dangerous situation to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.660 
it's becoming a dangerous situation to
me<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.440> should<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> story<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
me and should not be the story of the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.889 
me and should not be the story of the
tournament<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.090> heat<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> other

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
tournament the heat and the other

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.100 
tournament the heat and the other
players<00:01:01.140> cope<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.460> fair

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.450 

they<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.259> get<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> 10-minute<00:01:10.860> break<00:01:11.100> between

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
they will get a 10-minute break between

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
they will get a 10-minute break between
sets<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:14.450> physician<00:01:15.450> asking<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
sets and so the physician asking the the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.109 
sets and so the physician asking the the
trainer<00:01:16.860> asking<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.399> they<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
trainer asking if they can go all the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
trainer asking if they can go all the
way<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.509> locker<00:01:18.689> room<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.110> they<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> cool

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
way to the locker room so they can cool

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
way to the locker room so they can cool
down<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.369> about<00:01:20.579> keeping<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:21.090> core

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
down it's all about keeping the core

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.419 
down it's all about keeping the core
body<00:01:21.689> temperature<00:01:22.320> low<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.770> long<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.159> possible

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.160 

okay<00:01:26.429> we've<00:01:27.000> been<00:01:27.030> talking<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.990> air

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
okay we've been talking about the air

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.959 
okay we've been talking about the air
temperature<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.729> 110<00:01:30.630> degrees<00:01:30.710> that's

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
temperature at 110 degrees that's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.539 
temperature at 110 degrees that's
magnified<00:01:32.969> on<00:01:33.509> court<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.649> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
magnified on court because the the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.160 
magnified on court because the the
surface<00:01:35.850> even<00:01:36.329> though<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.569> is<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.899> better

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
surface even though this is a better

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
surface even though this is a better
service<00:01:37.649> than<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.920> used<00:01:38.069> to<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.420> retains<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
service than it used to be retains the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.420 
service than it used to be retains the
heat<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:40.640> amplifies

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.510 

so<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.549> on-court<00:01:46.240> temperature<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.950> suspect

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
so the on-court temperature we suspect

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.940 
so the on-court temperature we suspect
is<00:01:48.729> somewhere<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.270> neighborhood<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.720> 120

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.200 

chico<00:01:56.950> will<00:01:57.070> be<00:01:57.190> better<00:01:57.340> off<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.700> giving<00:01:58.060> up

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
chico will be better off just giving up

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.940 
chico will be better off just giving up
on<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.570> game<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.140> getting<00:01:59.470> into<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> locker

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
on that game and getting into the locker

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.770 
on that game and getting into the locker
room<00:02:00.220> as<00:02:00.340> quickly<00:02:00.520> as<00:02:00.850> possible<00:02:00.909> trying<00:02:01.630> to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
room as quickly as possible trying to

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.810 
room as quickly as possible trying to
get<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.110> core<00:02:02.890> temperature<00:02:03.369> down<00:02:03.520> and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
get the core temperature down and

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.370 
get the core temperature down and
hopefully<00:02:04.060> reset<00:02:04.720> for<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.020> third<00:02:05.259> set<00:02:05.560> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
hopefully reset for the third set a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.139 
hopefully reset for the third set a
situation<00:02:08.380> get<00:02:08.560> too<00:02:08.739> far<00:02:09.009> along<00:02:09.130> towards<00:02:09.940> the

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
situation get too far along towards the

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.760 
situation get too far along towards the
heat<00:02:10.420> stroke<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.989> it's<00:02:11.080> tough<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.470> turn<00:02:11.680> it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
heat stroke and it's tough to turn it

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.880 
heat stroke and it's tough to turn it
around<00:02:12.450> right<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:13.750> or<00:02:14.200> hit<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.500> serve<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
around right here or hit the serve and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.500 
around right here or hit the serve and
not<00:02:14.980> even<00:02:15.280> try<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> go<00:02:15.850> for<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.060> next<00:02:16.239> shot

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
not even try to go for the next shot

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.699 
not even try to go for the next shot
clear<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.050> set<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.350> over
