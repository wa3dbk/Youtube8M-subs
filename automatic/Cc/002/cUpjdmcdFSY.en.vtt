00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.890 
something had gotten big trouble for
when<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.800> was<00:00:10.920> younger<00:00:11.160> as<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.969> remember<00:00:12.389> it's

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
about this summer when I was about three

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.279 
about this summer when I was about three
or<00:00:14.460> four<00:00:14.670> years<00:00:14.820> old<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> my<00:00:15.360> mom<00:00:15.809> had<00:00:16.109> made

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
or four years old and my mom had made

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.960 
or four years old and my mom had made
those<00:00:16.560> little<00:00:16.890> pigs<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.400> blanket

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
those little pigs in a blanket

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.939 
those little pigs in a blanket
but<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> hot<00:00:18.600> dogs<00:00:18.810> coming<00:00:19.109> off<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> ends

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
but the hot dogs coming off at the ends

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.509 
but the hot dogs coming off at the ends
and<00:00:20.130> while<00:00:21.000> she<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.449> upstairs<00:00:21.900> doing<00:00:22.519> some

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
laundry letting them cool off I thought

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
laundry letting them cool off I thought
it<00:00:25.500> would<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> really<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.310> good<00:00:26.730> idea<00:00:27.000> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
picture of them and it would take the
