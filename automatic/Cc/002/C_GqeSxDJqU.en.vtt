approximately<00:02:01.930> eight<00:02:02.080> inches<00:02:02.560> when<00:02:02.770> they<00:02:02.890> fly

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
approximately eight inches when they fly

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.910 
approximately eight inches when they fly
supersonic<00:02:03.780> now<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.840> can't<00:02:05.260> see<00:02:05.470> anything

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
supersonic now you can't see anything

move unless you're in here if you look
at<00:02:09.070> that<00:02:09.190> photograph<00:02:09.490> there<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.200> see<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
at that photograph there you see the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.790 
at that photograph there you see the
flight<00:02:11.770> engineer<00:02:12.540> that's<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.810> at<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.500> end<00:02:14.650> of

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
flight engineer that's it at the end of

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.560 
flight engineer that's it at the end of
the<00:02:14.920> panel<00:02:15.130> there<00:02:15.459> yeah<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:16.180> see<00:02:16.330> where<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
the panel there yeah you see where the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.530 
the panel there yeah you see where the
blue<00:02:16.750> label<00:02:16.990> yeah<00:02:17.790> yeah<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.090> were<00:02:19.240> flying

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
blue label yeah yeah if we were flying

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.350 
blue label yeah yeah if we were flying
it<00:02:19.750> Matt<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:21.310> gap<00:02:21.550> there<00:02:21.790> about<00:02:22.090> an<00:02:22.180> inch

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
it Matt to be a gap there about an inch

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.630 
it Matt to be a gap there about an inch
you<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:23.590> enough<00:02:23.890> for<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.489> you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
you just enough for you to get you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.699 
you just enough for you to get you
handed<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.630> that's<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.959> only<00:02:26.230> place<00:02:26.470> you

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
handed and that's the only place you

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:35.280 
handed and that's the only place you
will<00:02:26.920> feasibly<00:02:27.370> see<00:02:27.670> expansion<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.959> what

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
will feasibly see expansion so what

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.810 
will feasibly see expansion so what
altitude<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.830> define<00:02:36.160> sixty<00:02:36.640> thousand<00:02:37.500> normal

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
altitude to define sixty thousand normal

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.580 
altitude to define sixty thousand normal
thirty-five<00:02:39.820> thousand<00:02:40.300> see<00:02:40.360> almost<00:02:40.600> 60s<00:02:41.440> what

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
thirty-five thousand see almost 60s what

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.410 
thirty-five thousand see almost 60s what
we<00:02:41.739> cruised<00:02:42.100> out<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.030> it's<00:02:43.180> always<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
we cruised out here so it's always a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.740 
we cruised out here so it's always a
very<00:02:43.660> smooth<00:02:43.989> flight<00:02:44.320> there's<00:02:44.739> no<00:02:44.920> weather

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750 

okay
