00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 I turned to you then because 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 I know a big one for me 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.259
 difficulty was with my pathetic 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 disease in public carriers 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.180
 for homeless or port dismissed 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.880
 a stay to find 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:35.250
 hepatitis c diagnosed since 1998 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.410
 accompanies me at the moment in the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.239
 treatment against hepatitis c because 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.450
 which has a lot of side effects 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.590
 the very violent side effects of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.750
 depression all the way to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 perception disorders and so on and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.130
 the monitoring is not a little 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.739
 bit talk to the doctor 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.110
 psychologists and so on lead that way 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 a bit together and give me there 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:06.420
 a great support and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.829
 Assistance at the beginning as itself 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 claassen have taken over two 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.070
 years, however, especially first time 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.009
 to arrive here and cause conflicts 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 to solve and even to understand 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.820
 as well as limitations are due 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 to accept this from diseases and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.400
 to see what to understand for now 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.020
 for him first to understand and to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.299
 accept what he does that it 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.530
 in fact, there are deep problems 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.869
 have to be edited around 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 get ahead 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 and then these are the goals he has 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.180
 somehow on realistic on the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 to put realistic ground around yourself 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.479
 not always a success 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.479
 to tinker yourself 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.159
 the stuff over the years now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.470
 in an imprisonment time before me 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.450
 came here 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.670
 slipping dare debt settlement 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.240
 a job a simple little one 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.070
 Employment that we build is like 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.750
 in a small group regularly the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.659
 week once binding the week 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.659
 after all to go so are such things 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.149
 simply as help position given here 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:17.890
 and you can call if you need 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:20.590
 That's a big thing if I am 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.200
 Again, I experience that on 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.610
 any case because it already has something if you 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.130
 with somebody together with us 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.500
 understands you well and not yours 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.870
 partner is where the crisis comes from 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.980
 if you have trend but that has 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.840
 the very different if such a 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.730
 friendship so to speak because 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.940
 forms diverges 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.620
 that will certainly be difficult already in the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.510
 year 2002 we have the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.760
 Batic also offers care 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.260
 people with chronic hepatitis 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.540
 open background is that too 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.430
 this group of people is looking for 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.549
 psychiatric illnesses affected 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.799
 is and the medical treatment of 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.290
 chronic hepatitis c for the 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.500
 very complicated very concerned 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.970
 is tedious and that these clients 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.489
 in this time very much 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.889
 need psychosocial support around 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.560
 ever get into the supply 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.700
 but also about the supply with ours 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.530
 get through help 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.870
 That's why we never have the decision 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.079
 Regret meanwhile are almost 40 percent 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.400
 all affected batic of hepatitis c 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.400
