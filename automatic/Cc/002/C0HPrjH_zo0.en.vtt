we're gonna add two hooks and then that

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.700 
we're gonna add two hooks and then that
way<00:00:25.700> we<00:00:25.880> can<00:00:26.029> put<00:00:26.210> a<00:00:26.240> value<00:00:26.480> on<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.050> send<00:00:27.590> it

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
way we can put a value on it and send it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:39.450 
way we can put a value on it and send it
down<00:00:27.860> to<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.130> bottom<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:28.730> that's<00:00:29.509> this<00:00:29.720> one

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.950 

typically<00:00:40.460> when<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:40.699> buy<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.879> jig<00:00:41.269> they're

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
typically when you buy a jig they're

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.240 
typically when you buy a jig they're
going<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.170> come<00:00:42.350> just<00:00:42.379> like<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:42.980> single<00:00:43.850> hook

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
going to come just like this single hook

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.710 
going to come just like this single hook
so<00:00:46.250> what<00:00:46.400> are<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:46.579> going<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.730> need<00:00:46.970> you're

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
so what are you going to need you're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:01:00.189 
so what are you going to need you're
going<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:47.900> need<00:00:50.949> two<00:00:51.949> hooks<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.960> first

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
going to need two hooks and the first

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.509 
going to need two hooks and the first
thing<00:01:00.350> you're<00:01:00.440> going<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:00.650> do<00:01:00.799> is<00:01:01.040> you're<00:01:01.489> going

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
thing you're going to do is you're going

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.670 
thing you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:01.640> find<00:01:01.909> a<00:01:01.970> hook<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.180> matches<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.260> exact

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
to find a hook that matches the exact

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.940 
to find a hook that matches the exact
same<00:01:03.949> size<00:01:04.630> so<00:01:05.630> basically<00:01:06.049> you're<00:01:06.770> going<00:01:06.860> to

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
same size so basically you're going to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.609 
same size so basically you're going to
put<00:01:07.100> them<00:01:07.159> side-by-side<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:08.500> you're<00:01:09.500> going

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
put them side-by-side and you're going

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.980 
put them side-by-side and you're going
to<00:01:09.650> make<00:01:09.799> sure<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.369> hook<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.659> exact

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
to make sure that the hook is the exact

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.010 
to make sure that the hook is the exact
same<00:01:12.229> size<00:01:12.880> that's<00:01:13.880> very<00:01:14.360> important<00:01:14.930> when

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
same size that's very important when

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.679 
same size that's very important when
doing<00:01:15.259> this<00:01:15.380> rig<00:01:16.240> next<00:01:17.240> we're<00:01:17.360> going<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.509> take

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
doing this rig next we're going to take

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.980 
doing this rig next we're going to take
pliers<00:01:18.049> if<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:18.650> have<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:18.860> pair<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.159> both<00:01:19.610> liars

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990

I'm going to run the plant right down
the<00:01:56.720> crease<00:01:59.170> basically<00:02:00.170> that'll<00:02:00.530> open<00:02:00.799> it

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
the crease basically that'll open it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.720 

then<00:02:05.950> what<00:02:06.100> your<00:02:06.220> going<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.370> do<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.610> you're

then what your going to do is you're

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.400 
then what your going to do is you're
going<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.880> get<00:02:07.000> your<00:02:07.180> second<00:02:07.510> hook<00:02:10.290> write<00:02:11.290> it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
going to get your second hook write it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.360 
going to get your second hook write it
just<00:02:11.440> like<00:02:11.740> that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
just like that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:23.760 
just like that
and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:14.470> come<00:02:14.980> back<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.520> pair<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.590> then

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
and then come back with a pair and then

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.580 
and then come back with a pair and then
just<00:02:24.040> cinch<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.459> down<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.370> hooks<00:02:31.590> can

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
just cinch it down so that the hooks can

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.740 
just cinch it down so that the hooks can
come<00:02:32.860> on

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
come on

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.170 
come on
not<00:02:34.750> too<00:02:34.990> tight<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:38.380> hook

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
not too tight you can see that the hook

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.500 
not too tight you can see that the hook
moves<00:02:40.180> reading<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:42.459> that's<00:02:42.550> very<00:02:42.940> important

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
moves reading and that's very important

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.490 
moves reading and that's very important
so<00:02:45.570> what<00:02:46.570> we're<00:02:46.690> going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> do<00:02:46.989> here<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.350> we're

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
so what we're going to do here is we're

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.350 
so what we're going to do here is we're
going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:48.510> going<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.630> put<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:51.360> just

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
going to get going to put this and just

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.400 
going to get going to put this and just
like<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:54.000> go<00:02:55.000> back<00:02:55.300> with<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.660> pair<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:55.959> pliers

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
like that go back with a pair of pliers

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.920 
like that go back with a pair of pliers
and<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.230> little<00:03:02.530> difficult<00:03:03.870> trying<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
and it's a little difficult trying to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.100 
and it's a little difficult trying to
film<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.590> do<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:07.600> basically<00:03:07.989> just

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
film it and do this but basically just

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.479 
film it and do this but basically just
going<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.500> go<00:03:08.620> ahead<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.130> close<00:03:09.850> that<00:03:10.150> back<00:03:10.330> up

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.590 

you<00:03:15.489> see<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.450> closed<00:03:18.150> cannot<00:03:19.150> go<00:03:19.330> back

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
you see that it is closed cannot go back

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.290 
you see that it is closed cannot go back
through<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:21.030> what<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.180> have

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.280 

is<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.650> three<00:03:29.220> rake<00:03:29.490> jig<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.780> now<00:03:33.930> what<00:03:34.110> we're

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
is a three rake jig so now what we're

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.430 
is a three rake jig so now what we're
going<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.470> do<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:35.480> you're<00:03:36.480> going<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.810> put<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440

nose of the ballyhoo through that tip

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.260 
nose of the ballyhoo through that tip
and<00:03:42.620> continue<00:03:43.620> on<00:03:43.800> feeding<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.760> back<00:03:44.940> loop

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
and continue on feeding the back loop

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.600
