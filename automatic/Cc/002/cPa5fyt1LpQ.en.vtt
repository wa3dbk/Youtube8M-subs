again we need to cleanse your face and
then<00:00:05.090> you<00:00:05.120> need<00:00:05.420> to<00:00:05.560> sterilize<00:00:06.560> your<00:00:06.859> needle

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
then you need to sterilize your needle

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.289 
then you need to sterilize your needle
with<00:00:09.440> some<00:00:09.740> needles<00:00:10.190> you<00:00:10.400> get<00:00:10.580> a<00:00:10.610> sterilizing

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
with some needles you get a sterilizing

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.970 
with some needles you get a sterilizing
the<00:00:11.389> solution<00:00:11.900> that<00:00:12.049> you<00:00:12.139> just<00:00:12.380> spray<00:00:14.980> but

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
with the MTS roller that I'm using you

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.330 
with the MTS roller that I'm using you
get<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.779> tray<00:00:21.140> with<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.380> sponge<00:00:21.800> earning<00:00:22.189> you

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
get a tray with a sponge earning you

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.820 
get a tray with a sponge earning you
just<00:00:22.609> pour<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.600> solution<00:00:23.810> onto<00:00:24.260> the<00:00:24.470> sponge

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
just pour the solution onto the sponge

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.230 
just pour the solution onto the sponge
and<00:00:25.220> then<00:00:25.880> roller<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:28.460> needle<00:00:28.849> over<00:00:28.970> the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
and then roller the needle over the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.550 
and then roller the needle over the
sponge<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:30.740> make<00:00:30.949> sure<00:00:31.160> it's<00:00:31.340> all<00:00:31.609> there<00:00:31.880> all

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
sponge and make sure it's all there all

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.500 
sponge and make sure it's all there all
covered<00:00:33.560> and<00:00:34.250> then<00:00:34.460> just<00:00:34.670> allow<00:00:34.940> it<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.150> dry

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
covered and then just allow it to dry

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.560 
covered and then just allow it to dry
and<00:00:38.510> then<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.470> begin<00:00:39.800> with<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:40.550> apply<00:00:40.970> your

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
and then to begin with you apply your

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.100 
and then to begin with you apply your
serum<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.610> roller<00:00:43.610> baton<00:00:44.240> or<00:00:44.540> you<00:00:44.840> could

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
serum and roller baton or you could

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.880 
serum and roller baton or you could
roller<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.040> then<00:00:46.280> apply<00:00:46.640> your<00:00:46.670> serum<00:00:47.860> you<00:00:48.860> can

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
roller and then apply your serum you can

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.850 
roller and then apply your serum you can
just<00:00:49.730> use<00:00:49.910> one<00:00:49.940> serum<00:00:50.690> or<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:51.140> can<00:00:51.350> use<00:00:51.830> a

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
just use one serum or you can use a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.720 
just use one serum or you can use a
couple<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.790> different<00:00:52.970> ones<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.660> tend<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.440> use

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
couple of different ones I tend to use

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.730 
couple of different ones I tend to use
use<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.760> growth<00:00:56.150> factor<00:00:56.420> roll<00:00:56.870> of<00:00:57.080> that<00:00:57.230> in<00:00:57.500> and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
use a growth factor roll of that in and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:05.259 
use a growth factor roll of that in and
then<00:00:58.460> apply<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:58.850> retinol<00:00:59.710> afterwards<00:01:03.970> you<00:01:04.970> tend

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
then apply a retinol afterwards you tend

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.120 
then apply a retinol afterwards you tend
to<00:01:05.420> use<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.630> growth<00:01:05.990> factor<00:01:06.230> serum<00:01:06.920> or<00:01:07.100> a

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
to use a growth factor serum or a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.480 
to use a growth factor serum or a
vitamin<00:01:07.670> C<00:01:08.000> or<00:01:08.900> a<00:01:08.960> vitamin<00:01:09.260> A<00:01:09.650> serum<00:01:10.190> when

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
vitamin C or a vitamin A serum when

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.480 
vitamin C or a vitamin A serum when
you're<00:01:10.670> needling<00:01:11.500> so<00:01:12.500> I'm<00:01:12.740> using<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.220> growth

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
you're needling so I'm using a growth

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.400 
you're needling so I'm using a growth
factor<00:01:13.730> so<00:01:14.030> I'm<00:01:14.120> going<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.450> apply<00:01:14.690> my<00:01:15.080> growth

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
factor so I'm going to apply my growth

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:24.150 
factor so I'm going to apply my growth
factor<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:17.110> then<00:01:18.110> roll<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.620> duct<00:01:18.830> in

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.890 

applying<00:01:25.160> my<00:01:26.980> growth<00:01:27.980> factor<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.780> then<00:01:29.780> I'm

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
applying my growth factor and then I'm

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.010 
applying my growth factor and then I'm
ready<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.290> start<00:01:30.530> needling<00:01:31.450> with<00:01:32.450> most<00:01:32.720> derma

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
ready to start needling with most derma

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.410 
ready to start needling with most derma
roller<00:01:33.380> instructions<00:01:34.040> they<00:01:34.220> say<00:01:34.640> rolling

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
roller instructions they say rolling

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.010 
roller instructions they say rolling
four<00:01:35.960> directions<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.010> you're<00:01:37.190> rolling

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
four directions so you're rolling

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.740 
four directions so you're rolling
horizontally<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.260> vertically<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.940> also

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
horizontally and vertically and also

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.550 
horizontally and vertically and also
both<00:01:42.250> diagonally<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:44.659> they<00:01:44.990> tend<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:45.350> say

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
both diagonally and they tend to say

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.390 
both diagonally and they tend to say
between<00:01:45.950> four<00:01:46.460> times<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:48.440> up<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.830> ten<00:01:49.100> times

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
between four times to up to ten times

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.790 
between four times to up to ten times
but<00:01:50.060> you'd<00:01:50.330> start<00:01:50.690> with<00:01:50.900> following<00:01:51.470> four

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
but you'd start with following four

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800 
but you'd start with following four
times<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.400> begin<00:01:52.520> with<00:01:52.880> if<00:01:53.180> you've<00:01:53.330> not<00:01:53.570> roll

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
times to begin with if you've not roll

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.130 
times to begin with if you've not roll
it<00:01:53.990> before<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.850> then<00:01:56.060> other<00:01:56.440> rollers<00:01:59.140> either

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
it before and then other rollers either

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.310 
it before and then other rollers either
you<00:02:00.590> roll<00:02:01.070> them<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.400> two<00:02:01.670> directions

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
you roll them in two directions

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.580 
you roll them in two directions
horizontally<00:02:03.320> or<00:02:03.380> vertically<00:02:03.830> ten<00:02:04.220> times<00:02:04.610> or

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
horizontally or vertically ten times or

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.120 
horizontally or vertically ten times or
10<00:02:06.590> times<00:02:07.780> diagonally<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.019> star<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.860> you

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
10 times diagonally like a star and you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.449 
10 times diagonally like a star and you
rolled<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.580> ten<00:02:11.209> times<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.959> would<00:02:12.920> follow<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
rolled that ten times I would follow the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.840 
rolled that ten times I would follow the
instructions<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.450> needle

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
instructions on the needle

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.720 
instructions on the needle
you're<00:02:15.030> using<00:02:16.130> but<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.160> wouldn't<00:02:17.460> worry<00:02:17.610> too

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
you're using but I wouldn't worry too

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.570 
you're using but I wouldn't worry too
much<00:02:17.970> about<00:02:18.210> your<00:02:18.570> technique<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:20.100> aim<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
much about your technique the aim is to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.080 
much about your technique the aim is to
get<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.750> whole<00:02:21.990> area

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
get the whole area

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.910 
get the whole area
treated

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
treated

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.660 
treated
I<00:02:26.000> remember<00:02:27.000> slight<00:02:27.420> pressure<00:02:28.350> not<00:02:28.980> too<00:02:29.400> much

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
I remember slight pressure not too much

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.750 
I remember slight pressure not too much
pressure<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.680> most<00:02:31.860> important<00:02:32.370> thing<00:02:32.550> is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
pressure and the most important thing is

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.300 
pressure and the most important thing is
to<00:02:33.000> roll<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.600> back<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.140> forth<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.680> don't<00:02:35.010> lift

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
to roll it back and forth and don't lift

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
to roll it back and forth and don't lift
or<00:02:35.580> off<00:02:36.020> from<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.170> skin<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.220> you're<00:02:38.460> rolling

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
or off from the skin so you're rolling

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.800 
or off from the skin so you're rolling
back<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.630> forth<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.970> best<00:02:42.180> thing<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.390> do<00:02:42.630> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
back and forth the best thing to do is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.080 
back and forth the best thing to do is
divide<00:02:43.260> your<00:02:43.500> face<00:02:43.710> up<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.250> treat<00:02:44.490> one<00:02:44.730> area

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
divide your face up and treat one area

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.440 
divide your face up and treat one area
at<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.210> time<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.810> move<00:02:46.080> on<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:48.210> going

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
at a time and then move on so I'm going

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.050 
at a time and then move on so I'm going
to<00:02:48.480> start<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.410> cheek<00:02:49.740> area<00:02:50.060> so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
to start with the cheek area so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.230 
to start with the cheek area so
literally<00:02:51.600> I'm<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.590> start<00:02:52.890> rolling

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
literally I'm going to start rolling

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.330 
literally I'm going to start rolling
four<00:02:54.240> times<00:02:54.740> horizontally<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.190> I'll

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
four times horizontally and then I'll

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.730 
four times horizontally and then I'll
change<00:02:56.640> vertically<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:58.080> I'll<00:02:58.260> do<00:02:58.500> both

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
change vertically then I'll do both

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.490 
change vertically then I'll do both
diagonally<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.820> well

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.150 

so<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.640> pull<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.120> skin<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.740> bit<00:03:06.920> taut<00:03:07.310> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
so you pull the skin just a bit taut and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:31.420 
so you pull the skin just a bit taut and
so<00:03:10.160> I'm<00:03:10.220> going<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.520> start

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:42.459 

I'm<00:03:31.969> sorry<00:03:32.269> literally<00:03:32.750> not<00:03:32.959> lifting<00:03:33.530> off<00:03:41.469> then

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 
I'm sorry literally not lifting off then

00:03:42.469 --> 00:04:11.400 
I'm sorry literally not lifting off then
I'm<00:03:42.650> going<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:42.980> go<00:03:43.959> horizontally

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:24.810 

I'm<00:04:12.410> applying<00:04:13.190> very<00:04:13.700> little<00:04:14.090> pressure<00:04:14.330> really

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:05:05.480 

and<00:04:25.690> I'm<00:04:25.840> gonna<00:04:27.360> die<00:04:28.360> on<00:04:28.420> me

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.550 

very<00:05:06.060> quick<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.570> easy<00:05:06.660> that<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.169> could<00:05:07.380> do

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
very quick and easy that you could do

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.530 
very quick and easy that you could do
your<00:05:07.800> face<00:05:08.040> within<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.430> few<00:05:08.639> minutes<00:05:08.820> her<00:05:09.330> whole

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
your face within a few minutes her whole

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.140 
your face within a few minutes her whole
face<00:05:10.699> okay<00:05:11.699> so<00:05:11.759> that's<00:05:12.030> mainly<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:14.370> one<00:05:14.610> cheek

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
face okay so that's mainly the one cheek

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.510 
face okay so that's mainly the one cheek
and<00:05:15.570> then<00:05:15.870> you<00:05:16.050> literally<00:05:16.620> just<00:05:16.919> move<00:05:17.250> over

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
and then you literally just move over

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.350 
and then you literally just move over
areas<00:05:19.039> with<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.160> awkward<00:05:20.550> areas<00:05:20.729> like<00:05:21.180> the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
areas with the awkward areas like the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.659 
areas with the awkward areas like the
nose<00:05:21.570> you<00:05:21.870> probably<00:05:22.199> wouldn't<00:05:22.500> get<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:23.550> know

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
nose you probably wouldn't get you know

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.890 
nose you probably wouldn't get you know
every<00:05:24.090> direction<00:05:24.479> so<00:05:26.360> your<00:05:27.360> best<00:05:27.570> just

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
every direction so your best just

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.930 
every direction so your best just
treating<00:05:30.740> maybe<00:05:31.740> just<00:05:32.070> horizontal<00:05:32.789> and

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
treating maybe just horizontal and

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:42.500 
treating maybe just horizontal and
vertical<00:05:39.080> with<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.169> nose<00:05:40.410> area<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.510> again

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
vertical with the nose area and again

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:51.260 
vertical with the nose area and again
with<00:05:43.789> with<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:44.970> chin<00:05:49.340> probably<00:05:50.340> just<00:05:50.520> do<00:05:51.000> one

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
with with the chin probably just do one

00:05:51.270 --> 00:06:10.910 
with with the chin probably just do one
side<00:05:51.570> of<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.900> chin<00:05:52.169> first

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.550 

and<00:06:11.370> again<00:06:11.670> the<00:06:11.910> other<00:06:11.940> side<00:06:12.330> of<00:06:12.510> the<00:06:12.630> chin<00:06:13.230> the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
and again the other side of the chin the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.150 
and again the other side of the chin the
cheek

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
cheek

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:33.890 
cheek
and<00:06:14.250> then<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.640> forehead

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.310
