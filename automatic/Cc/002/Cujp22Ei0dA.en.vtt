00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 yes you people I have a few 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.269
 people asked hey why pull what is 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 because at all a jailbreak you have us 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.320
 shown how to jailbreak that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 Best jailbreak tricks shown but what 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.460
 is in the true sense of a jailbreak 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 I would like to answer that today 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.810
 a jailbreak is in the true sense 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.269
 a process in which actually 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.580
 closed file system of ios so 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.489
 that the system of iphone ipod touch 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.380
 and ipad is going to be bypassed 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.850
 certain security mechanisms 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 actually prevent that from happening 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 software except the from the app store and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 The software authorized by Apple 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.620
 will be installed by apple authorized 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.510
 software he can for example also the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 are the developers use their 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.690
 to test apps before entering the app 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 store are transferred 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 This is an installation in the end 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.899
 I can do third-party apps 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.699
 I would like to explain that to you 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.070
 that can best be imagined 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.750
 let's imagine we have a room 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.609
 where before a security check 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 takes place before getting in there 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.770
 the room can be a recording studio or 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.439
 a tv studio or a lab to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 example the room represents the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.290
 software ios since the control and the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.270
 Functions of the room are through the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 skin who exemplifies so 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.119
 Example with the new A6 chip in the iphone 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.189
 5 or something that is hardware and the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 is a function as it were 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.560
 more quickly 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.479
 So now only people come through the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.000
 security control of the one apple 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.950
 Authorized badge now exists 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.079
 but the jailbreakers the people the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.090
 ideally brakes develop and seek 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.210
 now targeted in the wall of the room 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.220
 for example, they or holes 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.920
 looking through a possibility somehow 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.380
 to get a function in the room 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.610
 that can be called there for example 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.170
 every week, for example, when you look at yourself 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.119
 that as a television studio presents each 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.380
 week there is a new camera and me 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.299
 I can now somehow in the camera 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 dranhÃ¤ngen that no one notices and then 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.540
 I come in with a room and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.030
 out and can so software in and out 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.170
 transport normally so you look 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.909
 that can imagine 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 that is basically taken then the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.539
 jailbreak in itself who apple the hole 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.520
 There are two options for fixing 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.380
 Either she brings a new version 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.810
 from ios so well 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.310
 update a software update but that works 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.830
 only if it is a hole in the example 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.090
 room is if there is a mistake in 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.920
 the function is when i for example 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.080
 the camera every week new 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.200
 is introduced then slip into it 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.540
 Can the apple only through hard reha 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.010
 traffics that means these different ones 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.570
 security holes if you have a 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.530
 The safety gap is called this 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.850
 then exploit 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.730
 that is English and means as much as 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.710
 exploit if you exploit so one 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.940
 if you have that in the software then 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.740
 Can the apple by a simple 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.660
 update fixed but when you're in it to the 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.090
 skin he is then called log 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.070
 bootrom exploit so one of the on 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.690
 lower level is that apple not the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.300
 can fix with a software update 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.040
 but only by a hardware update 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.500
 So something new and so on 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.450
 then it may as stated by the apple 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.250
 new hardware fix turn jailbreak 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.700
 is carried out a new program 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.340
 install a program manager for 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.110
 unauthorized apps and that calls 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.940
 Silvia is still there 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.350
 alternative to it but see you is the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.240
 most used and actually also on 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.820
 most widespread but what are 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.890
 now the advantages of a jailbreak now 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.780
 First of all, a jailbreak brings a lot 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.520
 many possibilities for new ones 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.370
 add features 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.610
 these include, for example, new ones 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.740
 animations 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.240
 i can change that look or me 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.220
 For example, it can quickly adjust settings 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.140
 in the notification center for example 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.130
 insert 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.200
 In addition, a jailbreak brings more 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.520
 safety that sounds weird because now 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.080
 I actually the system more 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.940
 make it vulnerable by having it 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.410
 open and not only through this 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.510
 certain interfaces that possible 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.040
 made by apple software 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.280
 can bring in but also different 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.350
 but the jailbreak community is active 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.000
 and if anything happens then 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.209
 it usually goes much faster that 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.680
 some fix by jailbreak developer 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.480
 comes up as through apple so you can 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.250
 say the jailbreak makes the device 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.110
 actually safer 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.940
 or you can, for example, the 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.670
 suppress location by advertising 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.470
 What else apple does not allow one too 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.320
 advantage for your own safety 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.240
 you can change the look you can 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.400
 Add teams that's what it's called 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.440
 there was a whole lot of work to do 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.350
 After that, you can adjust that and 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.760
 bring ios under his control and 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.740
 that's a thing 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.670
 I think people like to have control 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.560
 and therefore 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.260
 like that many people but what and 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.550
 disadvantages of the jailbreak now it is very 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.980
 unlikely but it has to be here 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.600
 The device can be mentioned by the 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.950
 jailbreak be damaged 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.470
 the likelihood is 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.300
 very low the jailbreak are very 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.670
 extensively tested and in case of problems 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.920
 there is usually a report so immediately 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.780
 if you are reasonably up to date 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.820
 nothing should happen there 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.900
 That's why I can only recommend you 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.220
 subscribe to the channel and you are always 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.440
 up to date if anything important 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.090
 even if that happens, that's it 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.820
 device does not start, for example 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.040
 then it is in 90 so in more than 99 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.840
 percent of cases possible without the device 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.000
 to restore problems and on the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.100
 to reset the initial state so that 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.810
 There is no problem at all 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.730
 like before and I can do it again 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.860
 make it go normally when 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.150
 I sync regularly as well 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.590
 no data lost 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.690
 another thing is that for example 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.000
 can lead to faulty functions 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.470
 the most just after the beginnings of the 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.900
 jailbreaks like for example now at 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.380
 ebay already when I turn the video here 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.880
 is currently the 6.1 jailbreak currently there 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.130
 For example, the weather app did not work 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.930
 but also came out with a fix 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.960
 and that should work again 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.370
 a very big criticism is that the 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.470
 Battery consumption can rise 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.450
 depending on how many new features I have 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.390
 install the battery consumption of the 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.310
 but it does not have to rise significantly 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.650
 another thing is apple can 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.470
 problems with the guarantee resp 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.640
 Guarantee is the guarantee 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.800
 a voluntary benefit of the 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.720
 manufacturer can therefore be forfeited 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.670
 I already have a video link 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.230
 to it in the video description where he 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.240
 that I can take a close look like that 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.010
 is with legality of the jailbreak he is 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.960
 by the way legally but also like it with 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.820
 Warranty and guarantee is left 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.920
 as I said in the video description 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.320
 Another problem is that you always 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.850
 new gaps need a jailbreak 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.100
 It is always easy to develop 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.240
 harder because it is so amazing 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.980
 that's for sure 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.290
 There was a comparison of the said 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.350
 that ios is now safer than that 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.150
 Most nuclear bunkers in this world because 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.980
 it just by being so much 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.320
 was attacked by the jailbreak 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.240
 I say so much fixed and 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.120
 it was repaired by apple 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.160
 system incredibly safe and there it gets 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.630
 really difficult with time always new 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.320
 to find security holes you 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.390
 exploit 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.550
 can then use this so-called explorer 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.350
 can use to jailbreak too 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.510
 develop and that is my opinion for 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.490
 jailbreak now i have shown it and 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.380
 I use it actively I like the jailbreak 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.250
 Of course you have to be careful with 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.110
 some functions 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.490
 but you can always return 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.960
 I love the new ones 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.520
 functions that arise as a result and 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.440
 can only recommend it 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.420
 whether you are direct or not and how 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.550
 your opinion is that is completely at 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.200
 Thank you then for seeing you 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.310
