00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
first thing I would do would be to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.190 
first thing I would do would be to
actually<00:01:53.069> take<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.550> look<00:01:53.759> at<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> mask<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.539> as

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.529 
you can see this mask is quite a happy
mask<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.940> little<00:02:00.149> look<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
mask and I have a little look at the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.770 
mask and I have a little look at the
mask<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.080> then<00:02:01.619> try<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.039> put<00:02:02.250> my<00:02:02.640> face<00:02:03.030> into

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
mask and then try and put my face into

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.589 
mask and then try and put my face into
the<00:02:04.140> same<00:02:04.560> shape<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.250> mask<00:02:08.239> after<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the same shape as the mask after that I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.520 
the same shape as the mask after that I
put<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> mask<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.830> my<00:02:11.580> face<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:13.080> try<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
put the mask on my face and then try and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610 
put the mask on my face and then try and
take<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.129> upper<00:02:14.430> body<00:02:14.599> position<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:16.379> I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
take you upper body position that I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.150 
take you upper body position that I
think<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.370> suitable<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> mask<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.709> let's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
think is suitable for the mask so let's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:45.619 
think is suitable for the mask so let's
have<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> go

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.869 

now<00:02:46.629> you<00:02:47.049> would<00:02:47.230> have<00:02:47.260> noticed<00:02:47.530> maybe<00:02:48.489> one<00:02:48.760> or

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
now you would have noticed maybe one or

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.660 
now you would have noticed maybe one or
two<00:02:48.909> things<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.430> didn't<00:02:51.430> say

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
two things that one is I didn't say

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.319 
two things that one is I didn't say
anything<00:02:51.879> these<00:02:52.870> full<00:02:53.290> marks<00:02:53.709> can't<00:02:54.190> speak<00:02:54.700> so

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
anything these full marks can't speak so

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.280 
anything these full marks can't speak so
I<00:02:55.569> have<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.049> use<00:02:56.290> my<00:02:56.739> body<00:02:57.010> language<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:58.659> show

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
I have to use my body language to show

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.000 
I have to use my body language to show
the<00:02:59.739> expression<00:03:00.640> on<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.269> mask<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.590> other

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
the expression on the mask the other

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.630 
the expression on the mask the other
thing<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.540> turned<00:03:04.989> away<00:03:05.400> when<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.430> took

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
thing is that I turned away when I took

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.420 
thing is that I turned away when I took
the<00:03:07.239> mask<00:03:07.450> off<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.049> there's<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.890> good<00:03:09.400> reason

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
the mask off and there's a good reason

the mask off and there's a good reason
for<00:03:09.879> this<00:03:10.620> other<00:03:11.620> masks<00:03:12.370> don't<00:03:12.819> like<00:03:13.390> seeing<00:03:14.170> a

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
for this other masks don't like seeing a

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.559 
for this other masks don't like seeing a
marks<00:03:14.859> being<00:03:15.190> taken<00:03:15.639> off<00:03:15.909> it's<00:03:16.239> as<00:03:16.420> if

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
marks being taken off it's as if

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.899 
marks being taken off it's as if
somebody's<00:03:17.019> peeling<00:03:17.470> their<00:03:17.650> face<00:03:17.920> off<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.849> a

somebody's peeling their face off have a

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:29.099 
somebody's peeling their face off have a
look<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.799> can<00:03:27.190> dispose<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:28.000> magic<00:03:28.450> so

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
look it can dispose the magic so

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.009 
look it can dispose the magic so
whenever<00:03:29.859> you<00:03:30.069> take<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.579> mask<00:03:30.849> off<00:03:31.030> first

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
should look at another mask so here's a

mask with their a completely different
expression<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:53.560> one<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:55.260> little<00:03:56.260> bit<00:03:56.440> sad

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
expression this one is a little bit sad

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.990 
expression this one is a little bit sad
maybe<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.030> little<00:03:58.299> bit<00:03:58.419> shy<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.280> do<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.760> same

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
maybe a little bit shy so I do the same

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.619 
maybe a little bit shy so I do the same
technique<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:02.099> first<00:04:03.099> of<00:04:03.280> all<00:04:03.400> adjust<00:04:04.389> the

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
technique I first of all adjust the

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.890 
technique I first of all adjust the
strap<00:04:05.109> so<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:06.160> strap<00:04:06.579> is<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
strap so that the strap is that the

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.319 
strap so that the strap is that the
right<00:04:08.109> length<00:04:09.209> then<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.449> look<00:04:10.810> at<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.019> mask<00:04:11.260> I

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
right length then I look at the mask I

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.479 
right length then I look at the mask I
try<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.389> put<00:04:13.629> my<00:04:13.810> face<00:04:14.109> into<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.680> same<00:04:14.949> shape

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
try and put my face into the same shape

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.800 
try and put my face into the same shape
as<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:15.790> mask<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:18.150> then<00:04:19.150> I'm<00:04:19.269> going<00:04:19.449> to<00:04:19.479> put<00:04:19.690> it

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
as the mask and then I'm going to put it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.649 
as the mask and then I'm going to put it
on<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.199> let<00:04:20.680> my<00:04:20.829> body<00:04:21.130> take<00:04:21.849> over<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.389> same

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
on and let my body take over the same

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:42.060 
on and let my body take over the same
shape<00:04:23.400> let's<00:04:24.400> have<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.580> go

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.250 

now<00:04:42.700> one<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.480> things<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:43.930> might<00:04:44.110> have

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
now one of the things you might have

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.580 
now one of the things you might have
noticed<00:04:44.740> with<00:04:44.950> these<00:04:45.190> masks<00:04:45.730> is<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:46.450> have<00:04:47.290> to

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
noticed with these masks is I have to

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.420 
noticed with these masks is I have to
stay<00:04:48.060> facing<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.480> front<00:04:49.870> because<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.040> turn

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
stay facing the front because if I turn

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.450 
stay facing the front because if I turn
my<00:04:51.700> head<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.300> one<00:04:52.930> side<00:04:53.290> or<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.620> other<00:04:53.710> then

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
my head to one side or the other then

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.680 
my head to one side or the other then
you<00:04:54.670> very<00:04:55.000> quickly<00:04:55.390> see<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:57.100> line<00:04:57.690> that

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
you very quickly see the the line that

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.220 
you very quickly see the the line that
comes<00:04:59.050> down<00:04:59.860> here<00:05:00.400> between<00:05:00.640> my<00:05:01.120> my<00:05:01.720> head<00:05:01.990> in<00:05:02.110> my

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
comes down here between my my head in my

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.710 
comes down here between my my head in my
face<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.800> sometimes<00:05:03.580> this<00:05:04.000> looks<00:05:04.270> as<00:05:04.420> if<00:05:04.570> I've

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
face and sometimes this looks as if I've

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.720 
face and sometimes this looks as if I've
just<00:05:04.900> got<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> false<00:05:05.410> face<00:05:05.710> stuck<00:05:06.130> on<00:05:06.310> front<00:05:06.610> of

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
just got a false face stuck on front of

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.910 
just got a false face stuck on front of
me<00:05:06.880> so<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.600> think<00:05:07.720> I'm<00:05:07.930> gonna<00:05:08.080> put<00:05:08.320> this<00:05:08.440> mask<00:05:08.680> on

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
me so I think I'm gonna put this mask on

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:39.640 
me so I think I'm gonna put this mask on
again<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:09.490> let<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.420> see<00:05:10.660> that

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.950 

so<00:05:40.650> we<00:05:40.830> have<00:05:41.069> two<00:05:41.430> main<00:05:41.699> ways<00:05:42.000> that<00:05:42.569> we<00:05:42.750> can

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
so we have two main ways that we can

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.339 
so we have two main ways that we can
cover<00:05:43.319> up<00:05:43.590> this<00:05:44.250> line<00:05:44.729> at<00:05:45.599> the<00:05:45.840> side<00:05:46.110> of<00:05:46.139> the

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
cover up this line at the side of the

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.249 
cover up this line at the side of the
mask<00:05:46.590> one<00:05:47.370> if<00:05:48.270> you<00:05:48.690> have<00:05:48.990> long<00:05:49.410> hair<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.250> can

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
mask one if you have long hair you can

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.800 
mask one if you have long hair you can
get<00:05:52.259> your<00:05:52.560> hair<00:05:52.800> to<00:05:53.580> cover<00:05:53.880> up<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.330> edges<00:05:54.449> and

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
get your hair to cover up the edges and

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.839 
get your hair to cover up the edges and
certainly<00:05:55.289> if<00:05:55.440> you've<00:05:55.560> got<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.800> fringe<00:05:56.250> then

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
certainly if you've got a fringe then

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.689 
certainly if you've got a fringe then
put<00:05:57.240> your<00:05:57.449> fringe<00:05:57.870> over<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.830> edges<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.580> the

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
put your fringe over the edges of the

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.600 
put your fringe over the edges of the
mask<00:05:59.910> the<00:06:00.780> other<00:06:00.810> big<00:06:01.440> way<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.889> we<00:06:02.009> use<00:06:02.280> is<00:06:02.550> we

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
mask the other big way that we use is we

00:06:02.610 --> 00:07:13.879 
mask the other big way that we use is we
use<00:06:03.180> hats<00:06:03.930> or<00:06:04.710> we<00:06:05.159> use<00:06:05.490> wigs

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:15.980 

and<00:07:13.979> the<00:07:14.580> last<00:07:14.849> thing<00:07:15.210> you<00:07:15.360> should<00:07:15.539> think<00:07:15.569> of

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
and the last thing you should think of

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.219 
and the last thing you should think of
when<00:07:16.590> you've<00:07:16.740> taken<00:07:17.009> your<00:07:17.370> mask<00:07:17.639> off<00:07:17.909> is<00:07:18.900> to

when you've taken your mask off is to
get<00:07:19.439> a<00:07:19.469> cloth<00:07:19.860> and<00:07:21.139> just<00:07:22.139> wipe<00:07:22.319> it<00:07:23.129> down<00:07:23.430> on<00:07:24.029> the
