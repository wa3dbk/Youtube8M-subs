 I poured out 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.930
 my sugar 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.150
 mansell 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.440
 and for the people 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.670
 the green well to monique 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.790

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.650
 pull it out of the fire pan 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.610
 and I did not understand the flour quickly 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.960
 in withdrawal is logically so that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 why not form government and especially there are many companies 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
 the pac 5 in the day on fire 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.260
 once the preparation of the summer 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.509
 from greece 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.659
 in a salad bowl 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.460
 ap and here I go a little bit like the principle of a taxation that I'm going 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.460
 put the eggs one by one 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.850
 it's the second goal 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 and I'm going to put my third 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.890
 my preparation is almost finished I'm going now 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.540

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.950
 other analysts put the key well the key 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.789
 the Internet 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.949

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.949
 Orange Blossom 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.839
 and to finalize 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.959
 trained to nice to the dough I'm going to put a little lash 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.629
 here is the waffle dough and freight that I will now be able to do 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.379
 to pose 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 about an hour in the fridge 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.170
 So here is the waffle dough to rest the legs but just a little 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.759
 whiplash story to give a little paw 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.769
 before pouring the dough left into the shield I'm going first 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.269

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.369
 21 meters 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.569

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.889
 three seconds 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.649
 and I return it to have a very good distribution between Patagonia 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:19.809
 I chose to put on the medium function to have a medium gilding 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.790
 and I preferred to rent the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.279
 others to the compromise 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.079
