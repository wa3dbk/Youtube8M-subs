half inch tall spring and the black one
is<00:00:51.430> 11<00:00:51.820> in<00:00:51.909> it<00:00:52.000> 11<00:00:52.600> inch<00:00:52.839> tall<00:00:53.409> spring<00:00:53.769> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
is 11 in it 11 inch tall spring the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.759 
is 11 in it 11 inch tall spring the
biggest<00:00:55.180> thing<00:00:55.420> that<00:00:56.019> we<00:00:56.140> need<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.320> take<00:00:56.589> into

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
biggest thing that we need to take into

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.119 
biggest thing that we need to take into
consideration<00:00:56.909> is<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:58.510> spring<00:00:59.409> rate<00:00:59.830> and

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
consideration is the spring rate and

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.460 
consideration is the spring rate and
what<00:01:00.369> the<00:01:00.489> spring<00:01:00.790> rate<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.330> is<00:01:01.869> the<00:01:02.080> amount<00:01:02.320> of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
what the spring rate is is the amount of

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.109 
what the spring rate is is the amount of
weight<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.220> will<00:01:03.339> take<00:01:03.549> to<00:01:03.699> compress

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
weight that it will take to compress

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.289 
weight that it will take to compress
this<00:01:04.330> 1<00:01:04.629> inch<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.080> that's<00:01:05.830> almost<00:01:06.340> all<00:01:06.760> spring

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
this 1 inch and that's almost all spring

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.320 
this 1 inch and that's almost all spring
rated<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:07.990> way<00:01:08.140> special<00:01:08.530> equations<00:01:09.189> so<00:01:09.850> this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
rated that way special equations so this

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.149 
rated that way special equations so this
one<00:01:10.540> for<00:01:10.689> example<00:01:10.780> is<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.409> set<00:01:11.650> under<00:01:11.920> pound

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
one for example is the set under pound

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.030 
one for example is the set under pound
spring<00:01:12.640> so<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:13.090> will<00:01:13.180> take<00:01:13.299> 700<00:01:13.900> pounds<00:01:14.439> to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
spring so it will take 700 pounds to

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.390 
spring so it will take 700 pounds to
compress<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.700> 1<00:01:16.030> inch<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:17.229> if<00:01:17.350> we<00:01:17.500> take<00:01:17.680> 1,400

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
compress this 1 inch so if we take 1,400

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.100 
compress this 1 inch so if we take 1,400
pounds<00:01:18.729> on<00:01:18.820> this<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.240> will<00:01:19.360> compress<00:01:19.689> it<00:01:19.900> 2

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
pounds on this it will compress it 2

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.039 
pounds on this it will compress it 2
inches<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.909> black<00:01:22.150> spring<00:01:22.450> here<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:23.020> a

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
inches the black spring here is a

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.770 
inches the black spring here is a
900-pound<00:01:23.860> spring<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.000> will<00:01:25.090> take<00:01:25.240> 900

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
900-pound spring so it will take 900

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.690 
900-pound spring so it will take 900
pounds<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.200> weight<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.890> compress<00:01:27.400> this<00:01:27.640> spring

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
pounds of weight to compress this spring

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.840 
pounds of weight to compress this spring
1<00:01:28.330> inch<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.890> other<00:01:30.040> thing<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.430> we<00:01:30.640> need<00:01:30.760> to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
1 inch the other thing that we need to

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.080 
1 inch the other thing that we need to
take<00:01:31.000> into<00:01:31.180> consideration<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.400> spring

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
take into consideration is the spring

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.600 
take into consideration is the spring
load<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.900> spring<00:01:35.260> load<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.920> spring<00:01:36.340> is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
load and the spring load of a spring is

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.149 
load and the spring load of a spring is
the<00:01:37.150> amount<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.170> weight<00:01:38.409> that<00:01:38.620> this<00:01:38.770> can

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the amount of weight that this can

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.970 
the amount of weight that this can
support<00:01:39.510> before<00:01:40.510> it's<00:01:40.630> totally<00:01:41.260> compressed

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
support before it's totally compressed

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.610 
support before it's totally compressed
so<00:01:42.700> if<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.120> maximum<00:01:43.510> amount<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.110> spring<00:01:44.440> can

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
so if the maximum amount the spring can

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.490 
so if the maximum amount the spring can
be<00:01:44.650> compressed<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.340> 6<00:01:45.760> inches<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:47.290> our

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
be compressed to 6 inches with our

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.490 
be compressed to 6 inches with our
rating<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.220> 700<00:01:48.820> pounds<00:01:49.420> per<00:01:49.630> inch<00:01:49.659> that<00:01:50.140> would

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
rating of 700 pounds per inch that would

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.100 
rating of 700 pounds per inch that would
give<00:01:50.950> us<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.280> spring<00:01:51.670> load<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.780> just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
give us a spring load and this is just

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.219 
give us a spring load and this is just
theoretical<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.040> this<00:01:54.250> spring<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.930> we

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
theoretical on this spring so we

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.530 
theoretical on this spring so we
compress<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.920> spring<00:01:57.190> 6<00:01:57.760> inches<00:01:58.060> before<00:01:58.420> it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
compress the spring 6 inches before it

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.080 
compress the spring 6 inches before it
will<00:01:58.720> stop<00:01:58.960> compressing<00:01:59.710> in<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.340> spring<00:02:00.729> rate

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
will stop compressing in the spring rate

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.180 
will stop compressing in the spring rate
is<00:02:01.420> 700<00:02:02.049> pounds<00:02:02.290> per<00:02:02.470> inch<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.710> will<00:02:02.890> give<00:02:03.070> us

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
is 700 pounds per inch that will give us

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.120 
is 700 pounds per inch that will give us
a<00:02:03.310> load<00:02:03.610> of<00:02:03.909> 4,200<00:02:04.600> pounds<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.590> basically<00:02:06.040> all

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
a load of 4,200 pounds and basically all

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.219 
a load of 4,200 pounds and basically all
we're<00:02:06.280> doing<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.580> taking<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.060> 700<00:02:07.690> pounds<00:02:08.019> per

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
we're doing is taking the 700 pounds per

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.259 
we're doing is taking the 700 pounds per
inch<00:02:08.409> times<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.429> 6<00:02:09.670> inches<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.119> it's

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
inch times the 6 inches that it's

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.170 
inch times the 6 inches that it's
compressed<00:02:10.659> now<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.860> black<00:02:12.190> spring<00:02:12.610> since

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
compressed now on the black spring since

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.420 
compressed now on the black spring since
it's<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.450> 900-pound<00:02:14.200> spring<00:02:15.129> and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
it's a 900-pound spring and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.400 
it's a 900-pound spring and
we'll<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.060> save<00:02:17.239> theoretically<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.170> our

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
we'll just save theoretically that our

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.199 
we'll just save theoretically that our
maximum<00:02:18.980> compression<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.940> eight

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
maximum compression on this is eight

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.900 
maximum compression on this is eight
inches<00:02:20.569> then<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.680> spring<00:02:22.099> load<00:02:22.520> will<00:02:22.880> be

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
inches then this spring load will be

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.330 
inches then this spring load will be
7,200<00:02:23.870> pounds<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.560> real<00:02:24.800> easy<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.099> figure

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
7,200 pounds so it's real easy to figure

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.150 
7,200 pounds so it's real easy to figure
out<00:02:26.020> most<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.200> these<00:02:27.349> Springs<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:27.980> for

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
out most of these Springs like for

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.070 
out most of these Springs like for
example<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.849> one<00:02:28.910> from<00:02:29.390> Africa<00:02:29.840> they

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
example on this one from Africa they

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.680 
example on this one from Africa they
always<00:02:30.380> each<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.040> rating<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.300> springs

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
always each the rating with the springs

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.490 
always each the rating with the springs
on<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.930> bottom<00:02:33.349> here<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:36.140> really

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
on the bottom here and that's really

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.740 
on the bottom here and that's really
easy<00:02:36.650> way<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.010> find<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.519> but<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.450> can<00:02:38.569> find

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
easy way to find out but if you can find

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.130 
easy way to find out but if you can find
out<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.349> maximum<00:02:40.160> compression<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.140> multiply

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
out the maximum compression and multiply

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.470 
out the maximum compression and multiply
that<00:02:42.319> by<00:02:42.380> your<00:02:42.680> spring<00:02:43.010> rate<00:02:43.370> then<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.360> is

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
that by your spring rate then that is

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.420 
that by your spring rate then that is
the<00:02:44.630> easiest<00:02:44.900> way<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.140> figure<00:02:45.680> out<00:02:45.830> what<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
the easiest way to figure out what the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.470 
the easiest way to figure out what the
spra<00:02:46.700> total<00:02:47.300> load<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:47.780> spring<00:02:48.170> will<00:02:48.290> be

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
spra total load of that spring will be

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.090 
spra total load of that spring will be
okay<00:02:50.480> just<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.810> recap<00:02:51.170> real<00:02:51.440> quick<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.890> talked

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
okay just a recap real quick we talked

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.920 
okay just a recap real quick we talked
about<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.519> spring<00:02:52.819> rate<00:02:53.209> which<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
about the spring rate which is the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.330 
about the spring rate which is the
amount<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.260> weight<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.650> takes<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:55.069> compress

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
amount of weight it takes to compress

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.370 
amount of weight it takes to compress
the<00:02:55.549> spring<00:02:55.760> one<00:02:56.269> inch<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.750> then<00:02:57.140> we<00:02:57.260> also

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the spring one inch and then we also

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.530 
the spring one inch and then we also
talked<00:02:57.739> about<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.430> spring<00:02:58.910> load<00:02:59.209> how<00:02:59.480> to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
talked about the spring load how to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.809 
talked about the spring load how to
calculate<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.319> you<00:03:00.620> basically<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.610> take

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
calculate that you basically just take

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.640 
calculate that you basically just take
the<00:03:02.090> maximum<00:03:02.420> compression<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.290> spring

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
the maximum compression of that spring

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.190 
the maximum compression of that spring
multiply<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.640> by<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:04.940> spring<00:03:05.690> rate<00:03:05.959> and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
multiply it by the spring rate and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.720 
multiply it by the spring rate and
you'll<00:03:06.680> get<00:03:06.830> your<00:03:06.890> maximum<00:03:07.519> load

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
you'll get your maximum load

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.660 
you'll get your maximum load
approximately<00:03:08.690> for<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.049> spring<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:10.400> again

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
approximately for that spring and again

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.640 
approximately for that spring and again
