00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
seeing that in this game that's kind of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.970 
seeing that in this game that's kind of
disappointing<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.410> makes<00:03:34.530> me<00:03:34.650> wonder<00:03:34.799> if

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
disappointing and it makes me wonder if

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.710 
disappointing and it makes me wonder if
if<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.549> has<00:03:36.000> something<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.329> do<00:03:36.450> with<00:03:36.540> them

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
if that has something to do with them

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.420 
if that has something to do with them

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
happened recently or it might just

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.900

that facial recognition software like
that<00:03:46.380> was<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.190> much<00:03:47.519> time<00:03:47.819> they<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:48.660> don't

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
that was so much time they just don't

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.960 
that was so much time they just don't
have<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.230> time<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.100> invest<00:03:50.519> in<00:03:50.670> their<00:03:50.790> games

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
and I just make it was but you do have

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.810 
and I just make it was but you do have
that<00:05:08.470> opportunity<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:09.039> save<00:05:09.220> yourself<00:05:09.639> going

that opportunity to save yourself going
into<00:05:10.000> bullet<00:05:10.210> time<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.320> looks<00:05:11.470> like

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
into bullet time so it looks like

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.420 
into bullet time so it looks like
they're<00:05:11.680> taking<00:05:11.770> bullet<00:05:12.070> time<00:05:12.190> something

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
they're taking bullet time something

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.610

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
question we were watching levels where

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.610 
question we were watching levels where
there<00:05:37.090> was<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.479> know<00:05:37.599> as<00:05:37.750> Max<00:05:37.990> Payne<00:05:38.229> and<00:05:38.530> the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
there was you know as Max Payne and the

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.070 
there was you know as Max Payne and the
girl<00:05:38.830> he<00:05:39.010> was<00:05:39.099> protecting<00:05:39.669> and<00:05:39.849> of<00:05:40.270> course<00:05:40.510> it

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
girl he was protecting and of course it

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.860 
girl he was protecting and of course it
seemed<00:05:41.650> like<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.800> very<00:05:41.919> traditional<00:05:42.669> setup<00:05:43.450> for

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
seemed like a very traditional setup for

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.690 
seemed like a very traditional setup for
a<00:05:43.900> co-op<00:05:44.229> level<00:05:44.740> where<00:05:45.160> they<00:05:45.280> kind<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.580> get

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
a co-op level where they kind of get

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.339 
a co-op level where they kind of get
split<00:05:46.030> up<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.300> one<00:05:46.479> has<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.810> open<00:05:46.930> a<00:05:47.139> door<00:05:47.320> for

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
split up and one has to open a door for

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.500 
split up and one has to open a door for
another<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.070> they<00:05:48.190> have<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.460> meet<00:05:48.639> up<00:05:48.789> and<00:05:49.000> so

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
another and they have to meet up and so

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.850 
another and they have to meet up and so
they<00:05:49.780> wouldn't<00:05:49.930> say<00:05:50.139> anything<00:05:50.169> officially
