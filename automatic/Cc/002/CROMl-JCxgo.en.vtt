00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.789 

let<00:02:39.790> me<00:02:39.909> have<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.329> bridge<00:02:40.689> section<00:02:41.200> which<00:02:41.620> is

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
let me have the bridge section which is

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.380 
let me have the bridge section which is
two<00:02:42.010> chords<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.819> either<00:02:42.909> pair<00:02:43.209> them<00:02:43.329> as

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
two chords you can either pair them as

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.460 
two chords you can either pair them as
full<00:02:43.629> chords<00:02:43.900> or<00:02:43.989> power<00:02:44.319> chords<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.189> a<00:02:45.250> B

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.830 

and<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:51.459> so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.910 

and<00:02:56.410> then<00:02:57.310> back<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.520> a<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:02.349> goes<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.680> there<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
and then back to a it goes on there a

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.600 
and then back to a it goes on there a
few<00:03:03.190> times

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
few times

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.020 
few times
and<00:03:03.760> then<00:03:04.239> we<00:03:04.360> have<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.870> solo<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.670> solo

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
and then we have the solo so the solo

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:24.540 
and then we have the solo so the solo
goes<00:03:07.450> up<00:03:07.630> this

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.530 

so<00:03:25.550> it's<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.270> c-sharp<00:03:26.950> pentatonic<00:03:27.950> minor

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
so it's in a c-sharp pentatonic minor

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.780 
so it's in a c-sharp pentatonic minor
pattern<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.530> we're<00:03:30.620> gonna<00:03:30.709> start<00:03:30.980> off<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.489> on

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
pattern so we're gonna start off here on

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:43.559 
pattern so we're gonna start off here on
the<00:03:32.030> 12th<00:03:32.900> fret<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.760> that's<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.060> first<00:03:38.270> thing

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:56.979 

that's<00:03:44.569> 12<00:03:44.959> 9<00:03:46.930> 12<00:03:48.430> 12<00:03:52.630> 12<00:03:53.709> 9<00:03:55.150> 12<00:03:56.150> then<00:03:56.900> we're

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
that's 12 9 12 12 12 9 12 then we're

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:07.059 
that's 12 9 12 12 12 9 12 then we're
gonna<00:03:57.110> bend<00:03:57.350> up

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.160 

so<00:04:08.060> again<00:04:08.269> slowly<00:04:08.540> one<00:04:08.810> more<00:04:08.959> time<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:15.049> we're

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
so again slowly one more time and we're

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.699 
so again slowly one more time and we're
gonna<00:04:15.260> bend<00:04:15.470> up<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.739> tone<00:04:17.229> I'm<00:04:18.229> gonna<00:04:18.440> play<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
gonna bend up a tone I'm gonna play the

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.920 
gonna bend up a tone I'm gonna play the
11th<00:04:19.190> on<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.579> E<00:04:19.609> string<00:04:20.560> 12<00:04:22.540> bend<00:04:23.540> up<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:23.720> tone

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
11th on the E string 12 bend up a tone

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.469 
11th on the E string 12 bend up a tone
again<00:04:25.720> then<00:04:26.720> back<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:28.150> 9

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
again then back to 9

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:38.620 
again then back to 9
so<00:04:29.720> that<00:04:29.870> whole<00:04:30.050> part<00:04:37.150> we're<00:04:38.150> gonna<00:04:38.240> come<00:04:38.450> down

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
so that whole part we're gonna come down

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.250 
so that whole part we're gonna come down
to<00:04:38.660> 11<00:04:40.000> 9<00:04:42.130> back<00:04:43.130> up<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.400> 11<00:04:43.460> then<00:04:44.360> they<00:04:44.479> play<00:04:44.750> two

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
to 11 9 back up to 11 then they play two

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.070 
to 11 9 back up to 11 then they play two
tons<00:04:45.620> on<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:46.130> 11<00:04:46.750> two<00:04:47.750> times<00:04:48.050> on<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.350> 9<00:04:50.080> and

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
tons on the 11 two times on the 9 and

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.740 
tons on the 11 two times on the 9 and
then<00:04:51.169> one<00:04:51.410> time<00:04:51.620> on<00:04:51.770> 11<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.210> D<00:04:53.419> string

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
then one time on 11 on the D string

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:02.090 
then one time on 11 on the D string
so<00:04:54.020> that

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.830 

I'm<00:05:03.100> going<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.340> slide<00:05:03.610> up<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.000> knife<00:05:06.840> then

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
I'm going to slide up to the knife then

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:18.450 
I'm going to slide up to the knife then
slide<00:05:08.140> up<00:05:08.170> to<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.470> 12<00:05:08.770> 6<00:05:12.060> 9<00:05:13.140> 12<00:05:17.010> up<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.220> 9
