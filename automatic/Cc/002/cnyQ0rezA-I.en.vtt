00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.610
 and here we are to another dragon video in 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.470
 which is the temple of anchors and my 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.570
 recommendation is that they do not go by the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.939
 dragon to clash no no do not try to 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.369
 complete this temple for the following 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.570
 reasons that I'm going to give them ok good for 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.570
 start we have what is the first 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.399
 pillar is the first column that are 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.860
 coins coins are things 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.140
 easy are the dragons names 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.250
 wait time and we will give coins 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.050
 independently independently 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.850
 of the time it lasts I think this 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.280
 variation is a hard projection 20 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.310
 hours can you give us 2000 coins are 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.079
 1600 coins approximately not the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.660
 first pillar is simple then it is 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.970
 just a matter of waiting is not the great 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.550
 thing will take a few days about four days 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.200
 in what are all the appearances for 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.460
 power to get enough 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.340
 coins and complete the temple 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.310
 what I did not like was the second pillar 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.159
 as you can see the second pillar we 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.740
 asks what is a million food that 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.500
 it's a lot of food a million 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.090
 each bar that are four totals 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.460
 or know that in total we would already be like 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.610
 more than four million food that very 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.899
 well this food could serve us for 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.060
 to increase the level of some dragon 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.340
 so it 's too much food 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.439
 million is too much I do have the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.689
 food needed to fill the pillar 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.900
 but I do not want to spend the waste on 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.850
 this ok 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.280
 finally sixth the third pillar that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.500
 it is very complicated the truth happened for 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.150
 complete it we would be a total of 45 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.880
 gems or send what are invitations to 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.800
 our friends and well many of my 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.870
 friends the set next they get mad at that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.550
 from sending them game invitations 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.850
 of facebook because they are like 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.870
 spam notifications could be said 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.650
 because the truth is very complicated 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.390
 send him dragon invitations you 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.340
 friends that most of them do not 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.350
 like games from facebook or 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.820
 he simply prefers to avoid them and then what 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.040
 they take as spam until you can 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.950
 get to delete friends and send them 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.930
 requests for games that sometimes 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.569
 it's a bit annoying not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.099
 or that my recommendation is that no no 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.109
 try to buy this temple that is 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.909
 very complicated the truth is very 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.709
 hard 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.230
 for how little they'll give class 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.060
 a dragon my recommendation is that I do not 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.639
 complete in better now save well your 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.889
 gems or your food good if you 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:42.129
 they follow a goat of gems and a lot of food 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.500
 then completing without excuse work and if 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.719
 no, well, do not avoid being what is 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.590
 too much what a script asks you to 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:52.720
 food the necklaces that are cousins ​​the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.220
 we have to send you an invitation 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.919
 of the game a friend and he has to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.989
 accept yes no no if you do not give us the necklace 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.939
 for which I see it very difficult to 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.020
 true so my recommendation is that 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.360
 they do not understand it ok 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.550
 and then that would be all in conclusion already 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.700
 Do you know any questions that you have 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.610
 private message that always context 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.460
 and then to me then to remember it jarsún 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.990
 lay a comment of favorite nerves 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.760
 I am courageous and we have dared 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.760
 to god and take care
