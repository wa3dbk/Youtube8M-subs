I<00:05:20.650> figure<00:05:21.650> condemn<00:05:22.070> can<00:05:22.610> definitely<00:05:22.970> work

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
I figure condemn can definitely work

with<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.419> so<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:24.020> mean<00:05:24.199> you<00:05:24.800> got<00:05:24.919> a<00:05:24.949> 1515<00:05:25.580> coming

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
with it so I mean you got a 1515 coming

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.060 
with it so I mean you got a 1515 coming
at<00:05:25.909> you<00:05:26.060> can<00:05:26.360> either<00:05:26.509> give<00:05:27.320> them<00:05:27.440> 15<00:05:27.740> life<00:05:27.919> or

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
at you can either give them 15 life or

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.300 
at you can either give them 15 life or
you<00:05:28.159> can<00:05:28.280> die<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:29.050> condemn<00:05:30.050> like<00:05:31.039> I<00:05:31.070> said

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310
