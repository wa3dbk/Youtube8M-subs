why the heck would I be talking about

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.670

bromelain on a water website because

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.289 
bromelain on a water website because
they<00:00:04.799> both<00:00:05.009> have<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.460> do<00:00:05.609> with<00:00:05.640> reducing

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299

would be great set joke for sure but the
