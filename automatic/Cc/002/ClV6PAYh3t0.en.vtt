00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
microfiber and the mirror can be less

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.250 
microfiber and the mirror can be less
trickery<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.129> shiny<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

enviro<00:00:43.770> cloth<00:00:43.920> I've<00:00:44.520> already<00:00:44.730> gotten<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.270> wet

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
enviro cloth I've already gotten it wet

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
enviro cloth I've already gotten it wet
and<00:00:45.750> run<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.890> damp<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> I'm

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and run it out so it's damp and I'm

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.450 
and run it out so it's damp and I'm
going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> fold<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> into<00:00:48.510> fourth<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.309> keep<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
going to fold it into fourth and keep it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.920 
going to fold it into fourth and keep it
flat<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.030> i<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.210> take<00:00:51.360> advantage<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
flat so i can take advantage of all that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
flat so i can take advantage of all that
surface<00:00:52.469> area<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.579> i'll<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.760> take<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.239> mirror

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

and I'm going to wipe it with the class
and<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> flip<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> clean<00:00:57.840> side<00:00:58.609> one<00:00:59.609> more

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and I can flip to a clean side one more

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
and I can flip to a clean side one more

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
demo I'm going to show is how we can

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.749 
demo I'm going to show is how we can
just<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> drive<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> fact<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.610> we

norwex microfiber and be confident that
it's<00:01:26.640> cleaning<00:01:26.970> effectively<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.710> going

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to take one of these it's a medical

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280 
to take one of these it's a medical
grade<00:01:40.950> protein<00:01:41.549> test<00:01:41.880> log<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.659> simply<00:01:42.960> test

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
grade protein test log it's simply test

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
grade protein test log it's simply test
for<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.590> presence<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:44.220> protein<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
for the presence of protein and this

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:56.950 
for the presence of protein and this
being<00:01:45.689> ratchet<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.500> should<00:01:46.740> find<00:01:47.040> some

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.580 

and<00:01:57.500> get<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.830> little<00:01:58.100> shake<00:01:58.340> here<00:01:59.590> and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
and get a little shake here and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.080 
and get a little shake here and
sometimes<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.159> takes<00:02:01.310> disseminate<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.030> you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
sometimes it takes disseminate but you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.260 
sometimes it takes disseminate but you
can<00:02:02.270> see<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.540> starting<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.930> turn<00:02:03.110> purple

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
can see it's starting to turn purple

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.240 
can see it's starting to turn purple
there<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.330> goes<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.510> little<00:02:05.720> more<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.250> purple

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
there it goes a little more and purple

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.910 
there it goes a little more and purple
means<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.760> protein<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.360> present<00:02:09.050> which<00:02:09.740> is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
means that protein is present which is

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.750 
means that protein is present which is
no<00:02:10.069> surprise<00:02:10.250> right<00:02:10.729> that's<00:02:11.000> ratchet<00:02:11.680> ok<00:02:12.760> now

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
no surprise right that's ratchet ok now

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.250 
no surprise right that's ratchet ok now
I'm<00:02:13.880> going<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.090> take<00:02:14.180> my<00:02:14.360> entire<00:02:14.600> class<00:02:14.840> again

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
I'm going to take my entire class again

I'm going to take my entire class again
I'm<00:02:15.380> keeping<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.830> folded<00:02:16.280> flat<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.970> take

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
I'm keeping it folded flat to take

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.699 
I'm keeping it folded flat to take
advantage<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.720> surface<00:02:18.200> area<00:02:18.470> and

and I'm going to take a new medical

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.479 
and I'm going to take a new medical
grade<00:02:24.890> protein<00:02:25.430> test<00:02:25.700> web<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:27.250> just<00:02:28.250> slide

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
grade protein test web and just slide

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:37.920 
grade protein test web and just slide
that<00:02:28.520> same<00:02:28.970> area

did<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.269> get<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> chicken<00:02:46.840> juice<00:02:47.019> up<00:02:47.609> and

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
did to get the chicken juice up and

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.880 
did to get the chicken juice up and
here's<00:02:48.819> one<00:02:49.030> after<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.870> purple<00:02:50.260> means<00:02:50.409> protein

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
here's one after so purple means protein

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.390 
here's one after so purple means protein

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.160 
into the cloth and all that surface area
that<00:03:06.310> draws<00:03:06.609> them<00:03:06.879> up<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.930> have<00:03:08.019> any
