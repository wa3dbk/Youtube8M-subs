wind below the trafficking this is
something<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.940> studying<00:00:48.150> we<00:00:48.540> are<00:00:48.629> trying

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
something we are studying we are trying

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.689 
something we are studying we are trying
to<00:00:48.930> figure<00:00:49.199> out<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> effect<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> fuel

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
to figure out what the effect of fuel

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.270 
to figure out what the effect of fuel
economy<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.620> plan<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.040> be

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
economy is this is not plan to be

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
economy is this is not plan to be
released<00:00:53.580> anytime<00:00:53.760> soon<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
released anytime soon but that is

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.079 
released anytime soon but that is
something<00:00:55.379> which<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:56.280> reconsider<00:00:56.910> going

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
something which we see reconsider going

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.110 
something which we see reconsider going
forward<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:58.800> there<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.070> aspects<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
forward but there are other aspects of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.590 
forward but there are other aspects of
it<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.839> example<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:02.180> side<00:01:03.180> skirts

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it like for example the side skirts

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.530 
it like for example the side skirts
which<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.350> down<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.940> side<00:01:06.180> skirts

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
which you see down here the side skirts

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.130 
which you see down here the side skirts
these<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.350> already<00:01:07.670> serious<00:01:09.140> production

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
these are already serious production

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.830 
these are already serious production
parts<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.399> they<00:01:11.430> will<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.850> available<00:01:12.149> actually

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
parts so they will be available actually

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.529 
parts so they will be available actually
latest<00:01:13.710> end<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> year<00:01:14.550> as<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> serious

product in Cascadia because we know this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.180 
product in Cascadia because we know this
is<00:01:17.880> your<00:01:18.000> pantages<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:20.100> viewers

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
is your pantages for the viewers

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.980 
is your pantages for the viewers
for<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.790> aerodynamics<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.360> so<00:01:22.510> in<00:01:22.630> terms<00:01:22.810> of

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
for the aerodynamics and so in terms of

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.590 
for the aerodynamics and so in terms of
fuel<00:01:23.230> economy<00:01:23.590> slight<00:01:24.340> advantage<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.300> on

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
fuel economy slight advantage on the on

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.540 
fuel economy slight advantage on the on
the<00:01:25.630> aerodynamics<00:01:26.380> which<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.590> don't<00:01:26.650> want<00:01:26.980> to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
the aerodynamics which I don't want to

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.940 
the aerodynamics which I don't want to
burn<00:01:27.700> out<00:01:27.730> right<00:01:28.000> now<00:01:28.180> but<00:01:28.570> let<00:01:29.170> me<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:29.590> talk

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
burn out right now but let me just talk

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.920 
burn out right now but let me just talk
a<00:01:30.010> little<00:01:30.220> bit<00:01:30.400> about<00:01:30.550> these<00:01:30.790> we<00:01:31.690> have<00:01:31.810> your

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
a little bit about these we have your

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.160 
a little bit about these we have your
rear<00:01:32.500> view<00:01:32.680> mirrors<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:34.420> we<00:01:34.480> have<00:01:34.720> replaced

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
rear view mirrors now we have replaced

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.920 
rear view mirrors now we have replaced
the<00:01:35.440> mirrors<00:01:36.390> entirely<00:01:37.390> by<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.200> camera<00:01:38.650> system

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the mirrors entirely by a camera system

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.820 
the mirrors entirely by a camera system
the<00:01:40.500> camera<00:01:40.830> systems<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.850> displays<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
the camera systems actually displays the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.700 
the camera systems actually displays the
rear<00:01:44.040> view<00:01:44.130> left<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
rear view left and right and from the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.690 
rear view left and right and from the
steering<00:01:47.400> wheel<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.800> big<00:01:49.800> screens<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
steering wheel on big screens so you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.610 
steering wheel on big screens so you
have<00:01:51.150> always<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:51.930> clear<00:01:52.260> picture<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
have always a very clear picture of

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.230 
have always a very clear picture of
what's<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.310> behind<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.860> like<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.010> it

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
what's going on behind and like in it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.510 
what's going on behind and like in it
okay<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.960> very<00:01:58.020> functional<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
okay and that's a very functional and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.750 
okay and that's a very functional and
very<00:01:59.670> efficient<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.360> doing<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:01.460> not<00:02:02.460> least

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
very efficient way of doing it not least

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.190 
very efficient way of doing it not least
actually<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> aerodynamically

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.450 

advantage<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.340> getting<00:02:08.550> rid<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.360> mirror

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
advantage of getting rid of the mirror

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.180 
advantage of getting rid of the mirror
now<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.210> is<00:02:11.530> specifically<00:02:12.530> one<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.830> those

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
now this is specifically one of those

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.520 
now this is specifically one of those
innovations<00:02:14.120> where<00:02:14.570> we<00:02:14.720> want<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.320> get<00:02:15.470> our

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
innovations where we want to get our

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.059 
innovations where we want to get our
customer<00:02:16.100> input

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
customer input

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.960 
customer input
these<00:02:17.459> are<00:02:17.640> fully<00:02:17.939> functional

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
these are fully functional

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.030 
these are fully functional
we<00:02:19.510> want<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.840> know<00:02:20.020> whether<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.590> customers

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
we want to know whether the customers

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.810 
we want to know whether the customers
are<00:02:21.340> willing<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.300> go<00:02:22.450> down<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.810> road<00:02:23.820> whether

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
are willing to go down this road whether

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
are willing to go down this road whether
they<00:02:25.000> want<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:26.940> follow<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.210> path<00:02:28.480> of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
they want to follow this path of

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.170
