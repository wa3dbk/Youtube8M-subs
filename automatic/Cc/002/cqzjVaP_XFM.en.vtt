one<00:00:41.370> video<00:00:41.730> per<00:00:41.790> day<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.280> been

from number onwards I slowed down a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.690 
from number onwards I slowed down a
little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.280> most<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> days<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
little bit because most of the days I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.160 
little bit because most of the days I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and that was kind of hectic and I do

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
and that was kind of hectic and I do
this<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.180> enjoy<00:00:57.719> doing<00:00:57.989> it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
can also produce a video by looking at a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.170 
can also produce a video by looking at a
phone<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.560> about<00:02:10.709> 20<00:02:11.039> minutes<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.970> gather

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
phone for about 20 minutes I can gather

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.150 
phone for about 20 minutes I can gather
90%<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> points<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
90% of the points what the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.130 
90% of the points what the
does<00:02:14.400> or<00:02:14.580> not<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> give<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
does or not but I want to give a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.530 
does or not but I want to give a
complete<00:02:16.740> review<00:02:17.370> after<00:02:17.730> testing<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.300> product

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
complete review after testing a product

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.080 
complete review after testing a product
hence<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.350> take<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.710> lot<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> time<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.700> most<00:02:20.970> of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
hence I take a lot of time for most of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030 
hence I take a lot of time for most of
the<00:02:21.180> phones<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.570> generally<00:02:22.140> take<00:02:22.500> about<00:02:22.800> four

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the phones I generally take about four

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.280 
the phones I generally take about four
five<00:02:23.220> days<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> week<00:02:23.790> but<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.600> some<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
five days to a week but for some of the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.620 
five days to a week but for some of the
devices<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.310> feel<00:02:26.700> are<00:02:26.910> important

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
devices that I feel are important

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.570 
devices that I feel are important
I<00:02:27.660> generally<00:02:28.260> test<00:02:28.680> them<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:29.010> about<00:02:29.130> three<00:02:29.550> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
I generally test them for about three to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.810 
I generally test them for about three to
four<00:02:30.000> weeks<00:02:30.240> for<00:02:30.510> example<00:02:31.410> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.130> recall<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
four weeks for example if you recall the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.120 
four weeks for example if you recall the
Samsung<00:02:33.180> Galaxy<00:02:33.300> s4<00:02:33.780> when<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:34.860> launched

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
Samsung Galaxy s4 when it was launched

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.160 
Samsung Galaxy s4 when it was launched
every<00:02:35.610> reviewer<00:02:35.940> out<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:36.330> was<00:02:36.630> praising<00:02:37.050> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
every reviewer out there was praising it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.560 
every reviewer out there was praising it
like<00:02:37.350> crazy<00:02:37.710> but<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.550> used<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.060> phone<00:02:39.300> for

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
like crazy but I used that phone for

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.690 
like crazy but I used that phone for
over<00:02:39.990> 30<00:02:40.320> days<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.830> if<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.130> recall<00:02:41.460> I
