idea<00:01:27.680> triple<00:01:28.680> triple<00:01:29.160> necrovalley<00:01:29.550> because

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
idea triple triple necrovalley because

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.460 
idea triple triple necrovalley because
raikou<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> problem<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.260> back<00:01:34.260> goes<00:01:34.410> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
raikou is a problem and back goes a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.390 
raikou is a problem and back goes a
problem<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.190> use<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:37.040> nothing<00:01:38.040> really<00:01:38.070> else

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
problem so use that nothing really else

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.260 
problem so use that nothing really else
say<00:01:38.550> about<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> smells<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:39.480> standard<00:01:41.270> um

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
say about the smells are all standard um

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.230 
say about the smells are all standard um
yeah<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.620> guess<00:01:43.980> these<00:01:44.190> right<00:01:44.550> here<00:01:44.580> kind<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
yeah so I guess these right here kind of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.000 
yeah so I guess these right here kind of
kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.690> big<00:01:45.930> ones<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.500> to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
kind of be the big ones the to

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.290 
kind of be the big ones the to
compulsively<00:01:48.000> reread<00:01:48.450> over<00:01:48.930> bottomless<00:01:50.300> and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
compulsively reread over bottomless and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.410 
compulsively reread over bottomless and
I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.020> did<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.610> can

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
I think we did that because this can

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050 
I think we did that because this can
this<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:54.900> can<00:01:55.050> use<00:01:55.080> in<00:01:55.560> response<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.250> double

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
this you can use in response to double

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.350 
this you can use in response to double

underrated match and yeah that's really
good<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.509> then<00:04:36.660> down<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:37.160> these<00:04:38.160> cards

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
good and then down here these cards

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.520 
good and then down here these cards
right<00:04:38.580> here<00:04:38.880> these<00:04:39.630> are<00:04:39.690> basically<00:04:40.110> cards

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
right here these are basically cards

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.180 
right here these are basically cards
that<00:04:40.800> i<00:04:41.009> have<00:04:41.759> already<00:04:41.970> switched<00:04:42.479> in<00:04:43.190> so

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
that i have already switched in so

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.939 
that i have already switched in so
basically<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.940> paki<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.780> kind<00:04:46.259> of<00:04:46.320> overbooked

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
basically the paki I kind of overbooked

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.710 
basically the paki I kind of overbooked
I<00:04:47.099> guess<00:04:47.310> it's<00:04:47.550> basically<00:04:48.090> shuts<00:04:48.360> down<00:04:48.479> for

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
I guess it's basically shuts down for

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.260 
I guess it's basically shuts down for
our<00:04:48.750> monarchs<00:04:49.289> and<00:04:50.180> six<00:04:51.180> Sam's<00:04:51.389> completely<00:04:52.020> so

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
our monarchs and six Sam's completely so

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.790 
our monarchs and six Sam's completely so
I'm<00:04:54.270> going<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.539> take<00:04:54.690> out<00:04:54.900> one<00:04:55.199> prohibition

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
I'm going to take out one prohibition

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.640 
I'm going to take out one prohibition
and<00:04:55.889> one<00:04:56.009> goes<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.250> match<00:04:56.520> for<00:04:57.150> those<00:04:57.449> and<00:04:57.870> then

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
and one goes a match for those and then

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.430 
and one goes a match for those and then
the<00:04:58.800> point<00:04:58.919> of<00:04:59.099> rugs<00:04:59.280> out<00:04:59.430> here<00:04:59.729> because<00:05:00.440> two

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
the point of rugs out here because two

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.290 
the point of rugs out here because two
of<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.650> top<00:05:01.800> eight<00:05:02.009> decks<00:05:02.250> for<00:05:02.490> frog<00:05:02.820> monarchs

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
of the top eight decks for frog monarchs

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.640 
of the top eight decks for frog monarchs
and<00:05:03.539> I<00:05:03.660> was<00:05:03.780> fortunate<00:05:04.020> enough<00:05:04.169> not<00:05:04.349> to<00:05:04.620> have

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
and I was fortunate enough not to have

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.060 
and I was fortunate enough not to have
to<00:05:04.800> play<00:05:05.070> them<00:05:05.900> but<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.440> is<00:05:07.590> really<00:05:07.740> good<00:05:07.949> for

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
to play them but this is really good for

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.770 
to play them but this is really good for
our<00:05:08.280> monarchs<00:05:08.639> basically<00:05:09.210> until<00:05:09.510> they<00:05:09.630> drop

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
our monarchs basically until they drop

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.339 
our monarchs basically until they drop
Mobius<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:10.440> obvious<00:05:11.070> is<00:05:11.190> huge<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:12.330> when<00:05:13.199> the

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
Mobius and obvious is huge so when the

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.350 
Mobius and obvious is huge so when the
race<00:05:13.770> if<00:05:13.949> we<00:05:14.070> takes<00:05:14.310> care<00:05:14.610> of<00:05:14.639> that<00:05:14.729> so<00:05:15.090> I'm

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
race if we takes care of that so I'm

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.900 
race if we takes care of that so I'm
going<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.510> try<00:05:15.720> those<00:05:15.870> out

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
going to try those out

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.460 
going to try those out
over<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.630> rivalries<00:05:18.080> we'll<00:05:18.200> see<00:05:18.290> how<00:05:18.380> it<00:05:18.410> goes

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
over the rivalries we'll see how it goes

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.050 
over the rivalries we'll see how it goes
and<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:18.980> think<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.310> pakis<00:05:19.670> will<00:05:19.760> be<00:05:19.880> really

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
and I think the pakis will be really

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.660 
and I think the pakis will be really
good<00:05:21.160> so<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.580> guess<00:05:23.390> that's<00:05:23.570> really<00:05:24.380> about<00:05:25.220> it

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
good so I guess that's really about it

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.960 
good so I guess that's really about it
