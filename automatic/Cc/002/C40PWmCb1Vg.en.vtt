things<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.980> early<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.879> my

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
things really early just to get my

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.760 
things really early just to get my
opinions<00:00:48.930> across<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.379> these<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.649> all
