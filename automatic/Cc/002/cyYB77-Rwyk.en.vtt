00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 I ordered immediately 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.870

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.370

 This earth do you think how much 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.710
 How much do you think 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.280
 It's like I'm depressed . Trump sounds like a single item big card 600 yen and 500 yen. 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.680
 And

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:07.539
 The other is that the shape of the box is different from Hercot, but the pattern is 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.800
 Two for six at 22 each one for 2,200 yen 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.800

 There were some unusual cards that were sold or something unusual from the rampant discount plan. 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.040
 Information exchange of school cards by the school 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.730
 Such easy playing cards are still selling somewhere 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.630
