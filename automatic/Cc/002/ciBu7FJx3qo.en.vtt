here I think was thirteen dollars so not

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
here I think was thirteen dollars so not
a<00:01:29.820> bit<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.900> these<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.020> ten<00:01:31.259> bucks<00:01:31.439> with

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
a bit I think these are ten bucks with

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.810 
a bit I think these are ten bucks with
biogen<00:01:32.280> 13<00:01:33.030> bucks<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.229> bad<00:01:34.409> because

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
biogen 13 bucks not very bad because

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
biogen 13 bucks not very bad because
compared<00:01:35.820> process<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.420> other<00:01:36.600> places

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
compared process with other places

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.620 
compared process with other places
before<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.500> bottom<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> cheapest

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
before I bottom and this was a cheapest

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
before I bottom and this was a cheapest
so<00:01:40.130> can't<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.189> beat<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.759> know<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
so can't really beat it you know and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
so can't really beat it you know and
then<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> five<00:01:43.530> percent<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.430> i

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
then you get the five percent off so i

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
then you get the five percent off so i
think<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.450> 50<00:01:45.780> cents<00:01:46.170> off<00:01:46.470> ten

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
think that was like 50 cents off ten

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.389 
think that was like 50 cents off ten
dollars<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> fifty<00:01:49.619> five

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
dollars so you don't get the fifty five

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.270 
dollars so you don't get the fifty five
percent<00:01:50.430> off<00:01:50.850> shipping<00:01:51.290> but<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.560> mean<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.189> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
percent off shipping but I mean it's a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.240 
percent off shipping but I mean it's a
great<00:01:53.399> site<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.270> use<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.250> always
