00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.650 
blue skies you can still kind of see it
over<00:00:10.530> there<00:00:10.610> sunny<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.700> blue<00:00:11.969> sky<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.330> about

over there sunny and blue sky is about
10<00:00:13.049> minutes<00:00:13.259> ago

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:32.010 

no<00:00:21.600> not<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.170> much

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.930 

the<00:00:32.590> funny<00:00:32.800> part<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.220> I<00:00:33.370> made<00:00:33.580> it<00:00:33.700> all<00:00:33.790> the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
the funny part is that I made it all the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.060 
the funny part is that I made it all the
way<00:00:33.970> down<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.360> station<00:00:34.630> and<00:00:35.020> then<00:00:35.680> as<00:00:35.890> I

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
way down to the station and then as I

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.710 
way down to the station and then as I
was<00:00:36.190> waiting<00:00:36.460> for<00:00:36.490> the<00:00:36.670> bus<00:00:36.820> which<00:00:37.060> is<00:00:37.210> right

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
was waiting for the bus which is right

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.680 
was waiting for the bus which is right
there<00:00:37.750> right<00:00:38.230> now<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.710> bus<00:00:38.860> is<00:00:39.070> pulling<00:00:39.220> away

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
there right now the bus is pulling away

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.220 
there right now the bus is pulling away
this<00:00:40.690> started<00:00:41.200> so<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.130> was<00:00:42.430> like<00:00:42.610> I<00:00:42.880> called<00:00:43.480> and

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
this started so I was like I called and

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
this started so I was like I called and
I<00:00:44.290> was<00:00:44.410> like<00:00:44.530> I'm<00:00:44.739> not<00:00:45.489> going<00:00:45.910> hiking<00:00:46.090> today

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.110 

downside<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.769> now<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.910> wait

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
downside is now that I have to wait

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.080 
downside is now that I have to wait
about<00:00:51.899> an<00:00:52.140> hour<00:00:52.320> until<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.010> next<00:00:53.430> train<00:00:53.730> comes

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
about an hour until the next train comes

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
about an hour until the next train comes
to<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.070> back<00:00:56.719> but<00:00:57.719> um<00:00:58.789> at

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to go the other way to go back but um at

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.829 
to go the other way to go back but um at
least<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.659> watch<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:01.500> listen<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
least I have this to watch and listen to

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:10.180 
least I have this to watch and listen to
Wow

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.190 

why<00:01:11.190> hello<00:01:12.530> literally<00:01:13.530> 10<00:01:14.490> minutes<00:01:15.000> later

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.140 

still<00:01:19.200> raining<00:01:19.620> but<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.760> not<00:01:20.910> gonna<00:01:21.060> be

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
still raining but it's not gonna be

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.920 
still raining but it's not gonna be
raining<00:01:21.360> there

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.300 

I'm<00:01:26.930> still<00:01:27.200> not<00:01:27.290> gonna<00:01:27.439> go<00:01:27.649> hiking<00:01:27.890> because

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
I'm still not gonna go hiking because

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.770 
I'm still not gonna go hiking because
it's<00:01:28.460> been<00:01:28.579> doing<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.030> on<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.420> off<00:01:29.540> thing

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
it's been doing this on and off thing

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.069 
it's been doing this on and off thing
all<00:01:30.619> morning<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.369> I'm<00:01:31.700> assuming<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.750> probably

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
all morning and I'm assuming is probably

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.100 
all morning and I'm assuming is probably
just<00:01:33.200> going<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.470> keep<00:01:33.649> happening<00:01:34.930> but<00:01:35.930> that's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
just going to keep happening but that's

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.279 
just going to keep happening but that's
a<00:01:36.409> pretty<00:01:36.590> interesting<00:01:37.600> thing<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:38.750> got<00:01:38.930> going

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
a pretty interesting thing we got going

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:49.960 
a pretty interesting thing we got going
on<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:43.750> yeah<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.560> point<00:01:46.119> it's<00:01:47.119> been<00:01:48.970> reliably

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
on so yeah this point it's been reliably

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.389 
on so yeah this point it's been reliably
not<00:01:50.420> raining<00:01:50.750> for<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.229> bit<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:55.009> when<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.189> got

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
not raining for a bit and when I got

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.820 
not raining for a bit and when I got
back<00:01:56.320> from<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.209> station<00:01:59.319> and<00:02:00.319> I<00:02:00.409> got<00:02:00.560> back<00:02:00.709> to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
back from the station and I got back to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.460 
back from the station and I got back to
my<00:02:00.979> station<00:02:01.220> instead<00:02:02.149> of<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.509> usually<00:02:03.140> ride<00:02:03.350> my

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
my station instead of I usually ride my

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.969 
my station instead of I usually ride my
bike<00:02:03.679> to<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.819> station<00:02:05.530> instead<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.679> riding<00:02:06.830> my

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
bike to the station instead of riding my

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.370 
bike to the station instead of riding my
bike<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.670> sideways<00:02:08.660> rain<00:02:08.840> cuz<00:02:09.200> by<00:02:09.319> the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
bike in the sideways rain cuz by the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.340 
bike in the sideways rain cuz by the
time<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.610> back<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:11.090> my<00:02:11.120> station<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:12.230> was

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
time I get back to my station it was

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.890 
time I get back to my station it was
pouring<00:02:12.739> again<00:02:13.269> instead<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.330> riding<00:02:14.569> my<00:02:14.750> bike

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
pouring again instead of riding my bike

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.809 
pouring again instead of riding my bike
in<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.110> sideways<00:02:15.470> range<00:02:15.769> which<00:02:16.280> felt<00:02:16.580> really

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
in the sideways range which felt really

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.110 
in the sideways range which felt really
just<00:02:17.239> dangerous<00:02:17.830> guess<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.340> good<00:02:20.000> em

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
just dangerous guess I have to good em

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.180 
just dangerous guess I have to good em
pretty<00:02:20.269> like<00:02:20.510> narrow<00:02:20.840> paths<00:02:21.230> on<00:02:21.560> fairly<00:02:21.890> busy

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
pretty like narrow paths on fairly busy

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.940 
pretty like narrow paths on fairly busy
roads<00:02:22.569> did<00:02:23.569> not<00:02:23.720> want<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.930> get<00:02:24.049> blown<00:02:24.530> into<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
roads did not want to get blown into the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.910 
roads did not want to get blown into the
road<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.340> run<00:02:25.459> over<00:02:25.700> by<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:25.880> car<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:27.620> wanted

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920
