hi this is my tutorial on how to a my
black<00:00:03.240> widow<00:00:03.419> bonnet<00:00:03.840> slingshot<00:00:04.380> catapult

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.169 

firstly<00:00:10.370> personally<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.429> don't<00:00:11.519> know<00:00:11.759> what

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
firstly personally I don't know what

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.990 
firstly personally I don't know what
this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:13.219> some<00:00:14.219> people<00:00:14.549> say<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:14.849> you're

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
this is but some people say if you're

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.740 
this is but some people say if you're
right<00:00:15.179> handed<00:00:15.470> grip<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:17.420> catapult<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.600> your

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
right handed grip the catapult with your

left hand and draw a white hand but I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.140 
left hand and draw a white hand but I
think<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.710> find<00:00:22.980> easier<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.580> grip<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:24.060> your

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

not some people to say that and uh or
anyway<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.830> how<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.660> would<00:00:33.660> aim<00:00:33.930> a

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
anyway this is how I would aim a

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
anyway this is how I would aim a
catapult<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.960> for<00:00:36.960> instance<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.380> catapult

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
catapult or for instance this catapult

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.190 
catapult or for instance this catapult
I'd<00:00:39.000> look<00:00:39.620> straight<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> middle<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
I'd look straight up in the middle and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.920 
I'd look straight up in the middle and
across<00:00:43.200> from<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> top<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.910> forks<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
across from the top of the forks in the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.830 
across from the top of the forks in the
middle<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.690> mi<00:00:52.530> use

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
middle you know like the the mi use

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.590 
middle you know like the the mi use
steel<00:00:54.840> balls<00:00:55.610> for<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.730> small<00:00:57.149> game<00:00:57.360> for

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
steel balls for like small game for

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.209 
steel balls for like small game for
hunting<00:00:57.989> and<00:01:00.350> like<00:01:01.350> rabbits<00:01:01.890> squirrels

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
hunting and like rabbits squirrels

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:17.820 
hunting and like rabbits squirrels
pigeons<00:01:03.059> wherever<00:01:03.629> etc<00:01:04.700> pheasants

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.070 

on<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:19.130> already<00:01:19.790> taking<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.330> shot<00:01:20.540> but<00:01:20.780> let's

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
on this already taking a shot but let's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.080 
on this already taking a shot but let's
just<00:01:22.010> say<00:01:22.600> I've<00:01:23.600> drawn<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:25.090> small<00:01:26.409> circle<00:01:28.090> like

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
just say I've drawn a small circle like

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.270 
just say I've drawn a small circle like
that<00:01:29.299> would<00:01:29.570> definitely<00:01:30.049> kill<00:01:30.350> some<00:01:30.979> game

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
that would definitely kill some game

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:45.789 
that would definitely kill some game
head<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.640> can<00:01:40.850> get<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:42.290> ball<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:44.799> circle

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
head you can get the ball in that circle

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.060 
head you can get the ball in that circle
then<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.690> definitely<00:01:47.690> have<00:01:47.960> neck<00:01:48.290> shot<00:01:48.799> and

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
then you definitely have neck shot and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.340 
then you definitely have neck shot and
this<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:49.520> how<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.670> would<00:01:50.030> do<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.300> by<00:01:50.810> looking<00:01:50.990> for

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
this is how I would do it by looking for

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:06.899 
this is how I would do it by looking for
the<00:01:51.440> middle<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:53.570> going<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.810> demonstrate<00:01:53.990> it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.150 

see<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:07.940> wasn't<00:02:08.239> close<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.959> was<00:02:09.470> close<00:02:09.769> but<00:02:10.630> this

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
see I wasn't close I was close but this

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:27.490 
see I wasn't close I was close but this
went<00:02:13.160> for<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:26.120> just<00:02:26.420> missed<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:26.989> I'm<00:02:27.140> not

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
went for it I just missed so I'm not

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.180 
went for it I just missed so I'm not
that<00:02:27.680> curat<00:02:28.070> with<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.310> yet<00:02:28.570> mighty<00:02:29.570> beginner

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
that curat with it yet mighty beginner

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.120 
that curat with it yet mighty beginner
but<00:02:31.660> from<00:02:32.660> videos<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.380> I've<00:02:33.470> watched<00:02:33.739> on<00:02:33.950> how

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
but from videos that I've watched on how

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.370 
but from videos that I've watched on how
to<00:02:35.829> aim<00:02:36.829> these<00:02:37.220> things<00:02:38.110> doesn't<00:02:39.110> really

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
to aim these things doesn't really

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.380 
to aim these things doesn't really
explain<00:02:39.799> that<00:02:40.130> much<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.850> most<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.239> them

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
explain that much on most of them

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.550 
explain that much on most of them
because<00:02:41.540> there's<00:02:41.720> not<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.870> much<00:02:42.140> videos

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
because there's not that much videos

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.400 
because there's not that much videos
