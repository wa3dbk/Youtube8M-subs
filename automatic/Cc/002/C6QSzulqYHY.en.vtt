00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
little bit I'm going to take out a

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.650 
little bit I'm going to take out a
little<00:01:48.760> bit<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.060> bass<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:51.300> fair<00:01:52.300> bit<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.479> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.860

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:43.210 
treble to the three o'clock position
this<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.880> more<00:02:27.060> suitable<00:02:27.240> for<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> slap<00:02:28.020> sound

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.500 

so<00:02:44.220> next<00:02:44.400> up<00:02:44.550> we're<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:44.880> going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.120> dial<00:02:45.360> in

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
so next up we're just going to dial in

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.900 
so next up we're just going to dial in
the<00:02:45.600> amplifier<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.410> one<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.370> my<00:02:47.490> favorite

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the amplifier to one of my favorite

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.000 
the amplifier to one of my favorite
sounds<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.990> little<00:02:49.230> bit<00:02:49.320> more<00:02:49.530> bass<00:02:49.740> heavy

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
sounds it's a little bit more bass heavy

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.150 
sounds it's a little bit more bass heavy
because<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.520> like<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> smooth<00:02:51.030> deep<00:02:51.300> bass<00:02:51.540> and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
because I like a smooth deep bass and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:28.229 
because I like a smooth deep bass and
let's<00:02:53.160> have<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.310> listen<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.640> how<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.820> sounds

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.750 

so<00:03:29.239> there<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:29.840> BP<00:03:30.410> 20<00:03:30.770> great<00:03:31.520> little

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
so there it is the BP 20 great little

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.910 
so there it is the BP 20 great little
