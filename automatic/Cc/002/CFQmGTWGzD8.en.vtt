00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.569 
charging it all the way is what you want
to<00:02:26.659> do<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.829> you<00:02:27.950> charged<00:02:28.219> all<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.459> way

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
to do is have you charged all the way

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.630 
to do is have you charged all the way
the<00:02:29.480> first<00:02:29.689> like<00:02:29.959> time<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.590> time<00:02:30.980> or<00:02:31.220> two<00:02:31.430> that

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
the first like time a time or two that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.160 
the first like time a time or two that
you<00:02:31.879> can<00:02:32.030> possibly<00:02:32.269> do<00:02:32.629> so<00:02:32.810> without<00:02:32.930> having

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
you can possibly do so without having

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.710 
you can possibly do so without having
effective<00:02:33.620> gig<00:02:33.849> let<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.939> battery<00:02:35.239> drain<00:02:35.480> all

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
effective gig let the battery drain all

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.420 
effective gig let the battery drain all
the<00:02:35.870> way<00:02:35.989> out<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.379> then<00:02:36.709> recharge<00:02:37.069> with<00:02:37.250> all

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
the way out and then recharge with all

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.309 
the way out and then recharge with all
the<00:02:37.549> way<00:02:37.609> to<00:02:37.670> fool<00:02:37.909> like<00:02:38.389> a<00:02:38.629> couple<00:02:39.049> of<00:02:39.139> times

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
the way to fool like a couple of times

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.589 
the way to fool like a couple of times
and<00:02:39.620> by<00:02:39.799> doing<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.129> you're<00:02:40.939> going<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.180> allow

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
and by doing that you're going to allow

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.210 
and by doing that you're going to allow
the<00:02:41.629> battery<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:44.569> actually<00:02:44.959> last<00:02:45.200> longer<00:02:45.829> when

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
the battery to actually last longer when

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.619 
the battery to actually last longer when
I<00:02:46.250> say<00:02:46.430> longer<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.790> mean<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.329> like<00:02:47.359> you<00:02:47.599> know

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
I say longer I mean for like you know

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.960 
I say longer I mean for like you know
like<00:02:48.200> months<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.099> months<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.459> years<00:02:49.549> longer

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
like months and months and years longer

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.629 
like months and months and years longer
as<00:02:50.269> far<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.840> know<00:02:51.189> we'd<00:02:52.189> have<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.400> replace

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
as far as you know we'd have to replace

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.229 
as far as you know we'd have to replace
the<00:02:52.819> battery<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:54.049> that's<00:02:55.010> also<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> good<00:02:55.430> tip

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
the battery and that's also a good tip

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.640 
the battery and that's also a good tip
for<00:02:56.269> like<00:02:56.540> cell<00:02:56.780> phone

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
before you use it and I'll let them

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.369 
before you use it and I'll let them
drain<00:03:04.489> all<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.700> way<00:03:04.879> out<00:03:05.000> once<00:03:05.810> or<00:03:05.930> twice<00:03:06.049> and
