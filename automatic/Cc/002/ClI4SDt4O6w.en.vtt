00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:10.059
 hello guys how happy I am that another 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.249
 once again be here well read them 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.709
 dreams this time I bring you book 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.789
 that I liked very much as we imagine 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.530
 I already know that all the books that are 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.090
 save books that I liked because 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.150
 that talks to you reviews because really 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 I recommend it and if we stay like 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.650
 friends of elisabeth 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.170
 Boys and girls can be 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.440
 friends 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.620
 or always waiting for a fight of no 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.260
 to speak never or a kiss of 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.030
 find true love 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.399
 that is the question with which we 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.960
 we started in this story of the guys 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.300
 I do not know if the correct way to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.159
 pronounce it the name of it that is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.050
 marketing and I was reading all the 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.930
 story so I tried like that more law 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.610
 but I like more machine and this guy 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.039
 that does not appear on the cover this is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.379
 slight discrimination a boy who is 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.449
 friend of this girl here the question 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.549
 what I've done to them initially is the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.380
 dilemma also in this story I'm going 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.049
 to re-raise the question but of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.479
 a different perspective two guys that 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.240
 they seem to be made for each other 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.890
 that you both enjoy talking with 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.470
 the other one enjoys being with that person 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.350
 more than anything in the world although they have 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 a boyfriend a girlfriend prefer to be with 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.080
 that by friend can be really friends 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.869
 for example levin who wants to have it is 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.149
 very very pretty but for more laps than 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.860
 they are still enjoying hands being with 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.720
 her friends marketing that with their boyfriends 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.750
 obviously if their mothers are nothing 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.220
 kisses and all that but enjoys the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.790
 marketing company 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.500
 and on the marketing side she could not 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.340
 have a boyfriend in the beginning struggled a lot 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.470
 because he was always with his friend and 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.620
 everyone said is not the couple 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.530
 perfect so nobody gets better than the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.390
 Maca llanera is very beautiful many guys 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.940
 they liked it more than they no longer 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.240
 they dared to go and tell him hey come out with me 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.700
 because it 's from levy although free 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.619
 having assets but being sincere you 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.830
 you wanted in the place of one of those two 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.490
 guys remember that they are young they go in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.570
 secondary but they would really sacrifice 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.730
 a relationship of friendship so will 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.130
 as to try a government where 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.620
 know that high school sweethearts 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.510
 it really is very rare that they continue 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.760
 working after a while that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.850
 they are young and then there are different 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 new tastes change then the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.990
 colleges 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.780
 etcetera I think we would all stop 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.620
 to think about really I want to order 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.630
 This friendship is a super friendship where 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.180
 the family of the other is the family of one 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.940
 appointment if they are friends are and really 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.330
 I am very convinced that it was worth the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.790
 sorry to spend this money that I did not plan 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.060
 quite the story is written of 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.739
 a very peculiar way 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.090
 that if I think that if I tell them in 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.860
 this moment before they read the book 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.450
 they will understand much better at 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.280
 have help in your hands about to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.610
 law we start with a black sheet 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.410
 where a sentence is one of the two 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.200
 guys you have to choose to give yourself 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.970
 account of who is talking happy 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.590
 the boys and the girls against myths 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.390
 who is asking what does the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.040
 next sentence says well I like 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.690
 Levin straight to the point 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.090
 then you know that the first one was the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.849
 ibi and the second answer by 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.170
 emarketer then they start talking about 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.400
 vision speak they start to talk and they 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.970
 they finish the black sheet 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.230
 and then the real story begins 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.970
 chapter 1 is narrated from machicolation 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.370
 when the chapter is over again there are 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.920
 one sheet in black and the next 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.310
 chapter is narrated from the 'green 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.379
 that I loved going forward in the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.040
 story from the perspective of egg 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.799
 from another I love I'm in love with 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.659
 this from the first time I read or the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.030
 choice of abuse made me a little 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.290
 weird but I liked it too much and I 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.060
 I find this book that I did not think 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.709
 that it would be like that but 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.069
 but with these black leaves are the 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.780
 I swear I get to spend more than half of the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.120
 book and I still did not understand why those 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.130
 such strange conversations good at 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.049
 that I imagined was this is like 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.570
 the guys were telling us their 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.160
 history and between each chapter to 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.750
 beginning of each chapter they made a 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
 pause and they started doing 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.919
 comments like hey you remember 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.740
 this if you look like this fool or things 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.470
 well comments today x maybe but it gives 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.100
 a little more life to these characters 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.000
 It's time for the phrases 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.820
 it was done in silence 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.830
 it happened to us from time to time when you 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.470
 feel at ease with someone not 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.030
 you need to have all the sites if 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.210
 had only one goal in life 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.650
 would make her laugh daily without more 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.470
 the moment and people we finish the 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.600
 memory and with golds this is a book 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.190
 that I recommend it a lot very much 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.040
 especially if you like stories 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.900
 common corny do not forget that here I am going 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.590
 to leave my twitter 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.260

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.820
 on facebook and post to other networks 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.220
