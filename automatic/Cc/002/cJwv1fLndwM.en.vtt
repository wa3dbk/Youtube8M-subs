I had Botox and nutopia better I'm 36
years<00:00:18.660> old<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.290> I<00:00:19.439> started<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
years old and I started to see the

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.690 
years old and I started to see the
little<00:00:20.460> signs<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:21.500> aging<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.520> wanted

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
little signs of aging and I just wanted

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.210

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to have a more refreshed look I think is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.420 
to have a more refreshed look I think is
what<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> was<00:00:26.580> really<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.250> bit

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
what I was really going for a little bit

so just that volume in your face kind of

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.960
