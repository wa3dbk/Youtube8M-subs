00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
three patches already to that so they

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.330 
three patches already to that so they
decided<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> one

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
decided that they are you know the one

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.820 
decided that they are you know the one
turn<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> lot<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
turn this down a lot and make it in a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.920 
turn this down a lot and make it in a
bit<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.130> ledgy<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> guess<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.479> moving<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.780> once

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
bit more ledgy I guess so moving on once

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
bit more ledgy I guess so moving on once
again<00:01:13.229> they've<00:01:13.770> improved<00:01:14.100> smalley<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.640> death

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
wouldn't go and do a sort of race they

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.289 
wouldn't go and do a sort of race they
would<00:02:20.680> go<00:02:20.829> on<00:02:20.890> farm<00:02:21.129> a<00:02:21.189> mission<00:02:21.549> so<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.150> fact

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
would go on farm a mission so the fact

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.869 
would go on farm a mission so the fact
they've<00:02:22.420> actually<00:02:22.540> added<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:23.049> in<00:02:23.319> is

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879

around<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.760> Christmas<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.120> online<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.629> I

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
around to Christmas and online so I

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.970 
around to Christmas and online so I
thought<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.140> they<00:02:44.560> could<00:02:44.590> make<00:02:44.829> that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
thought that they could make that

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.430 
thought that they could make that
available<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:45.700> apparently<00:02:46.209> they<00:02:47.049> fixed<00:02:47.409> that

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
available but apparently they fixed that

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.649 
available but apparently they fixed that
it<00:02:48.069> also<00:02:48.280> fixed<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> ratio<00:02:49.150> where<00:02:49.329> characters

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
it also fixed a ratio where characters

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.390 
it also fixed a ratio where characters
could<00:02:49.959> be<00:02:50.049> lost<00:02:50.230> if<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.650> player<00:02:50.859> tempted<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
could be lost if the player tempted to

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.479

the network so that was an issue that

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.429 
the network so that was an issue that
some<00:02:56.620> people<00:02:56.889> having<00:02:57.280> says<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> rare<00:02:58.389> issue<00:02:58.629> how

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
some people having says a rare issue how

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.050 
some people having says a rare issue how
where<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.739> was<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.220> don't<00:03:00.730> really<00:03:00.819> know<00:03:00.970> I've

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
where it was I don't really know I've

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.580 
where it was I don't really know I've
never<00:03:01.209> had<00:03:01.389> that<00:03:01.420> problem<00:03:01.569> personally<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.530> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
never had that problem personally and I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.990 
never had that problem personally and I
haven't<00:03:02.889> heard<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.189> so<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.430> guess<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.849> must

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000
