00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
tutorial I said you get 100k in 10

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.320 
tutorial I said you get 100k in 10
minutes<00:05:25.560> well<00:05:26.129> I<00:05:26.370> could<00:05:26.789> not<00:05:27.029> be<00:05:27.210> in<00:05:27.270> favor

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
minutes well I could not be in favor

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.200 
minutes well I could not be in favor
away<00:05:27.870> from<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.169> truth<00:05:28.409> if<00:05:28.620> I<00:05:28.800> even<00:05:29.669> tried<00:05:29.940> guys

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
away from the truth if I even tried guys

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.170 
away from the truth if I even tried guys
you<00:05:30.629> get<00:05:30.840> absolutely<00:05:31.050> more<00:05:31.949> cuz<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.520> did<00:05:33.090> it

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
you get absolutely more cuz I did it

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.559 
you get absolutely more cuz I did it
today<00:05:33.449> and<00:05:33.659> I<00:05:33.719> got<00:05:33.750> about<00:05:34.759> 200<00:05:35.759> files<00:05:35.969> I<00:05:36.150> don't

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
today and I got about 200 files I don't

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.260 
today and I got about 200 files I don't
really<00:05:36.750> count<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.229> I<00:05:37.259> did<00:05:37.620> actually<00:05:37.830> get

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
really count but I did actually get

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.659 
really count but I did actually get
hundreds<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.330> thousands<00:05:39.930> in<00:05:40.529> less<00:05:41.310> than<00:05:41.460> 10

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
hundreds of thousands in less than 10

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.430 
hundreds of thousands in less than 10
minutes<00:05:41.930> so<00:05:42.930> if<00:05:43.020> you're<00:05:43.139> doing<00:05:43.319> it<00:05:43.409> correctly

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
minutes so if you're doing it correctly

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.999 
minutes so if you're doing it correctly
and<00:05:44.569> another<00:05:45.569> thing<00:05:45.690> what<00:05:46.349> you<00:05:46.409> want<00:05:46.650> to<00:05:46.740> do<00:05:46.860> is

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
and another thing what you want to do is

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.800 
and another thing what you want to do is
well<00:05:47.250> just<00:05:47.699> to<00:05:47.819> make<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.029> a<00:05:48.240> little<00:05:48.419> bit<00:05:48.659> better

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
well just to make it a little bit better

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.930 
well just to make it a little bit better
so<00:05:49.050> everyone's<00:05:49.409> getting<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:50.430> money<00:05:50.699> worth

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
so everyone's getting the money worth

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.300 
so everyone's getting the money worth
out<00:05:51.240> of<00:05:51.360> this<00:05:51.509> strategy<00:05:51.779> you<00:05:52.560> should<00:05:52.589> split<00:05:53.250> up

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
out of this strategy you should split up

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.430 
out of this strategy you should split up
a<00:05:53.520> tiny<00:05:53.909> little<00:05:54.150> bit<00:05:54.509> so<00:05:54.659> then<00:05:54.839> when<00:05:55.319> an

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
a tiny little bit so then when an

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.990 
a tiny little bit so then when an
armored<00:05:55.650> truck<00:05:55.680> spawns<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.430> closest<00:05:56.849> person

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
armored truck spawns the closest person

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.119 
armored truck spawns the closest person
gets<00:05:57.479> that<00:05:57.629> truck<00:05:57.930> wet<00:05:58.440> through<00:05:58.620> another<00:05:58.949> and

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
gets that truck wet through another and

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.589 
gets that truck wet through another and
then<00:05:59.400> the<00:05:59.520> closest<00:05:59.879> person<00:06:00.029> gets<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.449> other

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
then the closest person gets the other

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.170 
then the closest person gets the other
truck<00:06:00.839> so<00:06:01.289> on<00:06:01.469> so<00:06:01.740> then<00:06:01.889> all<00:06:02.129> of<00:06:02.430> you<00:06:02.699> guys<00:06:02.940> are

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
truck so on so then all of you guys are

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.640 
truck so on so then all of you guys are
actually<00:06:03.300> getting<00:06:03.659> money<00:06:03.900> from<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.229> strategy

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
actually getting money from the strategy

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.499 
actually getting money from the strategy
and<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:04.889> not<00:06:05.069> just<00:06:05.250> one<00:06:05.490> person<00:06:05.940> so

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
and it's not just one person so

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.390 
and it's not just one person so
hopefully<00:06:06.779> this<00:06:07.110> video<00:06:07.560> it<00:06:07.830> did<00:06:08.039> help<00:06:08.219> you
