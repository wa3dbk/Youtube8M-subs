00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 so my friends and welcome 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.220
 to a new tutorial of text and yes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
 that's the second day you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.620
 take that up because I will have it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.900
 again micro on last time with 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.140
 put out that we somehow completely 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.720
 picture not now but rather 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.300
 on the subject and today the transformer 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 high voltage middleware tate &amp; lyle old 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 eight of these three species are so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.649
 high voltage medium voltage small 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.820
 so make remedies that way 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.760
 Now that we have a little free 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.719
 who face mountains are everywhere 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.719
 solder does that I think 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.789
 There are three different types says so 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.469
 low voltage looks a bit like that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:00.469
 like dirt in the medium term and high 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:04.019
 voltage is that one recognizes already that 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:08.939
 that has something in common with 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.610
 the save so with red box mfp and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.040
 mfs rudi I have even seen here 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.320
 you already high voltage and that's why 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 because the types of tension are the ones 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.770
 spend 1 1 at a bed box one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.590
 small mountain box outputs low voltage 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:31.680
 a mfp medium voltage and nfs world 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.650
 age so this transformer takes here 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 now there is some tension in there 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.200
 this tension what they are so one 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.500
 match makes a tension something 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.810
 wanted to medium and for example if 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.119
 their high voltage comes through so 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.850
 here this input purely then gives the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.549
 medium voltage off and at high voltage 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 if something comes out or what 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.130
 smaller as well as medium then wants 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.130
 transformed that into 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.990
 gold is equally at low voltage triggers 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.369
 The problem here is that you have a low 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.140
 voltage only medium voltage so 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.750
 Medium gold beach can do at high 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.040
 voltage flies here in the air 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.140
 So you had to go high if you did 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.470
 voltage has only too medium voltage 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.250
 and then to low voltage and that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.989
 I show it now for a very short time 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.209
 if we now have a mfs uran with 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.190
 any memory and then 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.099
 for example, an electric from ace 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.480
 should drive so it still works 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.780
 but if I clean the first battery 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.769
 do what it just all goes 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.959
 book that is because that this 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.750
 it does not turn off high voltage 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.060
 devices give high voltage there are 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.950
 but also devices that can not do so 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.349
 that's why you have to have a smaller voltage 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.099
 but give so we have a mfs or 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.390
 high voltage 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.370
 that means I would have to first now 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.349
 this high voltage to medium voltage 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.940
 stop here the input is with 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.220
 the three holes the individual holes 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.109
 are out puts then i could be here now 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.600
 for example, give out and then here 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.620
 an oven rantum but still 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.660
 not because the only low voltage 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.950
 tolerate what again means I have to 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.200
 Now here again a low voltage 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.150
 Transform and tackle this medium 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.989
 bolt stops here nor material world to 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.910
 make and then I have here in the oven 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.690
 and I can get something in here 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:34.720
 Whatever it is 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:36.579
 does that work out there is the whole thing 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.440
 you can do it mid mid mid 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.239
 It does not always have to be glass fiber 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.389
 You can do that with the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.720
 here with four times to nate campbell or 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:50.690
 like that is called volt cable that is only for 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.940
 high voltage there do this with 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:59.810
 That might not work quite well 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:01.970
 if it was for him I would 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.860
 now 2 high voltage for example what 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.060
 less nobody actually cords that 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.050
 they do not explain but I show 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.210
 that again quite good 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.620
 you can see what the difference is 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.540
 between hype and medium i would now 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.090
 here for example one and two times into 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:22.840
 Take a cable or a copper cable 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:27.410
 then this would happen here 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.690
 nothing happens because of the memory 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.020
 his 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:37.250
 but that's only possible with that 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.900
 copper cable makes it even there 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.500
 I did not think I was 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.800
 I'm sorry for a bit 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.810
 you could say yes yes this one 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.820
 high voltage transform it stops only if 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.920
 because you want medium voltage or low 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.340
 that's what it's all about 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.140
 but rare that you need it 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.210
 but rather if you have higher energy in 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.710
 high voltage wants to make higher energy 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.650
 For example, that would be like that here 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.800
 an atomic reactor gives me energy out 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.540
 as a high voltage and that's why I 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.480
 you can even tackle more firmly 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.310
 I have a high voltage here 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.930
 transformer which is still nice here 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.190
 I'll show it for a very short while 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.850
 now times the atomic reactor looks 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.370
 something to it 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.640
 and if I care about this transformer 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.040
 which works with all switches 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.750
 and the exhibitor or instead of or 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.150
 then there is no energy left 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.550
 but she can not keep up 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.560
 As you can see , nothing is doing anymore 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.169
 I'll do that again 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.600
 the following so that was not the whole 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.400
 big to the transformer i hope 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.360
 you like it i hope you still 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.300
 helped a little bit further or 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.890
 those who deal with ticket 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.450
 want to argue and therefore 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.100
 I'll just say goodbye and now 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.100
 Until next time
