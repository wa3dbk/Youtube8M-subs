00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.710
 voiced specifically for greenty TV 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.139
 I am not sitting today one of the coldest 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.440
 days in korea 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.199
 12 degrees below zero if you are not yet 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.869
 knew the peak then I think that Korea is one 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 of the coldest places well, let's say that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.160
 you are from Siberia then you are worse in such 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.640
 Koreaâ€™s second place 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 otherwise, the winter wind blows from Siberia 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 so Korea and itself are practically similar 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.690
 and to prove to you how cold 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.590
 let me show you what i am wearing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.760
 hat scarf super warm winter jacket 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.760
 one of the warmest sweaters 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.680
 shirt t-shirt and my very warm 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.730
 a long-sleeved sweater is also not for us 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 jeans pajama pants warm ambassadors 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.430
 I honestly worry more about 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.229
 warmer 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.200
 than in appearance well and we have not yet 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.500
 coward and take my word for it and so I put on 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.350
 yourself 11 things well seriously if you 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 have already experienced -12 degrees you understand about 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.500
 than me 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.080
 right of course this is not going on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.619
 winter just happened that today alone 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.180
 of the coldest days in korea 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.229
 global warming messed up the weather in 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.540
 Korea and it drives me crazy and so they say 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 The essence of the story is that in Korea too 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.680
 can be very cold and to me from this 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.470
 bad then 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.810
 how cold is where you live 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.850
 think you can survive the korean 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 winter write your comments then 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.560
