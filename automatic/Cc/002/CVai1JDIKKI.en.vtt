00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
good way of doing it the farther we can

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
good way of doing it the farther we can
spread<00:01:11.369> teams<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> old<00:01:12.240> zone<00:01:12.479> the

the<00:01:18.060> decisions<00:01:18.540> he<00:01:18.689> makes<00:01:18.960> he's<00:01:19.290> basically

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the decisions he makes he's basically

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
the decisions he makes he's basically
thinking<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.240> guys<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:21.869> gonna<00:01:22.020> do

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
thinking what do guys think I'm gonna do

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.450 
thinking what do guys think I'm gonna do
with<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> puck<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.070> he<00:01:23.130> does<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
with the puck right now and he does the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
with the puck right now and he does the
opposite<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.049> makes<00:01:25.229> him

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
opposite of it and that's what makes him

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.789 
opposite of it and that's what makes him
so<00:01:25.950> creative<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:26.790> he's<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.799> guess

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so creative out there he's a I guess

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
so creative out there he's a I guess
he's<00:01:29.430> looking<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:29.909> Davey<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.780> he's<00:01:30.930> looking

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
he's looking at Davey and he's looking

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.600 
he's looking at Davey and he's looking
at<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> last<00:01:31.770> second<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.340> he'll<00:01:32.430> pass

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
at the last second and then he'll pass

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510 
at the last second and then he'll pass
it<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> me<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.710> when<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.799> play<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it to me and I think when you play that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.249 
it to me and I think when you play that
way<00:01:35.880> no<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.450> knows<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:36.900> doing<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
way no one knows what you're doing and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
way no one knows what you're doing and
it's<00:01:37.409> hard<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> read<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> I've<00:01:38.790> learned

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's hard to read off you I've learned

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.670 
it's hard to read off you I've learned
now<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.600> got<00:01:39.750> always<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.170> ready<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.500> shoot

now that I got always be ready to shoot

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.780 
now that I got always be ready to shoot
when<00:01:40.920> he's<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> puck<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.299> stick<00:01:43.790> for

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
one to get open and sometimes it's just

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.230 
one to get open and sometimes it's just

way you think about the game how you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.630 
way you think about the game how you
know<00:02:42.700> good<00:02:43.239> ways<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.570> not<00:02:43.690> get<00:02:43.900> tied<00:02:44.140> up<00:02:44.170> he<00:02:44.640> one

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
know good ways to not get tied up he one

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.130 
know good ways to not get tied up he one
thing<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.030> really<00:02:46.270> sticks<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.870> he<00:02:46.959> said

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
thing that really sticks out is he said

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.690 
thing that really sticks out is he said
never<00:02:47.350> have<00:02:47.500> your<00:02:47.650> stick<00:02:47.830> on<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.130> ice<00:02:48.160> when

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
never have your stick on the ice when

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.190 
never have your stick on the ice when
you're<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:48.880> front<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.180> net<00:02:49.360> because<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
you're in front of the net because the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.220 
you're in front of the net because the
demon<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:50.830> can<00:02:51.130> tie<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.370> up<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.209> think<00:02:52.360> he's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
demon can can tie it up so I think he's

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.600 
demon can can tie it up so I think he's

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.870 
you I'm trying to do it subtly
I<00:04:06.700> think<00:04:07.920> just<00:04:08.920> like<00:04:09.040> anything<00:04:09.280> else<00:04:09.489> if<00:04:09.760> we

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
I think just like anything else if we

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.430 
I think just like anything else if we
ignore<00:04:10.120> him<00:04:10.150> know<00:04:10.660> him<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.959> little<00:04:11.049> bit<00:04:11.290> too

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
ignore him know him a little bit too

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.760 
ignore him know him a little bit too
much<00:04:11.680> about<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.599> might<00:04:13.599> turn<00:04:14.110> him<00:04:14.290> off<00:04:14.440> about

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
much about it might turn him off about

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.250 
much about it might turn him off about
the<00:04:14.920> idea<00:04:15.250> but<00:04:15.280> we'd<00:04:15.849> love<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.390> him<00:04:16.630> he's

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
the idea but we'd love to have him he's

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.529 
the idea but we'd love to have him he's
got<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.500> family<00:04:17.770> he's<00:04:18.099> got<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.910> life<00:04:19.180> he<00:04:19.390> knows

what<00:04:19.810> what<00:04:20.320> he<00:04:20.410> wants<00:04:20.770> but<00:04:21.419> hopefully<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.750> can

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780
