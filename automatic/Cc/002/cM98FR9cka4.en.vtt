00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
they also should super accurately super

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
they also should super accurately super
fast<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.210> almost<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.780> our<00:00:49.170> playing

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
fast so this is almost like our playing

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
fast so this is almost like our playing
a<00:00:50.000> multiplayer<00:00:51.410> every<00:00:52.460> license<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> kill<00:00:53.760> all

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a multiplayer every license to kill all

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.959 
a multiplayer every license to kill all
so<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:58.239> did<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:58.870> bit<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.500> test<00:00:59.739> run<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.579> I

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
so I just did a bit of a test run and I

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.600 
so I just did a bit of a test run and I
doubt<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.230> this<00:01:02.500> isn't<00:01:02.860> so<00:01:03.040> easy<00:01:03.070> even<00:01:03.399> though

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
doubt so this isn't so easy even though

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.000 
doubt so this isn't so easy even though
have<00:01:03.910> all<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.300> weapons<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:05.350> infinite<00:01:05.830> ammo

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
have all the weapons and infinite ammo

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.030 
have all the weapons and infinite ammo
it's<00:01:07.000> uh<00:01:07.300> it's<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:09.369> challenging<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.310> reason

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it's uh it's very challenging the reason

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.749 
it's uh it's very challenging the reason
well<00:01:15.040> you'll<00:01:15.250> see<00:01:15.460> soon<00:01:15.790> why<00:01:16.090> why<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.840> really
