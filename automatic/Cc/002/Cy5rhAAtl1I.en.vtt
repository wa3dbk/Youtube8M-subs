 Hi, I'm a band and welcome again to 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.230
 my channel every book is a world and today 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.460
 I bring you special video that is a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.570
 deep zinc deposit and it's the first 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.480
 once I ask for a book depository and the 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.920
 I really thought that I was not going to get there 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.530
 because a lot of people say that it takes 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.680
 much in coming that then it is lost and I 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.430
 I asked him on May 22 and today we are 25 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.520
 June I went with him today because I scored 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.310
 Mexico Post Office and they told me that she 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.280
 had arrived then it was for him if 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.840
 I would buy a book depository again 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.980
 although I was if I had distrust of 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.280
 that was lost by all 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.620
 comments that are about that but as 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.600
 does not have shipping the truth is that 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.150
 yes again charge for the orate then 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 let's see how my book came and so on and 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.800
 Well, they are going to see what I bought 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.180
 one 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.360
 what father 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 m 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:44.770
 and the book I do not know if they already saw it but 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:47.330
 Brenda's charlotte genera were but 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.720
 Handles this book if they sell it in Mexico 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.910
 and if it's not always that this cover 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.010
 loved it has not been the cover and not 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.190
 used expensive I think it cost me 217 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.900
 dollars more or less did not know each other 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.210
 as weights 220 and 210 since that is not 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.460
 I would show here I am a fan the editions 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.970
 of pocket and if here comes a little 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.120
 mistreated the banks but it is 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.120
 all right 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.350
 surely also after I bought the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.060
 deposit collection and because it's in 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.090
 the pocket and I really like the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.490
 pocket covers then yes and this 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.360
 it was all for today it's only the 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.819
 unboxing this is the book that came to me and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.520

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.520
