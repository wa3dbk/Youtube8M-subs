00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.040
 When you have a dream 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.260
 It often does not come to you blatantly in your face ... 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.250
 Dreams always come from behind, not directly in front of your eyes 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.040
 Sometimes the dream is almost whispering to you .. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.130
 Whispers barely hear her 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.030
 It is very difficult to hear them 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.080
 Look, you must be every day in your life, 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.200
 Ready to hear what whispers in your ear. 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.160
 That moment, it was one of the darkest moments of my life. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.200
 My motivations were almost carried out, I just wanted to give up. 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.130
 I want you to be, what is supposed to be. 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.150
 Do not let anyone tell you that the doors are closed in your face. 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.130
 Do not let anyone tell you that opportunities do not exist. Do not let anyone tell you this. 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.239
 I want you to be, what you should be, because when you are supposed to be, you become an extraordinary person. 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.000
 Listen to me, I've got fear, and I've got faith. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.210
 I have decided not to walk in fear but to walk towards trust and faith. Self. 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.180
 This is the greatness within you, 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 do you hear me ? 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.290
 This is the greatness within you! 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.080
 You want to tell me, you will never become your supposed to be, 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.010
 You will not do what your supposed to do, because you are afraid? 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.110
 Some things do not materialize, 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 You are required to be prepared to face this. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.120
 They do not give you success 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.020
 But you can win it, you can get it, 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.000
 I want you to get it! 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.250
 Do not let distraction distract you. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.999
 I will never start skating. 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.290
 So, whatever you do, do not give up, 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.020
 Do not leave it. Now listen to me well. 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.200
 Just because you failed, does not mean you are a failure 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.100
 When life bothers you ... 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.200
 You must continue, just, do not give up. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.240
 If you want to achieve greatness and success, you have to go through a lot of pain. 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.280
 However, in order to succeed, you must continue ... 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.090
 If you hit the oak tree a thousand times 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.170
 In a thousand different regions, what will happen? 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.160
 But, if you hit the oak tree a thousand times and in the same area. 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
 Do you know what will happen? The oak will fall. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.170
 Will do the impossible. 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.090
 You are not only, a special person born in a distinguished time, 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.280
 You are something special ... 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.170
 You must believe and be convinced that you can do the thing that no one has ever been able to do. 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.160
 In a way, this idea will become your property. 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.240
 You have greatness within you. 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.050
 But your problem is that you are soft. 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.140
 Every time it gets harder, you leave it and give in, and I tell you. 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.220
 If you are ready to fight your way through it, 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.270
 Strive for your way through thoughtful plans, 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.150
 Fight your way 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.020
 Fight your way through it. 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.100
 If it is easy, do it all. 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.030
 You must struggle your way through it, 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.030
 You must fight fear, because, guess what? Fear is not greater than you. 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:11.150
 If you want to win in your struggle for your life, you should not be afraid to fight. 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.180
 What exactly was your pain in your body? 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.019
 I think my feet broke, my shoulder broke, my back .. 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.029
 I feel that everything is broken now. 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.270
 The doctor told me that I should not continue skiing, I simply told him, you should stop me. 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.130
 Will you do the fourth and fifth round? 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.000
 I will complete all the tours. How can you come back here for another tour? 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.060
 I do not know how ... but something inside me .. 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.060
 It is like a flame that continues to flare. 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.080
 Fear, you will not stop me. 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.000
 I walked a lot, and I came very close, to surrender now. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.240
 Someday the control will be controlled, 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.000
 Listen to me, the impossible is just a big word, launched around you by "young" 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.270
 Many of you now, life puts you in the face of the rope. 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.160
 You can not surrender, and you can not continue. 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.130
 Listen to me, if it is easy, for everyone to do. 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.000
 After all this distance, and you want to leave now, you had to surrender long ago. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.070
 It has been a long distance, to be broken now! 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.220
 For the first time in history. Jump for Kevin Robinson. 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.270
 Matt Hoffman - Hands Free 900 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.200
 Tony Hawk - 900 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.270
 Travis double jump .. 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
