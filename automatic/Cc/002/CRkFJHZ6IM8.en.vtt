00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.160
 and today we are here in this new video 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.189
 witches level 2 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.019
 in fact, as you can see , I have 18 here 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.090
 my camps plus an archers log 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.130
 while or even two witches at level 2 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 in my keep of the clans plus 6 archers 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.859
 so really a lot of stuff 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.809
 guys regarding the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.780
 spells instead I will use two furies 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.579
 and o2 cures lightning for the castle of 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.170
 clan in case it should come out while 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.270
 we have our two heroes fully 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 functioning then to react to the 15th and king 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440

 of the shield and see you very soon 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.079
 but I think we could try 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 attacking this is strong enough but 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.050
 maybe two stars we can make it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.789
 so we can put some witch 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.619

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.129

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.490

 it also destroyed being told then 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.459
 here they remained what they were and not witches 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.780
 here there were some but they died 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.970
 against this cannon that practically 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.920
 in the eighth piecing of cabbage but 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.690
 so at least one star did it 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.010
 guys this attack to try the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.019
 witches we can say he gave 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.510
 let's say it's not good enough 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.250
 nor offer great success though 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.380

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.530
 the elixir was therefore surely the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.959

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.120
