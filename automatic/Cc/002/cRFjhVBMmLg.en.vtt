00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
frozen bananas in the bottom just

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
frozen bananas in the bottom just
because<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.210> gives<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> blade<00:00:42.780> something<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
because it gives the blade something to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.740 
because it gives the blade something to
grab<00:00:43.500> onto<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.940> actually<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.539> use

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
grab onto and you can actually just use

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.830 
grab onto and you can actually just use
a<00:00:45.780> water<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> once<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> blades<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.210> covered<00:00:51.570> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
a water so once the blades are covered I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
a water so once the blades are covered I
start<00:00:52.230> blending<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
start blending I like to do it in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
start blending I like to do it in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
increments so that my blender doesn't

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
increments so that my blender doesn't
get<00:00:56.070> overworked<00:00:59.899> let<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> blending<00:01:01.649> begin
