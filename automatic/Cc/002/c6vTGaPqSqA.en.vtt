00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.910
 You can find this video fixed part man do 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.340
 a blue thumbs up and release one 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.770
 comment below 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 and have fun watching for it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.739
 following recipe we need a headline 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 cashew nuts 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.500
 that is equivalent to 250 ml 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.539
 you also need a club 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 equal to 250 ml dates 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.650
 I used medjoul here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.320
 You can buy these dates in the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.580
 supermarket not every supermarket has them 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.740
 and otherwise you just have to look where the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 nature shops you also need three 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.840
 tablespoons of cocoa we all go now 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 We are going to add ingredients to the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.049
 food processor 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.890
 we start with the cashew order 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:28.020
 doesn't matter that way but the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.780
 cocoa powder gold for it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.509
 it got a bit off the dates beware 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.310
 that you pitted them first they are also open 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.310
 as you see so the cock must look like 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.720
 we also need a tablespoon 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.720
 vanilla extract 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.470
 a little bit of himalayan salt and one 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.470
 little stevia 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.070
 this is to sweeten everything well before that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.440
 you also have that vanilla extract as well 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.900
 stevia needed and last we go 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.140
 we are going to add a little coconut butter nap 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.240
 also known as coconut oil I have it 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500
 of these are done a bake you have 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.510
 a little bit of it 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.100
 you don't have to melt it you can 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.800
 just would do in because through 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.050
 from turning it becomes coconut oil 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.480
 naturally heat up just a little 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.480
 do you need it so we will close it 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.900
 and blended 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.250
 and now see that it is ready when I do that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.140
 so take it out then it is a sticky one 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.030
 something and that is precisely the intention because 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.190
 here we can do very easily 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.200
 make cookie dough 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:06.270
 the oreo cookie dough is ready and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 this i am going to do in this for it now 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.300
 next part I want the coconut oil 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.460
 put in the food processor 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.290
 Well this is of course not 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.480
 bakers most important big piece because it is 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.730
 pretty hard and that's why I want him in 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.410
 I want to cut small pieces so that 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.460
 the food processor will catch him better 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.920
 man 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.470
 the coconut oil you actually need something 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.940
 become smoother and creamier 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.910
 so i'm not going to do that in small 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:41.160
 cutting pieces and then I do that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:43.800
 this container of coconut oil is also very good for this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.330
 your skin and for your hair for example and 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.160
 you can also do it for your entire body 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.200
 use 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.370
 make sure you take a little piece every time 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.110
 but adds 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.400
 you don't have to think much about it 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.550
 because the food processor can 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.750
 otherwise not on so just first 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.140
 few pieces 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.140
 that the year 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.110
 Yes 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.010
 here looks a lot like the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.270
 stick the sides 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.740
 you can do that with a spatula you can 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.570
 bring it back to the center 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.570
 and then was again blended 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.739
 now i go the easiest way i go 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.780
 explain how to make those oreo cookies 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.610
 we have three parts first you have 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.620
 need a round shape 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.350
 this is to determine the shape of oreo 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.180
 cookies we will keep this shape if you 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.580
 another form but have also fine 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.410
 hang around you on this round that they do 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.870
 if we put it here then we have it here 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.520
 the oreo cookie dough and this one 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.250
 we are the first we are going to use 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.500
 because this becomes the top and bottom 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.660
 from the oreo cookies we grab a small one 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.080
 a bit of this dough and then we add that 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.440
 at the bottom and you take care of it 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.450
 that you cover the entire bottom 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.270
 don't make it too fat because if you have to 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:03.530
 makes you fat then you have such a big oreo 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.260
 cookie and you want it nice and small 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.870
 because there is no need for this 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.140
 shape I would have it evenly 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.350
 divided I can take the mold off 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.400
 and then I pick another one 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.870
 section 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.870
 then I will continue until I have done everything 

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:12.489
 so the oreo cookies are ready 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:33.289
 so the oreocookies are not ready 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:35.269
 wonderful a small and mini oreo cookie 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.809
 I have to attack him just like in the 

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:37.809
 grocery store 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:47.239
 really delicious even the coconut you can taste 

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:48.349
 not very bad but could sell now 

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:51.169
 you always have the odorless coconut oil 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:54.139
 I actually do not leave it on 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:57.349
 because they are in the extra virgin coconut oil 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.539
 all nutrients still and hey 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:01.819
 you still want a nice cookie this 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.249
 oreo cookie is really delicious as in the 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:07.279
