00:00:01.472 --> 00:00:08.647
There was a time, our happiness seemed never-ending.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:15.119
I was so sure that where we were heading was right.

00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:21.492
Life was a road so certain and straight and unbending.

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:27.732
Our little road with never a crossroad in sight.

00:00:29.117 --> 00:00:35.236
Back in the days, when we spoke in civilized voices.

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:41.412
Women in white and sturdy young men at the oar.

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:48.960
Back in the days, when I let you make all my choices.

00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:56.628
We can never go back to before.

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:06.445
There was a time my feet were so solidly planted.

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:11.663
You'd sail away while I turned my back to the sea.

00:01:12.707 --> 00:01:17.922
I was content, a princess asleep and enchanted.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.777
If I had dreams, then I let you dream them for me.

00:01:24.527 --> 00:01:30.012
Back in the days, when everything seemed so much clearer.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.597
Women in white who knew what their lives held in store.

00:01:36.132 --> 00:01:42.180
Where are they now, those women who stared from the mirror?

00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:51.120
We can never go back to before.

00:01:53.848 --> 00:01:56.530
There are people out there.

00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:04.170
Unafraid of revealing that they might have a feeling.

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:08.230
Or they might have been wrong.

00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:11.920
There are people out there.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:19.350
Unafraid to feel sorrow, unafraid of tomorrow.

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:23.340
Unafraid to be weak.

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:28.380
Unafraid to be strong.

00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:35.260
There was a time, when you were the person in motion.

00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:40.850
I was your wife, it never occurred to want more.

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.870
You were my sky.

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:54.480
My moon and my stars and my ocean.

00:02:55.869 --> 00:03:03.550
We can never go back to before.

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:08.490
We can never go back

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:18.700
to before.

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:46.520
(Rapturous applause ensues...we thought it would never end!)
