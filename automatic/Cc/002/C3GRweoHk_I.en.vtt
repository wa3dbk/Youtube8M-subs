 This is Quindío, a beautiful department of Colombia 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.320
 which is located in the central west region of the country, 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.560
 its capital is Armenia and the neighboring Paisas that make up the coffee axis, 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.210
 are the departments of Caldas and Risaralda 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.610

 this important department of the country 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.410
 was touched nine years ago by a devastating telluric movement, 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.080
 which hit the prosperous coffee region 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.290
 Dozens of buildings collapsed, 13,000 homes collapsed 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.210
 and the death toll is still not known exactly 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.800
 it was an earthquake that brought down architecture, 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.160
 swept up with parts of the story 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.860
