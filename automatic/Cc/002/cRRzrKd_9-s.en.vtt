color<00:00:34.200> let's<00:00:34.590> start<00:00:34.770> off<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:34.950> edge<00:00:35.160> first

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
color let's start off with edge first

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
color let's start off with edge first
and<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.450> turn<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.020> edge<00:00:37.170> feature

and when you turn on the edge feature

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.520 
and when you turn on the edge feature
what<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.160> does<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.750> drew<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> couple<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
what this does is if I drew a couple of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.959 
what this does is if I drew a couple of
lines<00:00:42.739> what<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.860> does<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.370> will<00:00:44.520> apply<00:00:44.879> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
lines what it does is it will apply a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.900 
lines what it does is it will apply a
border<00:00:45.570> around<00:00:46.170> every<00:00:47.010> line<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.399> draw<00:00:47.670> now

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
border around every line that I draw now

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.279 
border around every line that I draw now
right<00:00:48.059> now<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.239> don't<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.600> anything<00:00:48.899> because

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
right now you don't see anything because

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.139 
right now you don't see anything because
currently<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.219> edge<00:00:50.340> color<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.820> set<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> white

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
currently the edge color is set to white

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.260 
currently the edge color is set to white
but<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.930> click<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.289> button<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
now see very faintly a blue outline

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.460 
now see very faintly a blue outline
let's<00:01:03.480> bring<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.140> bit<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
let's bring this out a little bit so you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
let's bring this out a little bit so you
can<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:06.090> adjust<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
can really see it will adjust the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.539 
can really see it will adjust the
thickness<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> edges<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.650> by<00:01:08.220> adjusting

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
thickness of the edges here by adjusting

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
thickness of the edges here by adjusting
the<00:01:08.700> slider<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:11.540> now<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.229> blue

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the slider and now you can see this blue

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
the slider and now you can see this blue
outline<00:01:15.290> around<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.890> lines<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.310> again<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
outline around the lines and again this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.789 
outline around the lines and again this
is<00:01:18.600> something<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.960> applies<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.229> every<00:01:19.619> line

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
is something that applies to every line

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.170 
is something that applies to every line
that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.220> draw<00:01:21.110> as<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.290> draw<00:01:22.590> you'll<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.180> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that I now draw as I draw you'll see the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
that I now draw as I draw you'll see the
edge<00:01:24.299> outline<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.049> applied<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> you'll<00:01:26.310> also

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
edge outline is applied and you'll also

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.789 
edge outline is applied and you'll also
notice<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.439> lines<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
notice that if there are lines that

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.330 
notice that if there are lines that
overlap<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.090> border<00:01:30.420> adjusts<00:01:31.110> accordingly

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
overlap the border adjusts accordingly

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.580 
overlap the border adjusts accordingly
now<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:33.329> thing<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> note<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.380> is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
now a good thing to note is that this is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
now a good thing to note is that this is
non-destructive<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.060> didn't<00:01:36.240> want<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
non-destructive so if I didn't want to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
non-destructive so if I didn't want to
have<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.750> effect<00:01:37.049> anymore<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> would<00:01:37.619> simply

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
have this effect anymore I would simply

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
have this effect anymore I would simply
just<00:01:38.130> turn<00:01:38.340> off<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> effect<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.329> back<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
just turn off the effect and I'm back to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
just turn off the effect and I'm back to
where<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.159> next<00:01:41.280> cycle<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.670> were

with<00:01:48.060> screen<00:01:48.329> tones<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.750> manga<00:01:49.020> studio<00:01:49.200> is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
with screen tones in manga studio is

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
with screen tones in manga studio is
that<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:50.040> easily<00:01:50.130> adjust<00:01:50.850> them<00:01:51.030> so

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that you can very easily adjust them so

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
that you can very easily adjust them so
I<00:01:51.930> currently<00:01:52.200> had<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> tone<00:01:53.159> line<00:01:53.460> number<00:01:53.820> set

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I currently had the tone line number set

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359 
I currently had the tone line number set
to<00:01:54.210> 50<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.560> wanted<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> change<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> dots

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
to 50 but if I wanted to change the dots

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.090 
to 50 but if I wanted to change the dots
to<00:01:56.670> something<00:01:57.000> bigger<00:01:57.240> let's<00:01:57.570> say<00:01:57.750> 30<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.619> would

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to something bigger let's say 30 I would

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.649

and<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:03.210> dots<00:02:03.450> adjust<00:02:03.840> accordingly<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.590> can

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and the dots adjust accordingly I can

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.339 
and the dots adjust accordingly I can
adjust<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:06.290> density<00:02:07.290> whether<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> want<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
adjust the density whether and I want to

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.449 
adjust the density whether and I want to
use<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> color<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:10.950> brightness<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
angle if I select a noise pattern I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.930 
angle if I select a noise pattern I
could<00:02:44.260> adjust<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.650> size<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.220> factor<00:02:45.790> or

could adjust the size and the factor or

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.690 
could adjust the size and the factor or
strength<00:02:46.300> of<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.510> noise<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.520> then<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.550> can

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
strength of the noise and then I can

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.550 
strength of the noise and then I can
offset<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.210> dot<00:02:49.420> position<00:02:49.600> by<00:02:49.960> adjusting<00:02:50.410> its

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
offset the dot position by adjusting its

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.440 
offset the dot position by adjusting its
X<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:50.920> y<00:02:51.130> values<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.000> very<00:02:52.210> helpful

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.140 
is now converted to tone and just like
with<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.010> tone<00:03:21.190> layer<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.670> can<00:03:21.850> change

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
with the tone layer you can change

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150 
with the tone layer you can change
things<00:03:22.420> like<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.780> line<00:03:23.140> number<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.620> density

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
things like the line number the density

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.690 
things like the line number the density
the<00:03:24.490> angle<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.650> offset<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.370> when

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
the angle and the the offset and when

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.120 
the angle and the the offset and when
you've<00:03:27.820> saved<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.270> copy<00:03:28.420> or<00:03:28.920> exported<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.010> in

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
you've saved a copy or exported it in

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.700 
you've saved a copy or exported it in
this<00:03:30.520> format<00:03:31.300> simply<00:03:31.960> switch<00:03:32.260> off<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.560> tone

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
this format simply switch off the tone

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.820 
this format simply switch off the tone
toggle<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.960> it's<00:03:34.960> back<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.230> color<00:03:35.440> now

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
toggle and it's back to color now

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.350 
toggle and it's back to color now
finally<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.220> have<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.430> layer<00:03:36.610> color<00:03:36.910> toggle

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
finally we have the layer color toggle

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.640 
finally we have the layer color toggle
now<00:03:37.480> what<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.780> does<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:38.050> it<00:03:38.290> takes<00:03:38.440> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
now what this does is it takes the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.860 
now what this does is it takes the
colors<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.130> active<00:03:39.550> layer<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.060> changes

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
colors of the active layer and changes

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.120 
colors of the active layer and changes
them<00:03:40.990> to<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.140> single<00:03:41.380> color<00:03:41.740> of<00:03:41.830> your<00:03:41.950> choosing

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
them to a single color of your choosing

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.460 
them to a single color of your choosing
so<00:03:42.910> with<00:03:43.240> this<00:03:43.330> set<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.600> roughs<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:44.020> have<00:03:44.200> here

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
so with this set of roughs I have here

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.200 
so with this set of roughs I have here
if<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.650> wanted<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.980> convert<00:03:45.190> them<00:03:45.550> from<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
if I wanted to convert them from a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.570 
if I wanted to convert them from a
maroon<00:03:46.540> color<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:47.050> blue<00:03:47.470> line<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.280> could<00:03:48.430> ink

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
maroon color to blue line so I could ink

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.120 
maroon color to blue line so I could ink
on<00:03:48.730> them<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.210> separate<00:03:49.720> layer<00:03:49.960> I'd<00:03:50.710> simply

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
on them on a separate layer I'd simply

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.130 
on them on a separate layer I'd simply
come<00:03:51.370> over<00:03:51.400> here<00:03:51.790> click<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.390> layer<00:03:52.810> color

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
come over here click the layer color

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.130 
come over here click the layer color
button<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:55.210> pencils<00:03:55.600> convert<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.990> blue

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
button and the pencils convert to blue

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.720 
button and the pencils convert to blue
line<00:03:56.380> now<00:03:56.560> if<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:56.830> didn't<00:03:57.040> want<00:03:57.160> blue<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.430> would

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
line now if I didn't want blue I would

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.550 
line now if I didn't want blue I would
click<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.060> arrow<00:03:58.240> and<00:03:58.540> select<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.470> different

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
click the arrow and select a different

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.170 
click the arrow and select a different
color<00:03:59.950> let's<00:04:00.220> say<00:04:00.400> green<00:04:01.650> ok<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:03.520> turns<00:04:04.060> to

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
color let's say green ok and it turns to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.730 
color let's say green ok and it turns to
green<00:04:04.420> now<00:04:04.930> initially<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.290> thought<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.590> was

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
green now initially I thought this was

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.960 
green now initially I thought this was
the<00:04:05.770> same<00:04:06.010> effect<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.370> could<00:04:06.520> do<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.700> manga

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
the same effect you could do in manga

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.940 
the same effect you could do in manga
studio<00:04:07.120> 3<00:04:07.450> &amp;<00:04:07.570> 4<00:04:07.870> namely<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.710> you<00:04:08.800> could

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
studio 3 &amp; 4 namely that you could

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.770 
studio 3 &amp; 4 namely that you could
toggle<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.370> change<00:04:09.610> in<00:04:09.760> line<00:04:09.970> color<00:04:10.270> on<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.480> black

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
toggle a change in line color on a black

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.990 
toggle a change in line color on a black
black<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.470> white<00:04:11.620> or<00:04:11.740> grayscale<00:04:12.220> later<00:04:12.460> so

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
black and white or grayscale later so

black and white or grayscale later so
imagine<00:04:13.480> my<00:04:13.570> surprise<00:04:13.600> when<00:04:14.020> I<00:04:14.290> discovered<00:04:14.680> I

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
imagine my surprise when I discovered I

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.200 
imagine my surprise when I discovered I
could<00:04:14.860> apply<00:04:15.040> this<00:04:15.160> effect<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.670> any<00:04:15.820> layer

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
could apply this effect to any layer

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.150 
could apply this effect to any layer
type<00:04:16.480> including<00:04:17.080> as<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.290> will<00:04:17.620> see<00:04:17.830> here

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
type including as you will see here

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.180 
type including as you will see here
color<00:04:19.150> layers<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.440> really<00:04:20.739> cool<00:04:20.920> thing

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
color layers and the really cool thing

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.159 
color layers and the really cool thing
is<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.460> combine<00:04:21.820> effects<00:04:22.450> so<00:04:22.840> if<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.990> want

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
is you can combine effects so if I want

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.720 
is you can combine effects so if I want
to<00:04:23.260> take<00:04:23.410> this<00:04:23.530> piece<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.070> add<00:04:24.220> some<00:04:24.520> kind<00:04:24.669> of

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
to take this piece and add some kind of

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.940 
to take this piece and add some kind of
wild<00:04:24.970> pop<00:04:25.300> art<00:04:25.570> style<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.230> I've<00:04:26.680> already

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
wild pop art style to it I've already

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.690 
wild pop art style to it I've already
changed<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.280> color

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
changed the color

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.640 
changed the color
bluh<00:04:28.090> but<00:04:28.210> let's<00:04:28.360> say<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.540> want<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:28.870> add<00:04:29.170> some

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
bluh but let's say I want to add some

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.190 
bluh but let's say I want to add some
screen<00:04:29.890> tone<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.630> now<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.660> get<00:04:31.990> this

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
screen tone to it and now I get this

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.170 
screen tone to it and now I get this
effect<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.920> I<00:04:33.130> could<00:04:33.280> always<00:04:33.370> layer<00:04:33.850> them<00:04:34.090> and

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
effect and I could always layer them and

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.050 
effect and I could always layer them and
really<00:04:35.050> call<00:04:35.200> most<00:04:35.350> create<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:36.060> bleed

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
really call most create like a bleed

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.800 
really call most create like a bleed
color<00:04:37.960> tone<00:04:38.410> effect<00:04:39.310> if<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.550> wanted<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.360> of

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
color tone effect if I wanted to and of

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.730 
color tone effect if I wanted to and of
course<00:04:40.990> when<00:04:41.230> I'm<00:04:41.350> done

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
course when I'm done

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.380 
course when I'm done
again<00:04:42.070> this<00:04:42.220> is<00:04:42.370> non-destructive<00:04:42.730> I<00:04:43.060> simply

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
again this is non-destructive I simply

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.180 
again this is non-destructive I simply
turn<00:04:43.720> off<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.020> toggles<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.470> I'm<00:04:44.890> back<00:04:45.040> to

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
turn off the toggles and I'm back to

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.130 
turn off the toggles and I'm back to
where<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.370> was<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.150> will<00:04:46.450> say<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.960> this

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
where I was and I will say that this

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.570 
where I was and I will say that this
layers<00:04:47.440> property<00:04:47.710> palette<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.310> something

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
layers property palette is something

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.040 
layers property palette is something
that<00:04:48.700> I<00:04:48.730> consider<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:49.090> vast<00:04:49.360> improvement<00:04:49.570> in

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
that I consider a vast improvement in

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.480 
that I consider a vast improvement in
the<00:04:50.170> series<00:04:50.530> these<00:04:50.860> are<00:04:50.920> things<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.340> simply

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
the series these are things you simply

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.520 
the series these are things you simply
could<00:04:51.790> not<00:04:51.940> do<00:04:52.240> before<00:04:52.420> especially<00:04:53.170> on

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
could not do before especially on
