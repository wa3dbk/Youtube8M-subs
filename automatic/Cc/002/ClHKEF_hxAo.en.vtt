00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.760
 my name is rock magny i live 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.790
 money it's been fifteen years since 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.790
 right here 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.380
 bah 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.230
 I got to firminy with the creepy 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.270
 and on ice necessarily arriving here 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.620
 we lift the gods we see these mountains 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.690
 and we want to go for a walk 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.760
 so go slowly we learn to do a 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.220
 little climbing serve as a rope 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.589
 ice ax crampons and then we'll do 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.780
 a ride to the great mounted after 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.610
 white valley we see slopes we have 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.540
 want to always go to the corners where 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.480
 there are not many people 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.460
 so we start we start with 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.020
 know how 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.140
 that snowboard skiing or not and script 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.610
 then 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.410
 then, of course, you have to learn 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.210
 a bit of the basics of the mountain at 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.740
 take climbed learn how to make 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.320
 reminders put relays things 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 like that and then after we increase 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.180
 gently I thought 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.700
 stiffness so so that's ready for 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.560
 acquire a trick of little trust 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.090
 so it's safe to do sports 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.369
 extremes I think there are people who 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.399
 think it's a little silly of 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.390
 take risks like that unnecessarily 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.220
 for me, it's 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.049
 for sure my wife knows me 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.149
 like that I am someone I am 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.920
 someone impulsive who likes who love 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.600
 the sport they love the commitment and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.369
 she knows I'm pretty enough 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.220
 seriously for not doing anything 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.990
 to know how to give up and then and then 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.539
 especially do that intelligently what 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.310
 have fun first and foremost and 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.810
 we have nothing to prove to others we have 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.789
 maybe a little to prove oneself to oneself 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.710
 but if we do it intelligently 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.950
 I think we can make progress without 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.950
 scare 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.220
 so if I had three runs down 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.880
 choose the most beautiful ones I've done and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.280
 there would be the north side of the courses already 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.910
 I was quite exceptional or a little 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.530
 a hold up by another memory that me 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.500
 keep in mind and this is surely the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.200
 degli descent to a corridor in there 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.209
 it was with bad charlet which is a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.510
 good friend too is good it was a 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.910
 downhill a very steep descent on a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.780
 mythical mountain and and everything went well 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.430
 unrolled so 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.870
 so that's for sure when we're going 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.230
 like that well we keep good 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.600
 memories 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.910
 I remember a good day too 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.519
 where not much in the end we find 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.900
 it fills up well it was with 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.299
 simon family and we had planned to go 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.920
 to the ideal needles like that and then that 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.269
 had to be 10:30 something like this 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.370
 then we go up in the bucket and then we 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.420
 look below we see that the mallory 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.370
 in good condition 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.950
 so we make a first mallory the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.480
 smile to the ears and then we get 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.760
 said well go back we'll do the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.400
 auxerre what is the same departure he has 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.930
 look good so we go what we like 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.630
 the hoax terms that remind you come 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.519
 on the plan it must have been 5:30 last 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.810
 dump and I say good science move on 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.519
 do a third and we take the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.440
 last bucket and so suddenly we have 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.430
 back up we have the fans pass the plan 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.980
 we 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.200
 the aspiq board that changed the game 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.659
 because before we had to 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
 to lug our rackets to do the 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.010
 snowshoe track so 1 0 slides 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.109
 what 's the walk of the blow we in 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.250
 ciemi what i say we with with my 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.349
 buddies and my big that we put it there 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.239
 two or three years ago no more because with 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.400
 the land we have here when we need 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.719
 even that it's pretty reliable because 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.090
 because here is a field that 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.829
 rocky we go places a little bit 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.739
 engaged we would not want that fixing 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.260
 and molding the board she she 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.939
 also breaks what so suddenly that's it 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.769
 going really better they really put 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.629
 the focus on the development of the gear 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.010
 and we come up with something accomplished 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.389
 and that looks a lot like what we have 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.109
 usually with our boards 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.790
 normally it's sure that at this rate 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.739
 brings us more to make bigger 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.049
 uneven that before this year we did 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.969
 two beautiful outings one at the turn of the 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.280
 taste and another the guides of the 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:16.130
 bay ranged or the unevenness by 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.139
 example of 2000 and 2300 meters so 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.220
 we definitely get to go go 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.739
 higher and further 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.110
 So that was the first in ctd 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.690
 snowboard and after that it's sure that the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.919
 season would try to start so in 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.229
 plus it was a great season so 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.130
 I hope I hope we can 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.130
 do other things
