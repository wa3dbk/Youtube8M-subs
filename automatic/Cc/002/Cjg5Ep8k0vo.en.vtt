00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
purple comments that we have done so far

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.490 
purple comments that we have done so far
you'll<00:00:17.039> see<00:00:17.369> why<00:00:17.550> when<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.940> start

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.859 

this<00:00:23.280> takes<00:00:23.520> place<00:00:23.700> in<00:00:24.120> the<00:00:24.150> space<00:00:24.540> junk

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
this takes place in the space junk

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.850 
this takes place in the space junk
section<00:00:25.290> of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.470> galaxy<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:27.779> they're<00:00:28.650> all

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
section of the galaxy and they're all

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.380 
section of the galaxy and they're all
pretty<00:00:29.220> close<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.730> each<00:00:29.820> other<00:00:29.940> so<00:00:30.240> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
pretty close to each other so this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.970 
pretty close to each other so this
should<00:00:30.540> be<00:00:30.570> pretty<00:00:30.720> easy<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.349> wrong<00:00:33.980> that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
should be pretty easy right wrong that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.020 
should be pretty easy right wrong that
music<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.480> led<00:00:36.720> this<00:00:36.870> music<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.559> epic

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
music I just led this music is so epic

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.860 
music I just led this music is so epic
because<00:00:40.430> otherwise<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.480> would<00:00:42.690> really

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
because otherwise this this would really

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:52.700 
because otherwise this this would really
be<00:00:42.960> unbearable<00:00:49.250> damn<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:51.290> so<00:00:52.290> much<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.650> me

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
be unbearable damn it so much for me

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.080 
be unbearable damn it so much for me
trying<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.040> take<00:00:53.190> shortcuts<00:00:53.489> anyway<00:00:53.970> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
trying to take shortcuts anyway the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.950 
trying to take shortcuts anyway the
reason<00:00:54.269> why<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.559> hard<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.950> it's<00:00:56.160> timed

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
reason why this is so hard is it's timed

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.680 
reason why this is so hard is it's timed
you<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.110> two<00:00:58.410> minutes<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.770> collect<00:00:59.690> 100

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you have two minutes to collect 100

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:18.390 
you have two minutes to collect 100
purple<00:01:01.020> coins<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:02.700> back<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> star

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.810 

there's<00:01:19.400> ten<00:01:19.700> batches<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:22.280> effectively

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
there's ten batches so you effectively

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.219 
there's ten batches so you effectively
have<00:01:23.090> 12<00:01:23.930> seconds<00:01:24.440> per<00:01:24.590> match<00:01:25.960> but<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:27.140> you

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
have 12 seconds per match but then you

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.690 
have 12 seconds per match but then you
have<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.410> account<00:01:27.770> with<00:01:27.950> some<00:01:28.100> time<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.520> make<00:01:28.640> a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
have to account with some time to make a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:38.570 
have to account with some time to make a
cast<00:01:29.270> on

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.540 

oh<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:39.210> barely<00:01:39.690> made<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.580 

point<00:01:43.550> of<00:01:43.670> advice<00:01:44.110> don't<00:01:45.110> make<00:01:45.320> too<00:01:45.500> many
