00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
were pretty good and this is another

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410 
were pretty good and this is another
clip<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> show<00:01:08.580> off<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.909> sort<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.299> his

clip just to show off the sort of his

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570

strength<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.930> his<00:01:10.020> pace<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.280> first

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
strength and his pace look at that first

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.039 
strength and his pace look at that first
touch<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.090> then<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> bang<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.930> his

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
touch and then to bang it with his

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.300 
touch and then to bang it with his
weaker<00:01:13.320> three<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.710> they're<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.130> good

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
weaker three so they're a very good

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
weaker three so they're a very good

actually<00:01:34.049> very<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:34.530> balanced<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
actually very well balanced like it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually very well balanced like it
wasn't<00:01:35.520> fantastic<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> wasn't<00:01:37.140> bad<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad and I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.109 
wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad and I
actually<00:01:38.070> found<00:01:38.310> myself<00:01:38.400> come<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.909> against

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
actually found myself come up against

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
actually found myself come up against
some<00:01:39.270> British<00:01:39.600> players<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.619> playing

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
some British players and it was playing

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.889 
some British players and it was playing
very<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.369> well<00:01:41.549> I've<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.150> crazy<00:01:42.570> good

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
very very well I've got some crazy good

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.539 
very very well I've got some crazy good
goals<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.500> four<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> notice<00:01:44.040> plays<00:01:44.310> in

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
goals there are four you notice plays in

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.999 
goals there are four you notice plays in
here<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.570> I'd<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:45.869> pick<00:01:46.829> out

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
here and I think I'd actually pick out

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
here and I think I'd actually pick out
three<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.579> I'll<00:01:47.700> leave<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.880> until<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.329> get

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
three but I'll leave that until we get

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
three but I'll leave that until we get
onto<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> squad<00:01:49.320> builder<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.130> I'll

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
onto the squad builder and then I'll
