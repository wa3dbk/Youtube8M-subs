instructions<00:02:39.770> they're<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.490> here<00:02:44.350> like<00:02:56.290> so

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
instructions they're in here like so

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.650 
instructions they're in here like so
there's<00:02:57.590> one<00:02:57.860> target<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.660> instructions

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
there's one target and instructions

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.580 
there's one target and instructions
right<00:02:59.870> there<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:01.330> open<00:03:02.330> these<00:03:02.510> up<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:06.050> can<00:03:06.260> see

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
right there so open these up you can see

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:15.900 
right there so open these up you can see
that<00:03:09.280> how<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.340> play<00:03:10.580> there's<00:03:10.850> whiplashed<00:03:11.540> mode

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.340 

advanced<00:03:16.910> whip<00:03:17.420> last<00:03:17.720> moment<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.260> then

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
advanced whip last moment and then

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.100 
advanced whip last moment and then
there's<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.560> defense<00:03:19.070> mode<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:20.360> pretty<00:03:20.930> cool

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
there's a defense mode so pretty cool

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.440 
there's a defense mode so pretty cool
got<00:03:21.350> tips<00:03:21.620> overall<00:03:22.100> take<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.670> better<00:03:23.120> look<00:03:23.209> at

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
got tips overall take a better look at

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.759 
got tips overall take a better look at
this<00:03:23.540> later<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.110> guys<00:03:24.350> don't<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.620> to

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
this later so you guys don't have to

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.990 
this later so you guys don't have to
watch<00:03:24.890> me<00:03:24.950> Ryu<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:29.440> there's<00:03:30.440> three<00:03:31.000> phases

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
watch me Ryu but so there's three phases

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.430 
watch me Ryu but so there's three phases
the<00:03:32.180> whole<00:03:32.390> darts<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.400> then<00:03:34.940> one<00:03:35.300> up<00:03:36.080> here

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the whole darts and then one up here

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.400 
the whole darts and then one up here
fire<00:03:36.800> just<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.420> front<00:03:38.420> loader<00:03:38.780> single<00:03:39.200> shot

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
fire just a front loader single shot

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.240 
fire just a front loader single shot
glass<00:03:39.739> they're<00:03:40.070> like<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:41.290> old<00:03:42.290> knight<00:03:42.680> finder

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
glass they're like the old knight finder

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.620 
glass they're like the old knight finder
or<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.940> newer<00:03:44.510> fire<00:03:44.840> strike<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.920> see<00:03:48.920> these<00:03:49.630> it

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
or the newer fire strike so see these it

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.860 
or the newer fire strike so see these it
has<00:03:50.750> two<00:03:51.140> little<00:03:52.300> shields<00:03:53.300> that<00:03:53.450> kind<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.720> pop

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
has two little shields that kind of pop

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.270 
has two little shields that kind of pop
out<00:03:54.050> there<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.440> that's<00:03:54.620> kind<00:03:54.860> of<00:03:54.920> cool<00:03:54.980> not

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
out there so that's kind of cool not

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.100 
out there so that's kind of cool not
sure<00:03:55.519> how<00:03:55.670> well<00:03:56.180> those<00:03:56.390> will<00:03:56.570> actually<00:03:56.690> work

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
sure how well those will actually work

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.570 
sure how well those will actually work
because<00:03:57.320> they're<00:03:57.620> only<00:03:57.769> like<00:03:57.950> an<00:03:58.130> inch<00:03:58.280> big

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
because they're only like an inch big

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.660 
because they're only like an inch big
but<00:03:59.000> that's<00:03:59.750> pretty<00:03:59.930> cool<00:04:01.810> it's<00:04:02.810> pretty<00:04:02.989> cool

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
but that's pretty cool it's pretty cool

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.960 
but that's pretty cool it's pretty cool
design<00:04:04.670> let's<00:04:04.970> see<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:06.170> has<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.560> little

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
design let's see it has this little

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.030 
design let's see it has this little
side<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.900> don't<00:04:09.380> know<00:04:09.560> what<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.740> call<00:04:09.860> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
side I don't know what you call the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.490 
side I don't know what you call the
device<00:04:10.340> under<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:10.850> trigger<00:04:11.180> thing<00:04:11.930> push<00:04:12.290> with

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
device under the trigger thing push with

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.010 
device under the trigger thing push with
your<00:04:12.530> middle<00:04:13.070> finger<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.510> allows<00:04:14.810> you

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
your middle finger and that allows you

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.150 
your middle finger and that allows you
to<00:04:15.970> move<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.150> down<00:04:17.299> like<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:18.140> guess<00:04:18.680> and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
to move it down like that I guess and

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.870 
to move it down like that I guess and
then<00:04:20.230> that's<00:04:21.230> defense<00:04:22.190> mode<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.940> guess<00:04:23.240> some<00:04:23.570> oh

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
then that's defense mode I guess some oh

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.470 
then that's defense mode I guess some oh
there<00:04:25.880> we<00:04:26.060> go

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
there we go

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.070 
there we go
see<00:04:27.080> that's<00:04:27.320> clever<00:04:27.860> okay<00:04:28.900> okay<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:31.370> that's

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
see that's clever okay okay so that's

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.720 
see that's clever okay okay so that's
this<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.140> this<00:04:33.440> is<00:04:33.620> confusing<00:04:34.010> I'm<00:04:34.340> gonna<00:04:34.520> take

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
this is this is confusing I'm gonna take

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.610 
this is this is confusing I'm gonna take
a<00:04:34.760> look<00:04:34.970> at<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.150> theater<00:04:35.540> but<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:36.140> think

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
a look at this theater but then I think

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.910 
a look at this theater but then I think
you<00:04:36.680> have<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:37.480> push<00:04:38.480> in<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.380> then<00:04:39.500> move<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.770> up

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
you have to push in and then move it up

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.160 
you have to push in and then move it up
and<00:04:40.880> then<00:04:41.660> oh<00:04:41.840> that's<00:04:42.170> how<00:04:42.320> you<00:04:42.380> prime<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.830> too

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
and then oh that's how you prime it too

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:53.680 
and then oh that's how you prime it too
that's<00:04:45.170> handy<00:04:51.490> then<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.610> fires<00:04:52.850> wow<00:04:53.270> that's

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
that's handy then it fires wow that's

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:01.480 
that's handy then it fires wow that's
interesting<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:59.860> that's<00:05:00.860> just<00:05:01.100> a<00:05:01.280> quick

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
interesting so that's just a quick

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.210 
interesting so that's just a quick
