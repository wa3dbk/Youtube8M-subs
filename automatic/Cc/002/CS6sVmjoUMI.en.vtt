00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.740
 Then it is for the forehand stroke basics 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.040
 About the impact 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:18.490
 I will explain 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:22.300
 Yes In is the first one of the important points in the impact it firmly at the time of the take-back 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:27.400
 Keeping that attitude that raised the attitude 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:32.890
 It means that we will go sideways axis as it is 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:40.690
 Rotate like the axis of the piece , squeeze to squeeze the racket and hit the impact 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:41.990
 It is very important that this is a strong sense of shaking from bottom to top 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.660
 Upon exiting 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:54.170
 Even if I get up with takeback, I try to beat it one more time and beat from below 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:57.020
 Axis causing firmly so as not to do so because Irasshaimasu so much better to 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.980
 Rotate by and impact 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:08.729
 Nature and travel and greeted go when the force of the arm of Chikarakata is missing 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:13.080
 You can now swing the racket with swing feeling and the racket head speed also increases 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.440
 I will be able to hit a hot good shot with a top spin, so practice by all means 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440
 Please give me 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 2 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.070
 1 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.000
 me 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.000
 Have 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.190
 ana's 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.860
 Hmm 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.610
 I by 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.610
 Have 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.140
 The 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:05.320
 Then it will be the second important point in impact 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 It is the arm by a centrifugal force because it rotates a shaft in a state in which the disconnect the power to disconnect the power spread to the outside 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.780
 To go 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:17.270
 In corruption in the talk to swing through the talk because it is 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:24.819
 Is really a force is easily enter and say that if the closer will be very important and 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.819
 Please open your heart to impact only in the distance can you in some of it away 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.220
 I do not have 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.460
 Hmm 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.290
 pandan 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.159
 No 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.159
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.280
 tan 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.640
 I'm waiting 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.650
 Four days 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.190
 Hmm 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.880
 Hmm 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.880
 Oh 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:12.800
 Then it becomes the important third point in impact 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:19.460
 The third point of the catch the ball in front of the body 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.770
 And that the ball just before hitting the racket before hitting is seen firmly 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.090
 It will be important 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:32.270
 If you take your eyes off the ball quickly , your body will open more easily 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:36.290
 Racket head speed hits in the slows down in Then impact 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:40.550
 Please keep in mind that you watch the ball immediately before 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:45.680
 Also if the hit point is too behind the body 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:55.510
 Because it tends to be a packed form that seems to be delayed, so firmly 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:55.510
 Please be careful not to go too far sideways to catch the bat in front of your body and practice 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.670
 I am 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.530
 Had 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.530
 Hmm 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.540
 Hmm 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.450
 Hmm 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.820
 voodoo 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.590
 Hmm

 Took 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.070
