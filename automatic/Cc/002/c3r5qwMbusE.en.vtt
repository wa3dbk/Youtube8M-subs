00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
about an opinion that I've seen brought

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.340 
about an opinion that I've seen brought
up<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.759> various<00:00:06.150> sports<00:00:06.359> journal<00:00:06.750> articles<00:00:07.140> as

up in various sports journal articles as

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.770 
up in various sports journal articles as
well<00:00:07.620> as<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.460> comment<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:08.970> my<00:00:09.090> video<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.540> why

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
well as in a comment on my video on why

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.959 
well as in a comment on my video on why
I<00:00:09.809> will<00:00:10.080> never<00:00:10.230> use<00:00:10.500> steroids<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
I will never use steroids and that is

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999 
I will never use steroids and that is
the<00:00:12.179> idea<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.690> having<00:00:13.320> certain<00:00:13.530> genetic

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the idea that having certain genetic

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.939 
the idea that having certain genetic
advantages<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.880> similar<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.170> using<00:00:16.470> steroids

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
advantages is similar to using steroids

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.400 
advantages is similar to using steroids
the<00:00:17.580> rationality<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.510> both<00:00:18.779> give<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.140> an

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the rationality is that both give you an

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
the rationality is that both give you an
unfair<00:00:19.920> advantage<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.609> comparison<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.180> your

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
unfair advantage in comparison to your

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.240 
unfair advantage in comparison to your
competition<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.289> really<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.650> doesn't

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
competition this really just doesn't

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.590 
competition this really just doesn't
make<00:00:23.369> sense<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.820> me<00:00:23.939> when<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.180> look<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
make sense to me when you look at the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960 
make sense to me when you look at the
purpose<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.199> sports<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.310> definitions<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
purpose of sports and the definitions of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
purpose of sports and the definitions of
fairness<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.720> first<00:00:27.930> definition<00:00:28.320> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
fairness the first definition of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
fairness the first definition of
fairness<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.980> found<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.789> according<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
fairness I found is just according to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.990 
fairness I found is just according to
the<00:00:30.630> rules<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.250> obviously<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.610> would<00:00:32.820> make

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the rules and obviously this would make

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
the rules and obviously this would make
steroids<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.870> according<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> rules<00:00:34.860> for

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
steroids not according to the rules for

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
steroids not according to the rules for
a<00:00:35.190> sport<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.700> drug-free<00:00:36.090> powerlifting

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
a sport like drug-free powerlifting

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
a sport like drug-free powerlifting
while<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> genetic<00:00:37.980> advantage<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.579> within<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
while a genetic advantage is within the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
while a genetic advantage is within the
rules<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> assume<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.710> most

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
rules but I'm going to assume that most

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.380 
rules but I'm going to assume that most
people<00:00:41.370> aren't<00:00:41.550> talking<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.180> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
people aren't talking about this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.940 
people aren't talking about this
definition<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.170> I've<00:00:43.710> made<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
definition because I've made the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
definition because I've made the
argument<00:00:44.399> way<00:00:44.550> too<00:00:44.610> clear-cut<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.899> most

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
argument way too clear-cut what most

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.380 
argument way too clear-cut what most
people<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.530> believe<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:46.980> referring<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
people I believe are referring to is the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.580 
people I believe are referring to is the
thought<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> can't<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.469> an

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
thought that you can't have an

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.160 
thought that you can't have an
unjustified<00:00:50.489> advantage<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.930> would

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
unjustified advantage that that would

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.080 
unjustified advantage that that would
make<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> sport<00:00:52.800> unfair<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
make a sport unfair but then the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
make a sport unfair but then the
question<00:00:54.420> becomes<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.989> makes<00:00:55.170> an<00:00:55.320> advantage

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
question becomes what makes an advantage

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
question becomes what makes an advantage
justified<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.699> answer<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
justified and the answer is it just

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
justified and the answer is it just
matters<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:58.949> simply<00:00:59.399> within<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.879> rules

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
matters if it's simply within the rules

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420 
matters if it's simply within the rules
once<00:01:00.480> again<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.500> reason<00:01:01.829> being<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
once again and the reason being is that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
once again and the reason being is that
sports<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.390> arbitrarily<00:01:03.989> set<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.619> we

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
sports are just arbitrarily set up we

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.980 
sports are just arbitrarily set up we
just<00:01:05.400> decide<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.760> these<00:01:06.000> random<00:01:06.270> parameters

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
just decide on these random parameters

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
just decide on these random parameters
and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.010> who<00:01:08.220> does<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> best

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and then we just see who does the best

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.179 
and then we just see who does the best
with<00:01:09.119> those<00:01:09.330> parameter<00:01:09.900> set<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.950> no

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
with those parameter set there is no

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.560 
with those parameter set there is no
point<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.850> beyond<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
point to it beyond that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.570 
point to it beyond that
so<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.229> break<00:01:13.560> those<00:01:13.770> rules<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.369> break

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so if you break those rules you break

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
so if you break those rules you break
the<00:01:14.729> entire<00:01:15.000> purpose<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:15.990> sport<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the entire purpose of your sport see I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.690 
the entire purpose of your sport see I
think<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
think that that's where the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
think that that's where the
misunderstanding<00:01:17.939> lies<00:01:18.600> people<00:01:19.140> assume<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
misunderstanding lies people assume that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.289 
misunderstanding lies people assume that
there<00:01:19.830> needs<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.340> justification<00:01:20.729> for

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
there needs to be a justification for

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539 
there needs to be a justification for
each<00:01:21.750> rule<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> sport<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> reality<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
each rule for a sport but the reality is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
each rule for a sport but the reality is
the<00:01:23.850> simple<00:01:24.210> fact<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> rule<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the simple fact that it is a rule is the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130 
the simple fact that it is a rule is the
justification<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> also<00:01:27.270> why<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.900> no

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
justification this is also why I have no

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.380 
justification this is also why I have no
problem<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.860> untested<00:01:29.369> lifters<00:01:29.939> who<00:01:29.970> use

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
problem with untested lifters who use

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
problem with untested lifters who use
steroids<00:01:30.689> there's<00:01:31.170> no<00:01:31.439> moral<00:01:31.829> issue<00:01:32.040> there

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
steroids there's no moral issue there

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
steroids there's no moral issue there
because<00:01:32.549> their<00:01:32.939> sport<00:01:33.329> allows<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.409> not

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
because their sport allows it it's not

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.109 
because their sport allows it it's not
against<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> rules<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.909> some

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
against the rules then I think some

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
against the rules then I think some
people<00:01:36.210> interpret<00:01:36.630> unfairness<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.619> any

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
people interpret unfairness as any

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.039 
people interpret unfairness as any
inequality<00:01:38.280> whatsoever<00:01:39.240> regardless<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
inequality whatsoever regardless of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
inequality whatsoever regardless of
justification<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.460> doesn't<00:01:41.790> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
justification and this doesn't really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.249 
justification and this doesn't really
work<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:42.869> defeat<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
work because this would defeat the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.410 
work because this would defeat the
entire<00:01:43.530> purpose<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:44.460> athletics<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
entire purpose of athletics of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
entire purpose of athletics of
competition<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> whole<00:01:47.040> point<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
competition because the whole point is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
competition because the whole point is
to<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> variation<00:01:48.840> when<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> have

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
to see the variation when you have

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.010 
to see the variation when you have
specific<00:01:50.070> parameters<00:01:50.549> set<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.720> who

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
specific parameters set up to see who

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.929 
specific parameters set up to see who
comes<00:01:52.259> out<00:01:52.470> who<00:01:52.770> does<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> best<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.820> that's

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
comes out who does the best so that's

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.460 
comes out who does the best so that's
why<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.119> sports<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.780> varying<00:01:55.140> degrees<00:01:55.170> of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
why all sports have varying degrees of

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
why all sports have varying degrees of
specificity<00:01:56.070> when<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> comes<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.969> how<00:01:57.060> they

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
specificity when it comes to how they

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.120 
specificity when it comes to how they
set<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.479> their<00:01:57.719> rules<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.619> example<00:01:59.040> in

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
set up their rules for example in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
set up their rules for example in
powerlifting<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.060> weight<00:02:00.329> classes

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
powerlifting we have weight classes

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
powerlifting we have weight classes
however<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.100> weight<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.670> then

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
however we don't have weight and then

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.850 
however we don't have weight and then
high<00:02:03.030> classes<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.719> then<00:02:03.810> experience<00:02:04.500> level

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
high classes and then experience level

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100 
high classes and then experience level
classes<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.820> don't<00:02:06.030> keep<00:02:06.240> breaking<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.869> down

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
classes we don't keep breaking it down

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
classes we don't keep breaking it down
until<00:02:07.500> everyone's<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.280> an<00:02:08.429> equal

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
until everyone's just an equal

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.820 
until everyone's just an equal
competition<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.470> said<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
competition because then as I said that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.940 
competition because then as I said that
would<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.160> defeat<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.700> whole<00:02:11.849> purpose<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
would just defeat the whole purpose of

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.589 
would just defeat the whole purpose of
petition<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.520> first<00:02:13.760> place<00:02:14.209> at<00:02:14.300> another

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
petition in the first place at another

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.540 
petition in the first place at another
point<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.080> see<00:02:15.260> being<00:02:15.470> extended<00:02:15.980> from<00:02:16.160> this

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
point I see being extended from this

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.580 
point I see being extended from this
argument<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.269> equates<00:02:17.629> cero<00:02:17.959> use<00:02:18.260> with<00:02:18.500> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
argument that equates cero use with the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.040 
argument that equates cero use with the
genetic<00:02:18.950> advantage<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:20.209> well<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.750> easy

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
genetic advantage is that well it's easy

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.780 
genetic advantage is that well it's easy
for<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.560> say<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.069> you're<00:02:22.190> against<00:02:22.640> using

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
for you to say that you're against using

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.100 
for you to say that you're against using
steroids<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.599> you're<00:02:23.720> against

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
steroids and that you're against

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.020 
steroids and that you're against
breaking<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> rules<00:02:24.830> because<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.790> are

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
breaking the rules because you are

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.910 
breaking the rules because you are
gifted<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.780> don't<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.440> resort<00:02:27.620> to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
gifted so you don't have to resort to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.490 
gifted so you don't have to resort to
that<00:02:28.160> however<00:02:28.760> what<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> say<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
that however what I say to that is that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500 
that however what I say to that is that
you<00:02:30.920> don't<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.730> excel<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.300> any

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you don't have to excel in any

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.410 
you don't have to excel in any
particular<00:02:32.810> sport<00:02:33.560> it's<00:02:33.860> not<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.269> be

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
particular sport it's not a right to be

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.229 
particular sport it's not a right to be
great<00:02:35.720> at<00:02:35.900> anything<00:02:36.200> for<00:02:36.950> example<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:37.610> track<00:02:37.940> I

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
great at anything for example in track I

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.900 
great at anything for example in track I
simply<00:02:38.989> was<00:02:39.200> not<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.709> genetically<00:02:40.220> talented

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
simply was not that genetically talented

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.940 
simply was not that genetically talented
at<00:02:41.150> long<00:02:41.420> jumping<00:02:41.900> despite<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.560> simply

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
at long jumping despite that I simply

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.130 
at long jumping despite that I simply
tried<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.580> hardest<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.209> was<00:02:44.599> satisfied<00:02:45.110> with

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
tried my hardest and was satisfied with

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.559 
tried my hardest and was satisfied with
the<00:02:45.349> progress<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:46.190> made<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.760> that's<00:02:47.330> why<00:02:47.480> I've

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
the progress I made and that's why I've

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.180 
the progress I made and that's why I've
said<00:02:47.780> before<00:02:47.930> that's<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.620> important<00:02:49.069> that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
said before that's so important that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.920 
said before that's so important that
you're<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.519> happy<00:02:49.790> with<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.239> progress<00:02:50.450> you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you're just happy with the progress you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.630 
you're just happy with the progress you
make<00:02:51.140> rather<00:02:51.680> than<00:02:51.950> always<00:02:52.099> comparing

make rather than always comparing

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.550 
make rather than always comparing
yourself<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.000> others<00:02:53.420> also<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:54.170> brings<00:02:54.410> up

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
yourself to others also this brings up

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.530 
yourself to others also this brings up
another<00:02:54.650> important<00:02:55.340> point<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.209> need<00:02:56.360> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
another important point that you need to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.479 
another important point that you need to
pursue<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.110> you're<00:02:57.319> naturally<00:02:57.530> talented<00:02:58.370> at

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
pursue what you're naturally talented at

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.759 
pursue what you're naturally talented at
you<00:02:59.000> may<00:02:59.239> not<00:02:59.480> be<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.720> great<00:03:00.019> sprinter<00:03:00.500> for

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
you may not be a great sprinter for

you may not be a great sprinter for

advantage what they tend to respond with

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.590 
advantage what they tend to respond with
is<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:34.069> it's<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.579> even<00:03:34.880> their<00:03:35.060> genetics

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
is that it's not even their genetics

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.660 
is that it's not even their genetics
they<00:03:36.049> try<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.319> deny<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.010> even<00:03:37.459> plays<00:03:37.639> a

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
they try to deny that that even plays a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.610 
they try to deny that that even plays a
factor<00:03:38.000> that's<00:03:38.420> just<00:03:38.690> their<00:03:38.840> hard<00:03:39.139> work<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620

that's all and to me that that is a
