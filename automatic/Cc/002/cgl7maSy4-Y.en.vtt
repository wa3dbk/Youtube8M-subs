00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the you know this and that's it but it's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
the you know this and that's it but it's
way<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.440> than<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.940> need

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
way more than that it's more they need

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.950 
seat and see how that one's installed
can<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:11.150> how<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.330> how's<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.720> car

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
can we do that how about how's this car

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
can we do that how about how's this car
seat<00:01:13.170> first<00:01:14.070> thing<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
seat first thing we would look at the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
seat first thing we would look at the
baby<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> seat<00:01:16.439> belts

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
baby was in here is if the seat belts

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.370 
baby was in here is if the seat belts
were<00:01:16.920> adjusted<00:01:17.430> appropriately<00:01:18.060> these<00:01:19.020> look<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
were adjusted appropriately these look a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.140 
were adjusted appropriately these look a
little<00:01:19.500> twisted<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.400> maybe<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.640> little<00:01:20.820> loose

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
little twisted and maybe a little loose

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
little twisted and maybe a little loose
and<00:01:21.689> also<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:22.500> was<00:01:22.590> something<00:01:22.920> added<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and also there was something added to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.550 
and also there was something added to
the<00:01:23.580> car<00:01:23.790> seat<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.150> wasn't<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.600> crash

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the car seat that wasn't that crash

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
the car seat that wasn't that crash
tested<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.280> most<00:01:26.549> likely<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.540> need<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
tested so most likely this would need to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.109 
tested so most likely this would need to
come<00:01:27.900> off<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.130> also<00:01:29.159> check<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> make

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
come off we would also check and make

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
come off we would also check and make
sure<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> car<00:01:30.900> seat<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.380> appropriate

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
sure that the car seat is appropriate

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
sure that the car seat is appropriate
for<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> baby's<00:01:32.460> age<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.090> weight<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.630> we

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
for the baby's age and weight so we

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.710 
for the baby's age and weight so we
would<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> decals<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.280> um<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
would look at all the decals and um this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
would look at all the decals and um this
