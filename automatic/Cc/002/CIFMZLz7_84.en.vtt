00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
his managers and then there is a third

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.249 
his managers and then there is a third
now<00:02:05.060> each<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.390> these<00:02:05.570> arrows<00:02:05.899> will<00:02:06.110> be

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
now each of these arrows will be

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.070 
now each of these arrows will be
pointing<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.830> another<00:02:07.000> process<00:02:08.000> object<00:02:08.270> who

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
title within it so it's that easy to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.460 
title within it so it's that easy to
create<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.580> flow<00:02:14.120> chart<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.540> employees<00:02:15.080> going
