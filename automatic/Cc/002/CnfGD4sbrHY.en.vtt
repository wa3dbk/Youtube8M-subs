going to look at is how to I form type

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
going to look at is how to I form type
here<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.060> run<00:01:06.270> plays<00:01:06.450> our<00:01:06.750> motion

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
here and the two run plays our motion

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.190 
here and the two run plays our motion
power<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> motion<00:01:08.760> zone<00:01:09.030> week<00:01:09.390> now

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
power and motion zone week now

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.230 
power and motion zone week now
unfortunately<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.100> can't<00:01:11.549> set<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> audibles

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
unfortunately I can't set the audibles

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.700 
unfortunately I can't set the audibles
and<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.470> don't

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and as you can see right here we don't

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.330 
and as you can see right here we don't
have<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.880> other<00:01:15.150> run<00:01:15.600> play<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.009> book<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
have the other run play in this book so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
have the other run play in this book so
what<00:01:17.460> we're<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> let's<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.170> say

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
what we're going to do is let's just say

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
what we're going to do is let's just say
we<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:19.590> allowed<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> settle<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.340> those<00:01:20.580> okay

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
we are allowed to settle on those okay

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.210 
we are allowed to settle on those okay
so<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.600> run<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.530> we're

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
so we have a run to the right we're

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.640 
so we have a run to the right we're
going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> count<00:01:23.729> defenders<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.530> see

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
going to count defenders and if we see

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
going to count defenders and if we see
that<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:25.979> favorable<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.729> run<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> right

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that it's favorable to run to the right

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810 
that it's favorable to run to the right
like<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.049> might<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.770> its<00:01:29.100> kind<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
like it might be right here its kind of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.210 
like it might be right here its kind of
even<00:01:30.119> considering<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> defenders<00:01:32.100> on

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
even considering that the defenders on

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.530 
even considering that the defenders on
the<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> safety<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.210> stuff<00:01:33.420> like

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the right like the safety and stuff like

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
the right like the safety and stuff like
that<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.079> playing<00:01:34.200> down<00:01:34.610> if<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that are kind of playing down if it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490 
that are kind of playing down if it's
favorable<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.600> run<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.350> we'll

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
favorable to run to the right then we'll

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
favorable to run to the right then we'll
call<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.799> plane<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.369> favorable<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.240> run

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
call this plane if it's favorable to run

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.960 
call this plane if it's favorable to run
to<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> left<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.619> we'll<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.950> audible<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to the left then we'll just audible to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.210 
to the left then we'll just audible to
the<00:01:42.000> other<00:01:42.390> play<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:43.560> I've<00:01:43.829> already<00:01:44.009> been

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the other play now I've already been

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.399 
the other play now I've already been
running<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.939> crazy<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.869> game<00:01:46.110> so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
running this like crazy in this game so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.109 
running this like crazy in this game so
I<00:01:46.439> hope<00:01:46.770> while<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.369> trying<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> tip

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
I hope while I'm trying to do this tip

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.389 
I hope while I'm trying to do this tip
video<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:49.079> don't<00:01:49.290> finally<00:01:49.829> snuff<00:01:50.130> me<00:01:50.369> out

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
video they don't finally snuff me out

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.760 
video they don't finally snuff me out
just<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.820> I've<00:01:51.689> been<00:01:51.990> killing<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.649> with

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
just because I've been killing them with

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
just because I've been killing them with
it<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.130> game<00:01:53.369> long<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> computer<00:01:54.450> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it all game long and it is a computer so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.649 
it all game long and it is a computer so
I'm<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> assume<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.210> they<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.240> going

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I'm going to assume that they are going

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
I'm going to assume that they are going
to<00:01:57.719> clamp<00:01:58.020> down<00:01:58.140> sooner<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:58.950> later<00:01:59.189> but<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to clamp down sooner or later but I

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.109 
to clamp down sooner or later but I
promise<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.979> whether<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.520> success<00:02:02.909> here

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
promise you whether I have success here

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.719 
promise you whether I have success here
or<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.750> play<00:02:04.140> these<00:02:04.829> two<00:02:05.130> plays<00:02:05.399> are

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
or not this play these two plays are

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.660 
or not this play these two plays are
nasty<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> look<00:02:08.039> at<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> motion

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
nasty so just take a look at the motion

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.940 
nasty so just take a look at the motion
of<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.209> tight<00:02:09.479> end<00:02:09.720> first<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.800> you're

of this tight end first of all as you're
going<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.129> see<00:02:11.220> he's<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> run<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
going to see he's going to run it the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.540 
going to see he's going to run it the
same<00:02:12.270> way

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
same way

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.970 
same way
and<00:02:13.210> that's<00:02:13.420> very<00:02:13.660> important<00:02:14.320> okay<00:02:14.740> we<00:02:15.340> need

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the arm see as you can see here 23

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.220 
the arm see as you can see here 23
carries<00:02:20.530> for<00:02:20.860> 173<00:02:21.640> yards<00:02:21.850> we<00:02:22.750> need<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.050> make

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
carries for 173 yards we need to make

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.220 
carries for 173 yards we need to make
sure<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.970> auto<00:02:25.180> motion<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.870> run<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
sure that the auto motion is run the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.500 
sure that the auto motion is run the
same<00:02:26.620> way<00:02:26.830> at<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.280> same<00:02:27.490> speed<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:27.880> both<00:02:28.210> run

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
same way at the same speed in both run

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.900 
same way at the same speed in both run
plays<00:02:28.780> because<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.650> it's<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:30.250> if<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.700> player

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
plays because if it's not if the player

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.330 
plays because if it's not if the player
kind<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.300> slides<00:02:31.630> or<00:02:32.080> starts<00:02:32.950> running

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
kind of slides or starts running

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.050 
kind of slides or starts running
sideways<00:02:33.880> instead<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:35.050> sliding<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.710> just<00:02:36.060> you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
sideways instead of sliding it just you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.550 
sideways instead of sliding it just you
want<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.360> make<00:02:37.510> sure<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.870> he<00:02:37.990> moves<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.380> same

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
want to make sure that he moves the same

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.160 
want to make sure that he moves the same
way<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.950> can<00:02:39.130> assure<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.760> he<00:02:39.820> does<00:02:40.240> so

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
way and I can assure you that he does so

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.700 
way and I can assure you that he does so
here<00:02:41.410> we're<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.710> run<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.950> again<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
here we're going to run it again and the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.930 
here we're going to run it again and the
reason<00:02:44.860> i<00:02:45.010> love<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.610> look<00:02:45.760> at<00:02:45.850> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
reason i love it is just look at the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.600 
reason i love it is just look at the
blocking<00:02:46.330> we<00:02:46.540> get<00:02:46.690> three<00:02:47.170> lockers<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.370> again

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
blocking we get three lockers and again

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.730 
blocking we get three lockers and again
even<00:02:48.910> though<00:02:49.030> i<00:02:49.060> did<00:02:49.390> get<00:02:49.540> snuffed<00:02:49.840> out<00:02:50.050> a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
even though i did get snuffed out a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.840 
even though i did get snuffed out a
snuffed<00:02:51.580> out<00:02:51.700> there<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> little<00:02:52.090> bit<00:02:53.670> we<00:02:54.670> had

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
snuffed out there a little bit we had

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.610 
snuffed out there a little bit we had
three<00:02:55.120> blockers<00:02:55.660> which<00:02:55.690> i<00:02:55.960> absolutely<00:02:56.110> love

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
three blockers which i absolutely love

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.560 
three blockers which i absolutely love
and<00:02:56.920> just<00:02:57.220> as<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> compliment<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
and just as a compliment you know the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.030 
and just as a compliment you know the
motion<00:02:58.930> power<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.410> definitely<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.890> more

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
motion power is definitely the more

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.220 
motion power is definitely the more
effective<00:03:00.310> run<00:03:00.670> play<00:03:00.880> but<00:03:01.810> as<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:01.990> can<00:03:02.050> see

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
effective run play but as you can see

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.450 
effective run play but as you can see
here<00:03:02.470> we're<00:03:02.620> going<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:02.800> be<00:03:02.890> able<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.160> do<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.310> to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
here we're going to be able to do it to

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.700 
here we're going to be able to do it to
the<00:03:03.550> other<00:03:03.670> side<00:03:03.730> as<00:03:04.030> well<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.630> we<00:03:05.110> run<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.440> here

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
the other side as well so we run it here

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the other side as well so we run it here
they<00:03:05.950> think<00:03:06.160> we're<00:03:06.280> going<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.460> run<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
they think we're going to run to the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.810 
they think we're going to run to the
right<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.240> we<00:03:08.020> actually<00:03:08.320> just<00:03:08.350> come<00:03:08.620> out<00:03:08.820> to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
right and we actually just come out to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.440 
right and we actually just come out to
the<00:03:09.940> left<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:11.200> they<00:03:11.290> pick<00:03:11.470> up<00:03:11.590> four<00:03:11.830> yards<00:03:12.450> that
