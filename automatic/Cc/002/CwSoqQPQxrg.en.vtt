the<00:02:10.200> chords<00:02:10.679> first<00:02:10.950> ok<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.790> whenever<00:02:11.940> you're

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the chords first ok so whenever you're

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.120 
the chords first ok so whenever you're
doing<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.690> C<00:02:12.930> chord<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.500> what<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.860> need<00:02:14.010> to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
doing a C chord this is what you need to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.920 
doing a C chord this is what you need to
do<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:17.130> let's<00:02:17.340> move<00:02:17.489> on<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> F<00:02:18.030> chord<00:02:18.299> same

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
do now let's move on to the F chord same

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.949 
do now let's move on to the F chord same
thing<00:02:19.170> we're<00:02:19.320> going<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.470> move<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.040> right

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
thing we're going to move to the right

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.850 
thing we're going to move to the right
okay<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.170> might<00:02:22.320> leave<00:02:22.470> what<00:02:22.620> could<00:02:22.769> be

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
okay and you might leave what could be

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.580 
okay and you might leave what could be
moved<00:02:23.040> down<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:23.870> yes<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.079> could<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:25.470> that's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
moved down here yes we could but that's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.979 
moved down here yes we could but that's
gonna<00:02:25.910> no<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.269> going<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.540> sound<00:02:27.690> quite

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
gonna no it's not going to sound quite

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.810 
gonna no it's not going to sound quite
as<00:02:28.019> good<00:02:28.290> as<00:02:28.410> moving<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.040> right<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.459> moving

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
as good as moving to the right of moving

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.530 
as good as moving to the right of moving
up<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.239> we're<00:02:30.630> going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:30.959> F<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:32.100> C

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
up so we're going to have F and C

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.250 
up so we're going to have F and C
together<00:02:33.540> two<00:02:33.989> times

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.820 

change<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.769> deeper<00:02:37.900> okay<00:02:38.900> now<00:02:39.409> now<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
change it to deeper okay now now the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.309 
change it to deeper okay now now the
baseline<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.879> left<00:02:41.450> hand<00:02:41.659> is<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:41.900> kind<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.200> a

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
baseline the left hand is just kind of a

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.000 
baseline the left hand is just kind of a
steady

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
steady

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.250 
steady
you<00:02:43.459> know<00:02:43.599> rhythmic<00:02:44.599> thing<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.080> too

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
you know rhythmic thing it's not too

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.580 
you know rhythmic thing it's not too
complicated<00:02:45.680> ever<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.170> right<00:02:48.349> hand

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
complicated ever so that the right hand

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.259 
complicated ever so that the right hand
will<00:02:48.739> be<00:02:48.950> free<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.280> improvise<00:02:49.849> and<00:02:50.060> do<00:02:50.150> all

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
will be free to improvise and do all

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.940 
will be free to improvise and do all
sorts<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.659> cool<00:02:50.870> things<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.319> with<00:02:51.650> blue

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
- C - G - alright if you added those

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.810 
- C - G - alright if you added those
numbers<00:03:43.870> all<00:03:44.020> together<00:03:44.170> you'd<00:03:44.560> get<00:03:44.770> 24

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
numbers all together you'd get 24

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.170 
numbers all together you'd get 24
all<00:03:46.360> right<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.630> what's<00:03:46.840> 12<00:03:47.170> bar<00:03:47.410> well<00:03:47.830> each<00:03:48.190> -

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
all right so what's 12 bar well each -

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.410 
all right so what's 12 bar well each -
equals<00:03:50.140> one<00:03:50.350> measure<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.310> divide<00:03:51.670> 24<00:03:52.180> by<00:03:52.240> 2

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
equals one measure so you divide 24 by 2

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.840 
equals one measure so you divide 24 by 2
and<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.750> get<00:03:52.870> 12<00:03:53.230> 12<00:03:53.950> bar<00:03:54.250> blues<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.670> that's

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
and you get 12 12 bar blues so that's

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.150 
and you get 12 12 bar blues so that's
kind<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.150> interesting<00:03:55.390> his<00:03:56.170> music<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.770> mostly

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
kind of interesting his music is mostly

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.590 
kind of interesting his music is mostly
in<00:03:57.490> fours<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.390> eights<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.410> 16s<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.160> 32s<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:01.180> 12

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
in fours in eights and 16s and 32s so 12

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.900 
in fours in eights and 16s and 32s so 12
is<00:04:01.840> kind<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.170> odd<00:04:02.410> but<00:04:02.800> it<00:04:02.920> works<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.580> it

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
is kind of odd but it works and it

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.220 
is kind of odd but it works and it
sounds<00:04:04.240> good<00:04:04.390> too<00:04:04.570> right<00:04:04.600> here<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.020> guess

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
sounds good too right here I guess

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.720 
sounds good too right here I guess
because<00:04:05.410> we've<00:04:05.560> heard<00:04:05.710> it<00:04:05.860> our<00:04:05.980> whole<00:04:06.490> lives

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
because we've heard it our whole lives

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.929 
this other stuff will be covered and
following<00:06:49.129> lessons<00:06:49.520> but<00:06:49.669> I'm<00:06:49.759> going<00:06:49.879> ahead

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:49.939 
following lessons but I'm going ahead

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:51.790 
following lessons but I'm going ahead
and<00:06:50.090> put<00:06:50.270> it<00:06:50.389> on<00:06:50.479> one<00:06:50.750> board<00:06:50.990> for<00:06:51.229> convenience

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
and put it on one board for convenience

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.330 
and put it on one board for convenience
so<00:06:52.310> there's<00:06:52.669> less<00:06:52.940> than<00:06:53.150> one
