a little bit but it just seems a little
sleeker<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.739> then<00:03:56.580> maybe<00:03:56.760> it's<00:03:56.970> not<00:03:57.150> working

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.340 
don't necessarily take my word on it but
that's<00:05:59.160> what<00:05:59.610> i<00:05:59.640> read<00:06:00.000> somewhere<00:06:00.300> one<00:06:01.140> last

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
that's what i read somewhere one last

that's what i read somewhere one last
thing<00:06:01.560> that<00:06:01.620> i<00:06:01.800> almost<00:06:01.950> forgot<00:06:02.460> is<00:06:03.230> google

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
thing that i almost forgot is google

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.520 
thing that i almost forgot is google
maps<00:06:04.620> they<00:06:05.010> completely<00:06:05.730> redid<00:06:06.570> Google<00:06:07.350> Maps

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
maps they completely redid Google Maps

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.590 
maps they completely redid Google Maps
the<00:06:07.770> icon<00:06:08.010> obviously<00:06:08.490> looks<00:06:08.670> different<00:06:09.090> if<00:06:09.510> i

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
the icon obviously looks different if i

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.660 
the icon obviously looks different if i
can<00:06:09.780> get<00:06:09.930> this<00:06:10.040> yeah<00:06:11.040> that's<00:06:11.340> not<00:06:11.520> gonna

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
can get this yeah that's not gonna

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.070 
can get this yeah that's not gonna
you're<00:06:11.970> not<00:06:12.000> gonna<00:06:12.120> be<00:06:12.240> able<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.420> see<00:06:12.480> that<00:06:12.600> all

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
you're not gonna be able to see that all

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.390 
you're not gonna be able to see that all
right<00:06:13.200> but<00:06:13.410> if<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.620> open<00:06:13.800> it<00:06:13.830> up<00:06:13.950> it<00:06:14.130> actually

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
right but if you open it up it actually

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.180 
right but if you open it up it actually
just<00:06:14.760> looks<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.210> lot<00:06:15.510> nicer<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:16.650> lot<00:06:17.010> more

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
just looks a lot nicer a lot more

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.430 
just looks a lot nicer a lot more
detailed<00:06:17.850> i<00:06:18.180> have<00:06:18.570> not<00:06:18.690> actually<00:06:18.900> really<00:06:19.230> used

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
detailed i have not actually really used

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.440 
detailed i have not actually really used
it<00:06:19.620> so<00:06:20.340> that's<00:06:20.580> kind<00:06:20.820> of<00:06:20.850> why<00:06:21.000> I<00:06:21.030> forgot<00:06:21.420> about

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
it so that's kind of why I forgot about

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.630 
it so that's kind of why I forgot about
it<00:06:21.690> directions<00:06:22.470> are<00:06:22.620> probably<00:06:23.010> a<00:06:23.100> lot<00:06:23.310> more

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
it directions are probably a lot more

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.940 
it directions are probably a lot more
accurate<00:06:24.570> I<00:06:24.750> would<00:06:24.900> say<00:06:25.140> they're<00:06:25.680> pretty

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
accurate I would say they're pretty

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.400 
accurate I would say they're pretty
accurate<00:06:26.310> before<00:06:26.670> but<00:06:27.450> probably<00:06:28.260> more

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
accurate before but probably more

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.110 
accurate before but probably more
accurate<00:06:28.470> now<00:06:29.040> but<00:06:29.430> yeah<00:06:29.550> everything<00:06:29.970> just

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
accurate now but yeah everything just

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.630 
accurate now but yeah everything just
looks<00:06:30.300> a<00:06:30.480> lot<00:06:30.600> more<00:06:30.660> detailed<00:06:31.290> about<00:06:32.130> it<00:06:32.310> you

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
looks a lot more detailed about it you

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.280 
looks a lot more detailed about it you
just<00:06:32.820> have<00:06:32.940> to<00:06:33.000> drag<00:06:33.300> out<00:06:33.540> the<00:06:33.690> bottom<00:06:33.990> right

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
just have to drag out the bottom right

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.700 
just have to drag out the bottom right
corner<00:06:34.640> to<00:06:35.640> get<00:06:36.240> your<00:06:36.390> options<00:06:36.810> like<00:06:37.020> drop<00:06:37.290> pin

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
corner to get your options like drop pin

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.239 
corner to get your options like drop pin
print<00:06:38.580> show<00:06:39.210> traffic

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 
print show traffic

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.359 
print show traffic
and<00:06:40.789> then<00:06:40.879> you<00:06:40.969> can<00:06:41.119> either<00:06:41.269> do<00:06:41.479> standard

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:42.369 
and then you can either do standard

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:45.479 
and then you can either do standard
which<00:06:43.369> you<00:06:43.819> can<00:06:43.939> actually<00:06:44.119> clearly<00:06:44.659> see<00:06:44.929> where

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:45.489
