 I will tell about the main rules of behavior on 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.659
 road perfectly understood first sit down 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.199
 and get out of the car just to the side 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.719
 sidewalk 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:17.199
 doing it from the road is dangerous 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:19.990
 need to get under the car in the second 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.419
 always wear seat belts 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.800
 being in the car 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.949
 it doesn't matter if you are in a child seat 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.039
 or on a regular seat 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.289
 This also applies to adults in the third children 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.990
 should only sit in the back seat 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.800
 in the front too dangerous in the case 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.990
 accidents are still the case if the children are sitting 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.150
 on the hands they are not fastened 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:48.610
 safety belt and can seriously 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.919
