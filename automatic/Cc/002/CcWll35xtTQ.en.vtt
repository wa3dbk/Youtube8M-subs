is<00:02:29.080> absolutely<00:02:29.799> awesome<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.099> he's<00:02:30.250> finishing

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
is absolutely awesome and he's finishing

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.610 
is absolutely awesome and he's finishing
really<00:02:31.030> good<00:02:31.209> for<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> winger<00:02:32.140> as<00:02:32.290> well

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
really good for a winger as well

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.619 
really good for a winger as well
I<00:02:32.650> definitely<00:02:33.340> advisement<00:02:34.030> right<00:02:34.180> wing<00:02:34.420> or

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
I definitely advisement right wing or

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.509 
I definitely advisement right wing or
right<00:02:35.049> forward<00:02:35.440> not<00:02:35.620> right<00:02:35.769> missus<00:02:36.190> tackle

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
right forward not right missus tackle

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.190 
right forward not right missus tackle
and<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:36.640> poor<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.450> he's<00:02:37.569> balanced<00:02:37.989> he's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and it's poor and he's balanced he's

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.180 
and it's poor and he's balanced he's
balanced<00:02:38.500> actually<00:02:38.799> isn't<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.010> how<00:02:39.159> I

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
balanced actually isn't that how I

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.309 
balanced actually isn't that how I
believe<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.610> around<00:02:39.730> 66<00:02:40.329> but<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.900> game<00:02:41.110> he

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
believe it's around 66 but in game he

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.690 
believe it's around 66 but in game he
didn't<00:02:41.560> really<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:41.799> pushed<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.159> 14<00:02:42.519> which

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
didn't really get pushed to the 14 which

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.490 
didn't really get pushed to the 14 which
is<00:02:42.760> quite<00:02:43.299> impressive<00:02:43.540> though<00:02:44.290> yeah

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
is quite impressive though yeah

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.259 
is quite impressive though yeah
negatives<00:02:45.370> about<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.640> guy's<00:02:45.819> his<00:02:46.030> best

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
negatives about this guy's his best

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.699 
negatives about this guy's his best
which<00:02:46.480> can<00:02:46.690> really<00:02:46.959> let<00:02:47.140> him<00:02:47.230> down<00:02:47.260> at<00:02:47.500> times

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
which can really let him down at times

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.410 
which can really let him down at times
and<00:02:47.980> now<00:02:48.400> I'm<00:02:48.549> then<00:02:48.700> he's<00:02:48.910> actually<00:02:49.030> quite

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
and now I'm then he's actually quite

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.119 
and now I'm then he's actually quite
slow<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.810> react<00:02:50.049> like<00:02:50.379> overall<00:02:50.739> one<00:02:50.859> is<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
slow to react like overall one is on the

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.470 
slow to react like overall one is on the
ball<00:02:51.310> he's<00:02:51.670> pretty<00:02:51.910> quick<00:02:52.120> when<00:02:52.239> you've<00:02:52.359> got

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
ball he's pretty quick when you've got

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.059 
ball he's pretty quick when you've got
control<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.840> him<00:02:53.049> but<00:02:53.440> when<00:02:53.560> he's<00:02:53.650> making<00:02:53.799> runs

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
control of him but when he's making runs

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.500 
control of him but when he's making runs
and<00:02:54.250> stuff<00:02:54.340> like<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.609> he<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:54.879> be<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.269> slow

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
and stuff like that he can be very slow

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.210 
and stuff like that he can be very slow
to<00:02:55.569> react<00:02:55.780> which<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.379> quite<00:02:56.590> confusing<00:02:57.040> but

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
to react which is quite confusing but

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.949 
to react which is quite confusing but
he's<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.430> very<00:02:57.730> fun<00:02:57.970> player<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.299> use<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.720> if<00:02:58.870> you

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
he's a very fun player to use and if you

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.449 
he's a very fun player to use and if you
use<00:02:59.079> incorrectly<00:02:59.379> he'll<00:02:59.890> be<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.069> deadly

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
use incorrectly he'll be a deadly

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.130 
use incorrectly he'll be a deadly
