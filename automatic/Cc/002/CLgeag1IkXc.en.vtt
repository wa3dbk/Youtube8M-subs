go<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.239> middle<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.540> die<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:46.020> if<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.470> start<00:02:46.800> my

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
go in the middle I die or if I start my

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.440 
go in the middle I die or if I start my
streak<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> middle<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.970> know<00:02:48.060> I'll<00:02:48.180> start

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
streak in the middle you know I'll start

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.759 
streak in the middle you know I'll start
in<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> middle<00:02:48.720> get<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> couple<00:02:49.290> kills<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.709> I

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
in the middle get a couple kills and I

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.900 
in the middle get a couple kills and I
know<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> fact<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.489> they're<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.850> be

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
know for a fact that they're going to be

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.759 
know for a fact that they're going to be
coming<00:02:51.000> back<00:02:51.269> so<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.720> try<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.110> avoid<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.620> area

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
coming back so I try to avoid that area

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.500 
coming back so I try to avoid that area
at<00:02:52.950> all<00:02:53.010> costs<00:02:53.310> which<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.120> want<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.360> stay

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
through that tunnel just because I know

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.360 
through that tunnel just because I know
on<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> other<00:03:07.620> end<00:03:07.830> usually<00:03:08.070> there's

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
on the other end usually there's

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.850 
on the other end usually there's
somebody<00:03:08.730> for<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.360> type<00:03:09.540> 95<00:03:09.870> or<00:03:10.200> FM<00:03:10.410> GS<00:03:10.650> or

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860

somebody for the type 95 or FM GS or
sitting<00:03:11.100> on<00:03:11.160> top<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.459> tunnel<00:03:11.760> or

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
sitting on top the tunnel or

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.670 
sitting on top the tunnel or
what-have-you<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.959> that's<00:03:13.260> usually<00:03:13.560> how<00:03:13.650> it

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
what-have-you so that's usually how it

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.770 
what-have-you so that's usually how it
works<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.130> try<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.610> not<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.060> run<00:03:15.630> through

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
works so I try to not to run through

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.990 
works so I try to not to run through
that<00:03:15.959> tunnel<00:03:16.140> there<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.730> games<00:03:17.880> pretty

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that tunnel there so this games pretty

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.850 
that tunnel there so this games pretty
much<00:03:18.299> wrapping<00:03:18.540> up<00:03:18.750> i<00:03:18.870> get<00:03:19.019> my<00:03:19.110> MOA<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.620> killed
