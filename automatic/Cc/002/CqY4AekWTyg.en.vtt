00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
haven't yet done it together as a major

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.430 
haven't yet done it together as a major
was<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.600> something<00:01:47.840> you'd<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.200> do

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
was that something you'd like to do

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.980 
was that something you'd like to do
maybe<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:49.820> think<00:01:50.149> we<00:01:50.210> will<00:01:50.330> at<00:01:50.479> some<00:01:50.509> point<00:01:50.630> I

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
maybe I think we will at some point I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.510 
maybe I think we will at some point I
think<00:01:51.259> obviously<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.619> difficult<00:01:52.280> for<00:01:52.369> him

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
think obviously it's difficult for him

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.400 
think obviously it's difficult for him
just<00:01:52.700> how<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.910> play<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.810> know<00:01:53.840> singles<00:01:54.289> and

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
just how to play you know singles and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.900 
just how to play you know singles and
doubles<00:01:54.740> at<00:01:54.860> Grand<00:01:55.070> Slams<00:01:55.310> because<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.820> know

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
doubles at Grand Slams because you know

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.669 
doubles at Grand Slams because you know
the<00:01:56.030> singles<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:56.509> demanding<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.170> five<00:01:57.380> sets

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
the singles so demanding of a five sets

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.010 
the singles so demanding of a five sets
and<00:01:57.860> stuff<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:58.160> yeah<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.700> think<00:01:58.789> it<00:01:59.030> 11<00:01:59.810> stage

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
and stuff but yeah I think it 11 stage

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.910 
and stuff but yeah I think it 11 stage
will<00:02:00.170> probably<00:02:00.410> try<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.590> play<00:02:00.770> Wimbledon

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
will probably try and play Wimbledon

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.279 
will probably try and play Wimbledon
together<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:02.570> know<00:02:02.660> see<00:02:02.840> how<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.080> all<00:02:03.200> right

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
together you know see how that all right

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.020 
together you know see how that all right
so<00:02:03.470> you've<00:02:03.979> obviously<00:02:04.039> wanted<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.580> women's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
so you've obviously wanted a women's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.120 
so you've obviously wanted a women's
double<00:02:05.360> title<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.320> something<00:02:06.500> maybe<00:02:06.830> one

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
double title is it something maybe one

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.100 
double title is it something maybe one

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
get better when he's getting a bit big

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.140 
get better when he's getting a bit big
for<00:02:39.019> his<00:02:39.230> person<00:02:39.620> really<00:02:39.939> bringing<00:02:40.939> down<00:02:41.090> a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
for his person really bringing down a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.569 
for his person really bringing down a
few<00:02:41.420> notches<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:42.129> and<00:02:43.129> obviously<00:02:43.250> like

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
few notches it and obviously like

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.580 
few notches it and obviously like
singles<00:02:44.150> has<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.299> massive<00:02:44.569> profile<00:02:45.109> problems

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
singles has a massive profile problems

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.710 
singles has a massive profile problems
not<00:02:46.220> quite<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.579> much<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.909> a<00:02:46.939> minute<00:02:47.239> do<00:02:47.569> you

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
not quite so much of a minute do you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.270 
not quite so much of a minute do you
think<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.200> all<00:02:48.379> sort<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.650> progress<00:02:48.859> I<00:02:49.040> mean

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
think that all sort of progress I mean

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.890 
think that all sort of progress I mean
is<00:02:49.669> there<00:02:49.819> going<00:02:49.939> to<00:02:50.000> be<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.120> time<00:02:50.359> when<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.720> top

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
is there going to be a time when the top

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.390 
is there going to be a time when the top
players<00:02:51.139> are<00:02:51.439> able<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.950> play<00:02:52.069> doubles

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
players are able to play doubles

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.679 
players are able to play doubles
tournament<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:53.000> don't<00:02:53.180> think<00:02:53.299> it's<00:02:53.480> just

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
tournament so I don't think it's just

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.809 
tournament so I don't think it's just
it's<00:02:54.079> too<00:02:54.169> much<00:02:54.319> for<00:02:54.620> him<00:02:54.739> together<00:02:54.859> well<00:02:55.790> I

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
it's too much for him together well I

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.399 
it's too much for him together well I
think<00:02:55.909> I<00:02:56.239> mean<00:02:56.450> though<00:02:56.569> they've<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.019> know<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
think I mean though they've you know the

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.750 
think I mean though they've you know the
change<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.769> scoring<00:02:58.069> system<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.489> stuff<00:02:58.639> so

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
change of scoring system and stuff so

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.220 
change of scoring system and stuff so
it's<00:02:58.849> a<00:02:58.909> bit<00:02:59.030> shorter<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.569> order<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.930> get<00:03:00.079> more

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
it's a bit shorter in order to get more

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.020 
it's a bit shorter in order to get more
singles<00:03:00.709> guys<00:03:00.829> playing<00:03:01.159> and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.849> know<00:03:01.969> a<00:03:02.000> lot

when<00:07:10.350> you<00:07:11.010> know<00:07:11.100> not<00:07:11.220> just<00:07:11.400> one<00:07:11.610> grandson<00:07:11.940> one

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
when you know not just one grandson one

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.870 
when you know not just one grandson one
grandson<00:07:13.110> but<00:07:13.350> a<00:07:13.440> few<00:07:13.620> and<00:07:13.860> you<00:07:14.520> know<00:07:14.640> so<00:07:14.850> far
