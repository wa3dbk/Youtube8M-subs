cumin<00:04:51.880> in<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.620> just<00:04:53.620> think<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:53.800> would<00:04:53.949> be<00:04:54.009> a

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
cumin in I just think that would be a

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.520 
cumin in I just think that would be a
nice<00:04:54.220> combination<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.199> greens<00:04:56.199> and<00:04:56.440> the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
nice combination with the greens and the

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.810 
nice combination with the greens and the
beans<00:04:57.599> so<00:04:58.599> I'm<00:04:58.840> just<00:04:58.930> gonna<00:05:02.550> sprinkle<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.789> bit

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
beans so I'm just gonna sprinkle a bit

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:12.240 
beans so I'm just gonna sprinkle a bit
in<00:05:04.710> okay<00:05:06.599> mix<00:05:07.599> it<00:05:07.750> around<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:10.860> pretty<00:05:11.860> made

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
in okay mix it around and it pretty made

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.040 
in okay mix it around and it pretty made
a<00:05:12.280> pretty<00:05:12.520> decent<00:05:12.909> stuff<00:05:13.270> ha<00:05:13.539> I<00:05:13.690> think<00:05:13.930> it's

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
a pretty decent stuff ha I think it's

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.330 
a pretty decent stuff ha I think it's
going<00:05:14.139> to<00:05:14.229> make<00:05:14.320> about<00:05:14.560> probably<00:05:15.070> five
