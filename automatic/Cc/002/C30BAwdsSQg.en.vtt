on<00:04:29.010> automobiles<00:04:29.670> let's<00:04:30.450> see<00:04:30.600> if<00:04:30.660> we<00:04:30.810> can't<00:04:31.050> get

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
on automobiles let's see if we can't get

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.080 
on automobiles let's see if we can't get
the<00:04:31.530> amperage<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:31.950> go<00:04:32.160> down<00:04:32.370> spit<00:04:32.670> going<00:04:32.910> out

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
the amperage to go down spit going out

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.090 
the amperage to go down spit going out
the<00:04:33.840> voltage<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.500> here<00:04:34.710> should<00:04:34.950> say

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
the voltage on this here should say

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.300 
the voltage on this here should say
somewhere<00:04:35.430> around<00:04:35.570> 120<00:04:36.570> volts<00:04:37.140> when<00:04:37.980> we<00:04:38.070> start

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
somewhere around 120 volts when we start

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.860 
somewhere around 120 volts when we start
out<00:04:38.490> there's<00:04:38.700> no<00:04:38.850> amperage<00:04:39.270> at<00:04:39.390> all

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
out there's no amperage at all

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.300 
out there's no amperage at all
so<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:41.130> gages<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.730> down<00:04:42.060> below<00:04:42.450> here<00:04:42.750> and

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
so the gages is down below here and

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.620 
so the gages is down below here and
we're<00:04:44.310> getting<00:04:44.520> ready<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.880> take<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.300> go<00:04:45.390> drive

what<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.350> does<00:04:49.820> all<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.090> do<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:52.560> take<00:04:52.800> and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
what it does all you do is to take and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.070 
what it does all you do is to take and
put<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:53.820> in<00:04:53.940> here<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.560> motor<00:04:56.690> sounds<00:04:57.690> like

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
put it in here and the motor sounds like

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.200 
put it in here and the motor sounds like
a<00:04:58.110> little<00:04:58.410> sports<00:04:58.680> car<00:04:59.450> shifts<00:05:00.450> runs<00:05:01.260> good

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
a little sports car shifts runs good

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.560 
a little sports car shifts runs good
fantastic<00:05:03.210> automobile<00:05:03.840> drives

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
fantastic automobile drives

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.330 
fantastic automobile drives
if<00:05:07.020> you'll<00:05:07.230> see<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.530> amperage<00:05:07.860> on<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.160> gauge

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
if you'll see the amperage on the gauge

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.310 
if you'll see the amperage on the gauge
see<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:08.760> going<00:05:08.910> down<00:05:10.130> amperage<00:05:11.130> goes<00:05:11.430> way<00:05:11.730> down

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
see it going down amperage goes way down

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.450 
see it going down amperage goes way down
that's<00:05:13.320> what<00:05:13.590> that's<00:05:13.980> what<00:05:14.130> I<00:05:14.160> like<00:05:14.430> about

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
that's what that's what I like about

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.400 
that's what that's what I like about
electric<00:05:15.270> cars

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
electric cars

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.220 
electric cars
if<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.130> floorboards<00:05:17.790> a<00:05:17.850> car<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.840> most<00:05:19.050> it

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
if you floorboards a car that most it

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.590 
if you floorboards a car that most it
will<00:05:19.380> do<00:05:19.560> would<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:19.920> be<00:05:20.160> about<00:05:20.640> maybe<00:05:21.480> a

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
will do would this be about maybe a

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.010 
will do would this be about maybe a
hundred<00:05:21.810> amps

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
hundred amps

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.500 
hundred amps
and<00:05:24.530> that's<00:05:24.770> what<00:05:24.950> we<00:05:25.130> want<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.370> do<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.330> keep

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
and that's what we want to do is to keep

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.220 
and that's what we want to do is to keep
the<00:05:26.570> amperage<00:05:27.140> down<00:05:28.010> on<00:05:28.340> electric<00:05:28.820> car<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.990> is

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
the amperage down on electric car so is

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.430 
the amperage down on electric car so is
go<00:05:30.410> anywhere<00:05:31.360> really<00:05:32.360> anybody<00:05:32.870> wants<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.290> go
