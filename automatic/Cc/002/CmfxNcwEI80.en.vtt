and then you put your coffee grounds
into<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> filter<00:00:17.400> basket<00:00:18.830> place<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.160> here

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
into the filter basket place it in here

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.240 
into the filter basket place it in here
you<00:00:22.380> take<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.460> lid<00:00:23.900> you<00:00:24.900> put<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:28.130> screw<00:00:29.130> it

you take the lid you put it on screw it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.299 
you take the lid you put it on screw it
down<00:00:29.400> until<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> tight<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:31.700> then<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:34.800> screw

middle you're trying to make the lid
very<00:00:42.629> make<00:00:43.440> sure<00:00:43.969> this<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.239> closed<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.309> then

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
very make sure this is closed and then

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.729 
very make sure this is closed and then
when<00:00:50.360> then<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> put<00:00:51.690> something<00:00:51.930> under<00:00:52.350> here

when then you put something under here

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.549 
when then you put something under here
you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> open<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.410> now<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:58.020> turn<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> on

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
you can open this up now you turn it on

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.729 
you can open this up now you turn it on
once<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.160> starts<00:00:59.670> getting<00:00:59.910> hot<00:01:00.329> enough<00:01:00.739> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
once it starts getting hot enough the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.870 
once it starts getting hot enough the
coffee<00:01:02.039> will<00:01:02.940> come<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.510> too

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
coffee will come out of this too

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
coffee will come out of this too
after<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.270> while<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.110> coffee<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.619> done<00:01:07.950> coming

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
after a while the coffee is done coming

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.560 
after a while the coffee is done coming
out<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:08.939> dripping<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> I'm<00:01:15.330> going

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
out and it's just dripping so I'm going

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.469 
out and it's just dripping so I'm going
to<00:01:15.600> turn<00:01:15.780> off<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.259> cream<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:17.009> turn<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> off<00:01:17.880> by

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to turn off the cream or turn it off by

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.730 
to turn off the cream or turn it off by
turning<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.930> crank<00:01:21.259> after<00:01:22.259> you've<00:01:22.380> switched

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
turning this crank after you've switched

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.429 
turning this crank after you've switched
off<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> coffee<00:01:23.340> valve<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> let<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> heat<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
off the coffee valve and let it heat a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.469 
off the coffee valve and let it heat a
little<00:01:25.740> longer<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.729> pressure<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
little longer there will be pressure and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.840 
little longer there will be pressure and
D<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.100> dip<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> tip<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
D in here so you dip the tip of the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.990 
D in here so you dip the tip of the
frother<00:01:30.270> into<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> milk<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:32.460> turn<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
frother into the milk you turn on the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.580 
frother into the milk you turn on the
faucet

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
faucet

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
faucet
when<00:01:35.159> yields<00:01:35.580> achieve<00:01:35.909> desired<00:01:36.119> amount<00:01:36.720> of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
when yields achieve desired amount of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.060 
when yields achieve desired amount of
froth<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:38.100> simply<00:01:38.640> switch<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.770> can't

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
froth you simply switch it off you can't

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.680 
froth you simply switch it off you can't
take<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> lid<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.670> until<00:01:42.180> you've<00:01:42.330> let<00:01:42.570> all

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
take the lid off until you've let all

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.960 
take the lid off until you've let all
the<00:01:42.840> pressure<00:01:43.080> out<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.490> let<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> pressure

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the pressure out so to let the pressure

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.390 
the pressure out so to let the pressure
out<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.750> open<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.170> veil<00:01:46.440> going<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
out I'm going to open this veil going to

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.020 
out I'm going to open this veil going to
open<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.790> fail<00:01:48.229> well<00:01:49.430> don't<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
open this fail well don't do it like I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.560 
open this fail well don't do it like I
did<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
did it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.450 
did it
you<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.380> something<00:01:52.710> under<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you want something under it so it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.420 
you want something under it so it
doesn't<00:01:53.610> make<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> mess<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.530> once<00:01:56.220> all

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
doesn't make a mess and then once all

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.550 
doesn't make a mess and then once all
the<00:01:56.640> pressure<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.149> gone<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:01.380> open

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the pressure is gone then you can open

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.860 
the pressure is gone then you can open
it<00:02:01.770> up
