then you have to go to wipe and then
advanced<00:02:03.880> wipe<00:02:04.090> first<00:02:04.780> will<00:02:04.959> make<00:02:05.079> a<00:02:05.109> backup

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
advanced wipe first will make a backup

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.419 
advanced wipe first will make a backup
of<00:02:05.500> course<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:06.039> think<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.969> already<00:02:07.119> did<00:02:07.329> that

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
of course I think you already did that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.319 
of course I think you already did that
and<00:02:09.429> swipe<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.910> wipe<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.239> course<00:02:12.090> wait<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> few

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
and swipe to wipe of course wait a few

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.960 
and swipe to wipe of course wait a few
seconds<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.970> back<00:02:16.269> go<00:02:16.569> back<00:02:17.340> now<00:02:18.340> go<00:02:18.940> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.339 
install and locate the full run and swab
to<00:02:26.799> confirm<00:02:26.829> flesh<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:28.569> course<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.260> can

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
to confirm flesh of course you can

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.110 
to confirm flesh of course you can

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
to go to just dirty flesh so just don't

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.520 
to go to just dirty flesh so just don't
erase<00:02:39.549> anything<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.480> only<00:02:41.079> apply<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.410> update

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
erase anything I only apply the update

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.849 
erase anything I only apply the update
and<00:02:42.160> then<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.579> should<00:02:42.790> be<00:02:42.970> good<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.480> go<00:02:43.859> so

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.680 
and then you should be good to go so
this<00:02:45.010> may<00:02:45.190> take<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> few<00:02:45.549> seconds<00:02:46.120> because<00:02:46.359> it's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
this may take a few seconds because it's

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.890 
this may take a few seconds because it's
around<00:02:47.109> 500<00:02:47.829> megabytes<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.340> fool<00:02:48.519> around

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
around 500 megabytes you fool around

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.870 
around 500 megabytes you fool around
please<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:50.019> patient<00:02:50.500> can<00:02:51.489> tell<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> around

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
one to two minutes so when it's done I

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.040 
one to two minutes so when it's done I
will<00:02:53.739> be<00:02:53.920> back

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
will be back

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.340 
will be back
and<00:02:57.010> boom<00:02:57.730> there<00:02:58.000> we<00:02:58.030> go<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:58.750> he<00:02:58.870> didn't<00:02:59.170> take

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
and boom there we go so he didn't take

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.560 
and boom there we go so he didn't take
that<00:02:59.380> long<00:02:59.560> at<00:02:59.830> all<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.220> now<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.150> course<00:03:01.210> you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
that long at all and now of course you

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.770 
that long at all and now of course you
can<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:02.050> go<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.400> restore<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.510> whatever

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
can just go to restore go to whatever

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.680 
can just go to restore go to whatever
you<00:03:05.110> want<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.680> restore<00:03:06.190> data<00:03:06.520> I<00:03:06.850> think<00:03:07.570> it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
you want and restore data I think it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.130 
you want and restore data I think it
should<00:03:07.840> work<00:03:07.960> just<00:03:08.140> fine<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:09.750> if<00:03:10.750> you've<00:03:10.930> done

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
should work just fine and if you've done

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.480 
should work just fine and if you've done
that<00:03:11.380> or<00:03:11.620> if<00:03:11.770> you<00:03:11.860> don't<00:03:11.980> want<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.340> do<00:03:12.460> that

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
that or if you don't want to do that

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.260 
that or if you don't want to do that
just<00:03:12.910> reboot<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.590> reboot<00:03:14.920> system<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:16.060> can

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
just reboot so reboot system you can

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.410 
just reboot so reboot system you can

some<00:03:38.020> problems<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.710> some<00:03:38.980> people<00:03:39.280> have<00:03:39.310> with

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
some problems that some people have with

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.360 
some problems that some people have with
it<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:41.050> let's<00:03:41.410> see<00:03:41.560> if<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:41.770> can<00:03:41.950> cap<00:03:42.190> the

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
it so let's see if we can cap the

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:50.820 
it so let's see if we can cap the
bootlegger<00:03:42.970> here<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:48.540> there<00:03:49.540> we<00:03:49.660> go<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.680> it's

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
bootlegger here and there we go so it's

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.220 
bootlegger here and there we go so it's
a<00:03:51.010> cyanogen<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.910> when<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:52.780> finally<00:03:53.080> booted

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
a cyanogen and when it's finally booted

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:08.230 
a cyanogen and when it's finally booted
up<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.620> will<00:03:53.770> be<00:03:53.890> back<00:03:54.010> with<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.340> guys
