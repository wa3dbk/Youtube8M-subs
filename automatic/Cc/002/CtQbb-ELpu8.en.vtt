there we go that's better and that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.220 
there we go that's better and that
that's<00:00:41.090> why<00:00:41.270> I'm<00:00:41.330> trying<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.660> sell<00:00:41.900> but<00:00:42.110> this

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
that's why I'm trying to sell but this

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.130 
that's why I'm trying to sell but this
is<00:00:42.350> one<00:00:43.040> they<00:00:43.130> always<00:00:43.370> had<00:00:43.550> my<00:00:44.540> self-propelled

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
is one they always had my self-propelled

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
is one they always had my self-propelled
or<00:00:45.290> anything<00:00:45.470> that<00:00:45.830> doesn't<00:00:45.980> have<00:00:46.130> a

or anything that doesn't have a
transmission<00:00:46.550> everything<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:47.060> it<00:00:47.150> but<00:00:47.300> I

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
transmission everything in it but I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.690 
transmission everything in it but I
won't<00:00:48.200> start<00:00:48.530> now<00:00:48.590> sink<00:00:49.220> it's<00:00:49.340> something<00:00:49.610> with

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
won't start now sink it's something with

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.800 
won't start now sink it's something with
the<00:00:49.790> carburetor<00:00:50.060> you<00:00:50.270> know<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:50.390> took<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.690> whole

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
the carburetor you know I took the whole

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.770 
the carburetor you know I took the whole
carburetors<00:00:51.290> system<00:00:51.590> off<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:51.980> it's<00:00:52.220> getting

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
carburetors system off and it's getting

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.119 
carburetors system off and it's getting
weak<00:00:53.780> spark<00:00:54.140> which<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:54.559> probably<00:00:54.800> ignition

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
weak spark which is probably ignition

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.590 
weak spark which is probably ignition
coil<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.580> but<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:56.180> has<00:00:56.270> a<00:00:56.300> really<00:00:56.450> low

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
coil and but it has a really low

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600 
coil and but it has a really low
compression<00:00:57.020> which<00:00:57.320> makes<00:00:58.010> me<00:00:58.129> think<00:00:58.160> piston

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
compression which makes me think piston

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.340 
compression which makes me think piston
rings<00:00:58.820> or<00:00:59.059> maybe<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.510> stuck<00:00:59.809> valve<00:00:59.840> I'm<00:01:00.230> not

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
rings or maybe a stuck valve I'm not

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.490 
rings or maybe a stuck valve I'm not
sure<00:01:00.670> but<00:01:01.670> um<00:01:02.080> I'll<00:01:03.080> deal<00:01:03.290> with<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.410> later

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
sure but um I'll deal with it later

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.340 
sure but um I'll deal with it later
anyway<00:01:03.950> so<00:01:04.160> I<00:01:04.400> did<00:01:05.210> some<00:01:05.420> work<00:01:05.540> for<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.840> lady<00:01:06.110> on

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
anyway so I did some work for a lady on

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.260 
anyway so I did some work for a lady on
her<00:01:06.650> tractor<00:01:08.259> cub<00:01:09.259> cadet<00:01:09.640> 2008<00:01:10.640> probably<00:01:11.090> cub

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
her tractor cub cadet 2008 probably cub

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.910 
her tractor cub cadet 2008 probably cub
cadet<00:01:11.509> one<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.750> zero<00:01:11.960> turn<00:01:12.170> ones<00:01:12.410> but<00:01:12.770> it's

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
cadet one of the zero turn ones but it's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.469 
cadet one of the zero turn ones but it's
like<00:01:13.009> a<00:01:13.040> tractor<00:01:13.880> with<00:01:13.910> steering<00:01:14.210> wheel<00:01:14.300> but

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
like a tractor with steering wheel but

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.920 
like a tractor with steering wheel but
it<00:01:14.600> breaks<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.990> wheel<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.310> in<00:01:20.119> exchange

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
it breaks the wheel and so I in exchange

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.200 
it breaks the wheel and so I in exchange
for<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:21.200> work<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:21.770> got<00:01:22.399> this<00:01:22.610> from<00:01:22.850> her<00:01:23.000> she

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
for that work I got this from her she

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.639 
for that work I got this from her she
doesn't<00:01:23.330> use<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.570> because<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.290> zero<00:01:24.470> turn

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
doesn't use it because it's a zero turn

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.650 
doesn't use it because it's a zero turn
so<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:24.979> get<00:01:25.100> around<00:01:25.190> everything

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
so you can get around everything

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.800 
so you can get around everything
it's<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.500> Scots<00:01:27.830> which<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.610> made<00:01:28.759> by<00:01:28.790> John<00:01:29.479> Deere

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
it's a Scots which is made by John Deere

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.530 
it's a Scots which is made by John Deere
which<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.830> also<00:01:31.070> think<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.670> YP<00:01:31.910> I<00:01:32.090> think<00:01:32.420> it's

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
which I also think is a YP I think it's

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.310 
which I also think is a YP I think it's
a<00:01:32.630> YP<00:01:32.840> which<00:01:33.320> makes<00:01:33.590> Toro<00:01:35.740> good<00:01:36.740> anyway<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.960> I

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
a YP which makes Toro good anyway so I

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.680 
a YP which makes Toro good anyway so I
got<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.160> had<00:01:40.640> old<00:01:40.850> gas<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.300> hadn't<00:01:41.450> run<00:01:41.569> for

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
got this had old gas and hadn't run for

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.330 
got this had old gas and hadn't run for
three<00:01:41.780> years<00:01:41.959> her<00:01:42.380> brother-in-law<00:01:42.709> bought<00:01:43.190> it

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
three years her brother-in-law bought it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.460 
three years her brother-in-law bought it
for<00:01:43.750> $300<00:01:44.750> or<00:01:45.050> something<00:01:45.410> at<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.560> pawn<00:01:45.920> shop<00:01:45.950> and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
for $300 or something at a pawn shop and

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.419 
for $300 or something at a pawn shop and
then<00:01:49.569> then<00:01:50.569> gave<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.740> her<00:01:51.920> because<00:01:52.250> he

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
then then gave it to her because he

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.590 
then then gave it to her because he
didn't<00:01:52.610> want<00:01:52.729> his<00:01:52.819> wife<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:53.000> find<00:01:53.179> out<00:01:53.479> the

didn't want his wife to find out the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.029 
didn't want his wife to find out the
heat<00:01:53.780> spent<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.560> know<00:01:54.649> dollars<00:01:54.890> on<00:01:55.009> a

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
heat spent the you know dollars on a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.559 
heat spent the you know dollars on a
mole<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.369> they<00:01:55.459> already<00:01:55.610> had<00:01:55.819> one<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.179> don't

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
mole and they already had one I don't

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.800 
mole and they already had one I don't
know

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.300 
know
it<00:01:56.959> sounds<00:01:57.319> kind<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.500> stupid<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:57.890> me<00:01:58.039> but

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
it sounds kind of stupid to me but

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.850 
it sounds kind of stupid to me but
anyway<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.300> she<00:01:59.810> gave<00:02:00.020> me<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.619> exchange

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
anyway so she gave me this in exchange

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.419 
anyway so she gave me this in exchange
for<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.160> work<00:02:01.340> instead<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.729> money<00:02:03.250> she<00:02:04.250> said<00:02:04.399> I

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
for the work instead of money she said I

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.770 
for the work instead of money she said I
could<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.729> either<00:02:04.849> war<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.330> chose<00:02:05.569> this

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
could have either war but I chose this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.469 
could have either war but I chose this
because<00:02:06.110> it's<00:02:06.590> self-propelled<00:02:07.160> has<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.000> bagger

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
because it's self-propelled has a bagger

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.230 
because it's self-propelled has a bagger
and<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:09.770> needed<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.280> new<00:02:10.310> one<00:02:10.550> because<00:02:10.640> my<00:02:10.880> Honda

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
and I needed a new one because my Honda

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
never had a self-propelled mower before

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.630 
never had a self-propelled mower before
so<00:02:24.590> I'm<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.830> kind<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.069> happy<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.490> one

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
now but has a 6.5 horsepower doesn't

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.660 
now but has a 6.5 horsepower doesn't
really<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.500> doesn't<00:02:30.650> say<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.550> is

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
really it doesn't say it on it but it is

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.580 
really it doesn't say it on it but it is
it<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.849> come<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.540> tell<00:02:32.750> by<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
it to come so I can tell by the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.920 
it to come so I can tell by the
carburetor<00:02:34.069> style<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.480> primer<00:02:35.720> bulb

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
carburetor style and the primer bulb

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.229 
carburetor style and the primer bulb
style<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.860> just<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.370> because<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.880> can<00:02:38.060> I

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
style and it just it is because I can I

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.720 
style and it just it is because I can I
know<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.569> comes<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.050> engines<00:02:39.380> look<00:02:39.560> like

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
know it comes to engines look like

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.830 
know it comes to engines look like
probably<00:02:40.730> says<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.000> under<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.330> cover<00:02:41.569> but

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
probably says it under this cover but

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.320 
probably says it under this cover but
nice<00:02:42.080> thing<00:02:42.260> about<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.500> cover<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.970> metal

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
nice thing about this cover it's metal

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.180 
nice thing about this cover it's metal
it's<00:02:44.600> not<00:02:44.750> plastic<00:02:44.960> so<00:02:45.490> um

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it's not plastic so um

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.140 
it's not plastic so um
those<00:02:47.520> are<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.730> specs<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.820> has<00:02:50.970> this

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
those are the specs for it it has this

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.980 
those are the specs for it it has this
like<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:52.230> has<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.240> easy<00:02:54.240> starting<00:02:54.720> type

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
like this has this easy starting type

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.150 
like this has this easy starting type
thing<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:56.150> what<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.240> has<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.780> some<00:02:58.560> kind<00:02:59.010> of

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
thing and what it has is some kind of

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.430 
thing and what it has is some kind of
like<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.030> releases<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.600> compression<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
like it releases the compression in a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.560 
like it releases the compression in a
certain<00:03:01.740> way<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:01.920> turn<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> engine<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.390> guess

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
certain way that turn the engine I guess

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.160 
certain way that turn the engine I guess
I'm<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.050> um<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.820> guess<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.690> Magna

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
I'm like that um I guess it's a Magna

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.400 
I'm like that um I guess it's a Magna
torque<00:03:07.470> type<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:09.690> come<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.020> engine<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:10.560> um

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
torque type to come to engine but um

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.030 
torque type to come to engine but um
electronic<00:03:13.410> ignition<00:03:13.560> for<00:03:13.800> quick<00:03:13.950> easy

starting advanced mechanical compression

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.880 
starting advanced mechanical compression
release<00:03:19.190> organic<00:03:20.190> starter<00:03:20.580> handle<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.180> auto

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
release organic starter handle and auto

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.940 
release organic starter handle and auto
enrichment<00:03:22.890> carburetor<00:03:23.930> yeah<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.920> a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
enrichment carburetor yeah it is a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.410 
enrichment carburetor yeah it is a
little<00:03:26.040> more<00:03:26.370> advanced<00:03:26.790> carburetor<00:03:27.210> than

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
little more advanced carburetor than

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.240 
little more advanced carburetor than
I've<00:03:27.540> seen<00:03:27.780> before<00:03:28.290> let's<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.100> some

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
I've seen before let's have some

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.710 
I've seen before let's have some
adjustment<00:03:29.760> screws<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.150> there<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.390> think

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
adjustment screws on there I think

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.910 
adjustment screws on there I think
there's<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.020> under<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.560> for<00:03:31.590> fuel

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
there's one under here for fuel

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.760 
there's one under here for fuel
adjustment<00:03:32.400> on<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.240> black<00:03:33.450> cap<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:34.620> I'm

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
adjustment on that black cap that I'm

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.730 
adjustment on that black cap that I'm
going<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.810> I'm<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.170> take<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> look

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
going to that I'm going to take a look

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.100 
going to that I'm going to take a look
at<00:03:37.860> because<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.340> want<00:03:39.030> adjust<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.510> mixture

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
at because I want adjust the mixture

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.920 
at because I want adjust the mixture
just<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.350> little<00:03:40.740> bit

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
just a little bit

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.880 
just a little bit
manual<00:03:42.930> throttle<00:03:43.290> which<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.500> nice<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.800> don't

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
manual throttle which is nice I don't

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.680 
manual throttle which is nice I don't
like<00:03:44.070> govern<00:03:44.400> throttles<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.060> oil<00:03:45.450> looks

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
like govern throttles the oil looks

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.490 
like govern throttles the oil looks
practically<00:03:46.500> new<00:03:46.740> like<00:03:47.430> fairly<00:03:47.790> new<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:49.080> so

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
practically new like fairly new and so

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.720 
practically new like fairly new and so
propelled<00:03:50.240> then<00:03:51.240> so<00:03:52.200> I'll<00:03:52.500> suck<00:03:52.770> this<00:03:52.920> up<00:03:53.100> it

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
propelled then so I'll suck this up it

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.010 
propelled then so I'll suck this up it
has<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> little<00:03:54.030> gas<00:03:54.270> gauge<00:03:54.540> there<00:03:54.750> too<00:03:54.900> which

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
has a little gas gauge there too which

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.230 
has a little gas gauge there too which
is<00:03:55.110> kind<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.350> nice<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:55.890> let's<00:03:56.700> let<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.060> up

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
is kind of nice but let's let this up

00:03:57.240 --> 00:05:17.950 
is kind of nice but let's let this up
for<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.860> can<00:03:58.860> do<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.160> one-handed

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.490 

yep<00:05:19.880> so<00:05:20.880> it's<00:05:20.910> it's<00:05:21.600> works<00:05:21.840> pretty<00:05:22.020> good<00:05:22.140> I

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
yep so it's it's works pretty good I

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.100 
yep so it's it's works pretty good I
like<00:05:23.340> it

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
like it

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.180

wanted to have my hand off it so I tie

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.900 
wanted to have my hand off it so I tie
it<00:05:28.350> down<00:05:28.470> with<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.680> rope<00:05:28.830> but<00:05:29.070> what<00:05:29.490> it<00:05:29.550> has<00:05:29.700> is

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
it down with a rope but what it has is

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.690 
it down with a rope but what it has is
this<00:05:30.810> doesn't<00:05:31.050> do<00:05:31.470> anything<00:05:32.750> until<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:34.700> press

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
this doesn't do anything until you press

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.770 
this doesn't do anything until you press
this<00:05:35.910> down<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.660> then<00:05:36.930> you<00:05:37.370> push<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.550> forward

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
this down and then you push this forward

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.320 
this down and then you push this forward
and<00:05:40.310> then<00:05:41.310> eventually<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.790> will<00:05:41.880> clip<00:05:42.120> and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
and then eventually it will clip and

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.580 
and then eventually it will clip and
then<00:05:42.450> just<00:05:42.690> stays<00:05:42.870> there<00:05:43.080> but<00:05:43.230> this<00:05:43.350> is<00:05:43.410> just

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
then just stays there but this is just

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.950 
then just stays there but this is just
kind<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.890> like<00:05:43.950> a<00:05:44.070> clutch<00:05:44.430> almost<00:05:44.910> this<00:05:45.660> is

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
kind of like a clutch almost this is

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.630 
kind of like a clutch almost this is
variable<00:05:46.560> up<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.740> here<00:05:47.010> if<00:05:47.160> you<00:05:47.250> just<00:05:47.370> want<00:05:47.580> to
