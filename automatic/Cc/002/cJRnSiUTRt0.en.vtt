we're<00:00:03.460> retracing<00:00:03.880> our<00:00:04.210> steps<00:00:04.270> from<00:00:04.810> where

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:04.899 
we're retracing our steps from where

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.850 
we're retracing our steps from where
we've<00:00:05.370> busted<00:00:06.370> this<00:00:06.880> new<00:00:07.600> fandangled<00:00:07.960> front

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
we've busted this new fandangled front

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.820 
we've busted this new fandangled front

diff lock when we busted the front CV so
we<00:00:11.949> just<00:00:12.070> come<00:00:12.219> for<00:00:12.369> a<00:00:12.400> walk<00:00:12.459> down<00:00:12.639> the<00:00:12.820> track

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
we just come for a walk down the track

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.180 
we just come for a walk down the track
but<00:00:13.330> you<00:00:13.930> can<00:00:14.080> see<00:00:14.260> is<00:00:14.320> not<00:00:14.469> very<00:00:14.680> rough<00:00:14.889> at<00:00:15.039> all

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
but you can see is not very rough at all

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.850 
but you can see is not very rough at all
and<00:00:16.180> at<00:00:16.600> the<00:00:16.690> end<00:00:16.930> we<00:00:17.050> tried<00:00:17.289> to<00:00:17.410> turn<00:00:17.619> right

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
and at the end we tried to turn right

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.980 
and at the end we tried to turn right
let's<00:00:18.849> go<00:00:18.970> have<00:00:19.150> a<00:00:19.179> look<00:00:19.420> as<00:00:19.570> we're<00:00:19.720> hoping<00:00:19.929> to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
let's go have a look as we're hoping to

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.279 
let's go have a look as we're hoping to
try<00:00:20.199> and<00:00:20.320> find<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.650> bits<00:00:20.920> on<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.820> ground

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
try and find the bits on the ground

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.259 
try and find the bits on the ground
where<00:00:23.289> it<00:00:23.380> dropped<00:00:23.589> its<00:00:23.740> guts<00:00:30.269> probably

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
where it dropped its guts probably

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:40.920 
where it dropped its guts probably
stopped<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:33.550> said<00:00:33.730> grace<00:00:39.449> so<00:00:40.449> this<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.780> the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
stopped it said grace so this is the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.590 
stopped it said grace so this is the
spot<00:00:41.789> and<00:00:42.789> that's<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.120> corner<00:00:43.480> we<00:00:43.570> turned

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
returning a corner and we're looking

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.800 
returning a corner and we're looking
like<00:01:13.870> this<00:01:14.530> wheel<00:01:15.100> was<00:01:15.370> very<00:01:15.610> low<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.180> the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
like this wheel was very low and the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.810 
like this wheel was very low and the
right<00:01:16.990> hand<00:01:17.230> wheel<00:01:17.350> was<00:01:17.500> high<00:01:17.740> as<00:01:18.040> we're

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
right hand wheel was high as we're

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.180 
right hand wheel was high as we're
turning<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.120> right<00:01:19.300> hand<00:01:19.540> bed<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.470> we<00:01:20.980> heard

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
turning a right hand bed and we heard

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.750 
turning a right hand bed and we heard
crunch<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.570> if<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.810> can<00:01:22.930> see<00:01:23.110> down<00:01:23.140> in<00:01:23.440> here

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
crunch and if you can see down in here

crunch and if you can see down in here
this<00:01:24.760> shaft<00:01:25.170> came<00:01:26.170> out<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.560> hole<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.850> at

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
this shaft came out of that hole so at

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.460 
this shaft came out of that hole so at
the<00:01:28.000> moment<00:01:28.180> we're<00:01:28.450> tying<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.930> up<00:01:28.990> here<00:01:29.230> out<00:01:29.380> of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
the moment we're tying it up here out of

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.900 
the moment we're tying it up here out of
the<00:01:29.530> way<00:01:29.710> with<00:01:29.890> some<00:01:29.920> zip<00:01:30.190> ties<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.430> good<00:01:30.760> old

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
the way with some zip ties a good old

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.250 
the way with some zip ties a good old
zip<00:01:31.150> ties<00:01:31.360> because<00:01:31.600> we<00:01:31.690> couldn't<00:01:31.870> find<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
zip ties because we couldn't find the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.750 
zip ties because we couldn't find the
fencing<00:01:32.680> why<00:01:32.800> you<00:01:33.010> say<00:01:33.190> so<00:01:33.250> we<00:01:33.460> had<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.730> use

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
fencing why you say so we had to use

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.950 
fencing why you say so we had to use
technologies<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.780> in<00:01:34.900> zip<00:01:35.140> ties<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:37.150> much<00:01:37.300> my

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
technologies of in zip ties so much my

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.640 
technologies of in zip ties so much my
job<00:01:37.990> now<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.620> I<00:01:39.690> believe<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:41.080> could<00:01:41.380> probably

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
job now is I believe I could probably

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.500 
job now is I believe I could probably
get<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:41.950> back<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.400> hole<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:42.970> I'm<00:01:43.390> gonna

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
get that back in that hole so I'm gonna

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.720 
get that back in that hole so I'm gonna
undo<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:44.080> here<00:01:44.410> which<00:01:44.890> requires<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.460> hammer

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
undo this here which requires a hammer

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.340 
undo this here which requires a hammer
which<00:01:46.060> is<00:01:46.210> good<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.630> lot<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.650> banging<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:49.350> we'll

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
which is good a lot of banging and we'll

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.920 
which is good a lot of banging and we'll
try<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.620> put<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.890> back<00:01:51.040> in<00:01:51.160> that<00:01:51.190> hole

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.130

Tommy was you mentioned that when I say
V<00:02:00.380> comes<00:02:00.650> apart<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.220> shaft<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.930> might<00:02:02.930> be

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
V comes apart the shaft you might be

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.900 
V comes apart the shaft you might be
able<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.470> drop<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.920> away<00:02:04.220> put<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.790> back

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
able to just drop this away put it back

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.440 
able to just drop this away put it back
together

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
guess what what oh yeah it's back in the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.250 
guess what what oh yeah it's back in the
hole<00:02:10.480> it's<00:02:11.480> little<00:02:11.750> bit<00:02:11.840> rough<00:02:11.990> around<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
hole it's little bit rough around the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.500 
hole it's little bit rough around the
edges<00:02:12.350> but<00:02:12.830> make<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:13.970> girl<00:02:14.060> knows<00:02:14.240> it's
