smoking and no drinking thing on prime

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
smoking and no drinking thing on prime
time<00:01:16.259> which<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.710> actually<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.220> clever<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
time which is actually pretty clever the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.210 
time which is actually pretty clever the
way<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> show<00:01:18.659> has

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
way they do it I think the show has

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.219 
way they do it I think the show has
exactly<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> needs<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.720> stay<00:01:21.960> alive

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
exactly what it needs to stay alive

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.740 
exactly what it needs to stay alive
unfortunately<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> time<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:24.119> day<00:01:24.240> Aaron

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
unfortunately the time in one day Aaron

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.030 
unfortunately the time in one day Aaron
is<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:25.259> off<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.740> know<00:01:25.890> what

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
is a little off but you know what

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.070 
is a little off but you know what
they're<00:01:26.460> gonna<00:01:26.549> fix<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.970> soon<00:01:27.330> Constantine

they're gonna fix that soon Constantine

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
they're gonna fix that soon Constantine
is<00:01:28.229> definitely<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> shows<00:01:29.280> that's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
is definitely one of the shows that's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
is definitely one of the shows that's
not<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> most<00:01:30.270> popular<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
not the most popular but I think it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
not the most popular but I think it
