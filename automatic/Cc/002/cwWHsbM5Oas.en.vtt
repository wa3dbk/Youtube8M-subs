00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.039
 saluzzo laura allows to reproduce the classic experience of photosynthesis 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.219
 illuminating a piece of elodea canadensis skimmers and a full test tube 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.619
 of water 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.680
 we can vary experimental conditions that influence photosynthesis 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.980
 as a distance from sorrento - use the temperature 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.720
 luxor is the monster contribution to the minute clear indicator is conducted 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 course efficiency and shock 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.360
 I use used to illuminate the plant can be white light with the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.339
 wait for a man with matic, similar to that of the solar moc 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.310
 reading the cursor you can decide which wavelength to use 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.820
 after examining the macroscopic phenomenon we can open the module 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.650
 plants 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.250
 and see where the photosynthesis takes place, details of the process 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.090
 let's start with describing the productivity agencies to compare photosynthesis e 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.090
 breathing with an easy animated pattern 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.409
 keeping beautiful eustema we show a three-dimensional representation of 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.310
 a section of the leaf and to it we superimpose its gay pride cell 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.310
 carbonic water + oxygen 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:55.539
 a thin section of the leaf allows us to see cells of the true the 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:59.469
 his proposing to be the texts that explain the different sculptures 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.340
 the program allows you to view the first question mark so that 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.609
 the teacher can make interactive visualization only professionally 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.129
 explanatory text 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.700
 each slide is also accompanied by general explanatory notes 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.409
 there are numerous images that show the different structures in detail 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.319
 leaflets such as the palisade parenchyma other showcases show 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.560
 cellular structures like this that show epithelial cells where they are 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.079
 the chloroplasts are clearly visible 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.599
 using animations you can explain physiology intuitively and 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.829
 attractive the chloroplast animation for example shows osfoora reaction 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.209
 of photosynthesis 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.439
 but it also allows air to reach the cellular structures seen 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.490
 100 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.490
 but 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:54.080
 there
