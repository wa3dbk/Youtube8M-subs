00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
2 that's really effective is the arm

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870

and<00:01:38.640> get<00:01:39.210> them<00:01:39.420> primed<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.500> main<00:01:40.740> workout

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
and get them primed for the main workout

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.420 
and get them primed for the main workout
so<00:01:42.300> that's<00:01:42.480> how<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.690> start<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.230> solid<00:01:44.040> bootcamp

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
so that's how you start a solid bootcamp

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.790 
so that's how you start a solid bootcamp
workout<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.360> warm-up<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> easier

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
workout is do a warm-up with the easier

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.580 
workout is do a warm-up with the easier
bodyweight<00:01:47.280> exercises<00:01:47.840> then<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.020> want<00:01:49.410> to<00:01:49.470> go

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
bodyweight exercises then you want to go

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.840 
bodyweight exercises then you want to go
into<00:01:49.740> what's<00:01:50.010> called<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> meat<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
into what's called the meat of the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.250 
into what's called the meat of the
program<00:01:51.240> which<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> metabolic

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
program which is the metabolic

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.020 
program which is the metabolic
resistance<00:01:52.410> training<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.280> knows<00:01:53.580> just<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
resistance training also knows just the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590 
resistance training also knows just the
strength<00:01:54.420> training<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.130> here's<00:01:56.130> where<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:57.120> lot

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
strength training and here's where a lot

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
strength training and here's where a lot
of<00:01:57.630> boot<00:01:57.870> campers<00:01:58.290> unfortunately<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.370> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
of boot campers unfortunately get it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
of boot campers unfortunately get it
wrong<00:01:59.700> from<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.930> kind<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> do

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
wrong from there they just kind of do

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.960 
wrong from there they just kind of do
sprints<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.130> drills<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.640> things<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.910> that

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
sprints and drills and things like that

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.750 
sprints and drills and things like that
which<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.330> great<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.590> when<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.040> when<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.580> do

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
which is great but when you when you do

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.820 
which is great but when you when you do
your<00:02:05.940> strength<00:02:06.390> training<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:07.350> want<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.620> do<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
your strength training you want to do it

your strength training you want to do it
immediately<00:02:08.219> after<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> war

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
immediately after the war

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
immediately after the war
when<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.599> body<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.929> fresh<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.799> when

woken up there loose and of course at

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.410 
woken up there loose and of course at
this<00:02:16.590> point<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:17.280> when<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.939> can<00:02:18.120> give<00:02:18.299> your

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
as the spider-man push up so that's

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.140

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.580 
metabolic resistance training you're
putting<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.420> more<00:03:55.600> difficult<00:03:55.810> moves<00:03:56.350> and

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
putting the more difficult moves and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
meet at the end after the warm-up so we

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.930 
meet at the end after the warm-up so we
got<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.840> warm-up<00:03:59.230> done<00:03:59.440> and<00:04:00.310> liberal<00:04:00.670> goalies

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
won't do those like 20 seconds and then

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.980 
won't do those like 20 seconds and then
we're<00:04:03.400> going<00:04:03.520> to<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.910> metabolic<00:04:04.870> resistance

feet and then midair so you go down into
the<00:05:08.230> squat<00:05:08.560> switch

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.400 

so<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.210> want<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.420> do<00:05:16.510> those<00:05:16.720> for<00:05:17.080> say<00:05:17.350> twenty

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
so you want to do those for say twenty

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.910 
so you want to do those for say twenty
to<00:05:17.860> thirty<00:05:18.100> seconds<00:05:18.610> then<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.270> move<00:05:19.450> out<00:05:19.630> into

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
to thirty seconds then you move out into

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.010 
to thirty seconds then you move out into
say<00:05:20.920> Close<00:05:21.190> Grip<00:05:21.370> push-ups<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.540> then<00:05:22.780> you<00:05:22.870> can

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
say Close Grip push-ups and then you can

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.840 
say Close Grip push-ups and then you can
start<00:05:23.230> incorporating<00:05:23.620> mountain<00:05:24.250> climbers<00:05:24.670> or

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
start incorporating mountain climbers or

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.370 
start incorporating mountain climbers or
crossbody<00:05:25.270> mountain<00:05:25.600> climbers<00:05:25.930> things<00:05:26.170> like

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
crossbody mountain climbers things like

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.840 
crossbody mountain climbers things like
that<00:05:26.560> so<00:05:27.220> that's<00:05:27.400> going<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.610> be<00:05:27.700> the

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
that so that's going to be the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.090 
that so that's going to be the
conditioning<00:05:28.450> now<00:05:28.750> this<00:05:29.440> is<00:05:29.590> kind<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.890> the<00:05:29.950> the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
conditioning now this is kind of the the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.000 
conditioning now this is kind of the the
cardio<00:05:30.910> if<00:05:31.120> you<00:05:31.240> will<00:05:31.450> of<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:32.440> workout<00:05:32.800> now

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
cardio if you will of the workout now

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.670 
cardio if you will of the workout now
obviously<00:05:33.370> you<00:05:34.210> don't<00:05:35.200> know<00:05:35.260> this<00:05:35.470> by<00:05:35.650> now

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
obviously you don't know this by now

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.890 
obviously you don't know this by now
cardio<00:05:36.340> is<00:05:36.550> not<00:05:36.730> the<00:05:36.910> best<00:05:37.090> tool<00:05:37.420> for<00:05:37.450> fat<00:05:37.870> loss

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
cardio is not the best tool for fat loss

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.170 
cardio is not the best tool for fat loss
but<00:05:38.800> this<00:05:38.920> is<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.130> way<00:05:39.280> to<00:05:39.340> incorporate<00:05:39.790> more

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
but this is a way to incorporate more

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.090 
but this is a way to incorporate more
muscle<00:05:40.660> groups<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.410> have<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.710> cardio

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
muscle groups and have that cardio

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.250 
muscle groups and have that cardio
effect<00:05:42.520> get<00:05:43.120> your<00:05:43.240> heart<00:05:43.420> rate<00:05:43.570> up<00:05:43.600> plus

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
effect get your heart rate up plus

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.540 
effect get your heart rate up plus
you're<00:05:44.410> using<00:05:44.560> more<00:05:44.830> muscles<00:05:45.190> therefore

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
you're using more muscles therefore

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.000 
you're using more muscles therefore
burning<00:05:45.880> more<00:05:46.330> calories<00:05:46.540> so<00:05:47.020> we<00:05:47.560> got<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:47.740> nail

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
burning more calories so we got a nail

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.520 
burning more calories so we got a nail
we<00:05:48.250> got<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.880> warm-up<00:05:49.270> got<00:05:50.020> metabolic

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
we got the warm-up got metabolic

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.530 
we got the warm-up got metabolic
resistance<00:05:50.710> training<00:05:51.280> of<00:05:51.940> course<00:05:52.150> those<00:05:52.360> to

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
resistance training of course those to

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.680 
resistance training of course those to
be<00:05:52.570> used<00:05:52.900> as<00:05:53.500> super<00:05:53.860> sensor<00:05:54.220> circuits<00:05:54.640> then<00:05:55.600> we

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
be used as super sensor circuits then we

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.990 
be used as super sensor circuits then we
get<00:05:55.840> into<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.320> conditioning<00:05:56.890> now<00:05:57.820> my

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
get into the conditioning now my

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.630 
get into the conditioning now my
favorite<00:05:58.390> part<00:05:58.600> is<00:05:59.110> called<00:05:59.770> the<00:06:00.040> metabolic

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
favorite part is called the metabolic

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.220 
favorite part is called the metabolic
workout<00:06:01.000> finisher<00:06:01.570> these<00:06:01.840> are<00:06:02.020> definitely

some cool stuff that you can definitely

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.780 
some cool stuff that you can definitely
use<00:06:04.450> with<00:06:04.840> your<00:06:05.320> bootcamp<00:06:05.680> workouts<00:06:06.160> this<00:06:06.610> is

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
use with your bootcamp workouts this is

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.820 
use with your bootcamp workouts this is
the<00:06:06.910> grand<00:06:07.210> finale<00:06:07.420> if<00:06:08.050> you<00:06:08.110> will<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.650> is

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
the grand finale if you will this is

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.280 
the grand finale if you will this is
where<00:06:09.040> you're<00:06:09.610> going<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:09.910> you<00:06:10.900> know<00:06:10.990> anywhere

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
where you're going to you know anywhere

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.840 
where you're going to you know anywhere
between<00:06:11.440> burpees<00:06:12.070> and<00:06:12.100> kettlebell<00:06:12.820> or

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
between burpees and kettlebell or

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.750 
between burpees and kettlebell or
dumbbell<00:06:13.330> swings<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:14.710> reps<00:06:15.070> and<00:06:15.280> sets<00:06:15.520> can

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
dumbbell swings the reps and sets can

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.360 
dumbbell swings the reps and sets can
really<00:06:16.060> vary<00:06:16.390> but<00:06:17.200> the<00:06:17.380> idea<00:06:17.740> is<00:06:17.830> to<00:06:17.890> get<00:06:18.190> your

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
really vary but the idea is to get your

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.940 
really vary but the idea is to get your
heart<00:06:18.640> rate<00:06:18.820> up<00:06:19.030> going<00:06:19.570> really<00:06:19.750> fast<00:06:20.410> with

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
heart rate up going really fast with

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.370 
heart rate up going really fast with
metabolically<00:06:21.520> domaining<00:06:22.060> exercises<00:06:22.870> with

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
metabolically domaining exercises with

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.500 
metabolically domaining exercises with
very<00:06:23.800> short<00:06:24.100> rest<00:06:24.370> periods<00:06:24.580> I've<00:06:24.940> actually

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
very short rest periods I've actually

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.210 
very short rest periods I've actually
written<00:06:25.780> some<00:06:26.110> finishers<00:06:26.500> that<00:06:26.710> lasts<00:06:26.920> only

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
written some finishers that lasts only

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.310 
written some finishers that lasts only
six<00:06:27.700> seconds<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.750> it's<00:06:28.870> called<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.140> super

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
six seconds and it's called the super

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.550 
six seconds and it's called the super
six<00:06:29.590> finisher<00:06:30.100> but<00:06:30.970> the<00:06:31.420> idea<00:06:31.750> is<00:06:31.810> for<00:06:32.140> you

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
six finisher but the idea is for you

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.960 
six finisher but the idea is for you
want<00:06:32.830> to<00:06:32.890> use<00:06:32.980> metabolic<00:06:33.520> demanding

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
want to use metabolic demanding

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.390 
want to use metabolic demanding
exercises<00:06:34.780> short<00:06:35.140> recipes<00:06:35.560> so<00:06:35.920> a<00:06:36.130> good

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
exercises short recipes so a good

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.120 
exercises short recipes so a good
example<00:06:36.460> is<00:06:37.120> you<00:06:38.080> can<00:06:38.200> start<00:06:38.410> doing<00:06:38.560> a<00:06:38.740> burpee

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
example is you can start doing a burpee

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.970 
example is you can start doing a burpee
you'll<00:06:39.970> do<00:06:40.090> six<00:06:40.330> reps<00:06:40.690> and<00:06:40.930> then<00:06:41.590> immediately

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
you'll do six reps and then immediately

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.610 
you'll do six reps and then immediately
drop<00:06:42.250> down<00:06:42.490> and<00:06:42.670> do<00:06:42.820> six<00:06:43.180> push-ups<00:06:43.630> okay<00:06:44.380> so<00:06:44.440> a

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
drop down and do six push-ups okay so a

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.680 
drop down and do six push-ups okay so a
burpee<00:06:45.070> and<00:06:45.670> of<00:06:45.730> course<00:06:45.880> you<00:06:46.060> can<00:06:46.210> modify<00:06:46.510> the

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
burpee and of course you can modify the

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.860 
burpee and of course you can modify the

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
push-ups then you go back to the Burpee

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.530 
push-ups then you go back to the Burpee
do<00:07:05.930> 5<00:07:06.290> reps<00:07:06.320> and<00:07:07.250> that<00:07:07.430> can<00:07:07.640> push<00:07:07.850> up<00:07:08.030> and<00:07:08.210> do<00:07:08.300> 5

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
reps for that basically work your way

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.490 
reps for that basically work your way
down<00:07:10.610> until<00:07:11.000> you<00:07:11.210> complete<00:07:11.570> one<00:07:11.900> ref<00:07:12.140> of<00:07:12.350> each

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
down until you complete one ref of each

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.530 
down until you complete one ref of each
exercise<00:07:12.710> and<00:07:13.280> that's<00:07:13.400> just<00:07:13.550> one<00:07:13.850> example<00:07:13.880> of

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:14.540 
exercise and that's just one example of

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.110 
exercise and that's just one example of
a<00:07:14.960> really<00:07:15.230> cool<00:07:15.440> metabolic<00:07:16.400> workout<00:07:16.700> finisher

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
a really cool metabolic workout finisher

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.120 
a really cool metabolic workout finisher
that<00:07:17.330> you<00:07:17.420> can<00:07:17.570> include<00:07:17.960> with<00:07:18.560> your<00:07:18.740> workouts

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.130

that you can include with your workouts
so<00:07:19.670> as<00:07:19.940> you<00:07:20.930> see<00:07:21.170> the<00:07:22.070> ideal<00:07:22.460> template<00:07:23.030> if<00:07:23.120> you

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
so as you see the ideal template if you

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.570 
so as you see the ideal template if you
will<00:07:23.390> is<00:07:23.600> the<00:07:24.140> warm<00:07:24.380> up<00:07:24.620> and<00:07:25.130> then<00:07:25.220> the

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
will is the warm up and then the

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.670 
will is the warm up and then the
metabolic<00:07:26.090> resistance<00:07:26.240> training<00:07:26.840> and<00:07:27.050> then

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
metabolic resistance training and then

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.810 
metabolic resistance training and then
the<00:07:27.770> conditioning<00:07:28.340> of<00:07:28.430> course<00:07:28.670> that's

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:28.820 
the conditioning of course that's

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.450 
the conditioning of course that's
optional<00:07:29.330> and<00:07:29.540> then<00:07:30.110> finally<00:07:30.590> end<00:07:30.830> it<00:07:30.950> with<00:07:31.130> a

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460 
optional and then finally end it with a

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.850 
optional and then finally end it with a
finisher<00:07:32.180> and<00:07:32.690> that<00:07:32.930> could<00:07:33.050> be<00:07:33.080> like<00:07:33.500> I<00:07:33.620> said

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
finisher and that could be like I said

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.250 
finisher and that could be like I said
just<00:07:34.040> like<00:07:34.580> I<00:07:34.730> showed<00:07:34.970> you<00:07:35.060> you<00:07:35.630> can<00:07:35.780> also<00:07:35.930> run

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.260 
just like I showed you you can also run

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.810 
just like I showed you you can also run
some<00:07:36.440> sprints<00:07:36.980> at<00:07:37.070> the<00:07:37.190> end<00:07:37.340> if<00:07:37.460> that's<00:07:37.640> what

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
some sprints at the end if that's what

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.180 
some sprints at the end if that's what
you<00:07:37.910> want<00:07:38.090> to<00:07:38.150> do<00:07:38.240> whatever<00:07:38.840> that<00:07:39.200> may<00:07:39.380> be<00:07:39.410> so
