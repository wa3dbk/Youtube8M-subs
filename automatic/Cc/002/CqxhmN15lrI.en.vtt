00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.450
The iPhone5S launch features a new fingerprint
sensor built into the home button to lock

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.730
and unlock your phone.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.330
nine million have already been shipped in
just a week and Americans are reportedly set

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.530
up their phone to be unlocked using their
tongues, cat's paws and in some cases their

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.880
nipples which doesn't sound very practical.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.840
But you would think using your fingerprint
to secure your phone which would be a really

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.440
smart solution.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.290
However within a day of the product launching
an organisation in Germany called the Chaos

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.480
Computer Club claimed that they hacked Apple's
touch ID system.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.710
So how did they go about doing this?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.090
Is it a hard thing to do?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.980
Well fingerprinting itself or Dactyloscopy
which is not easy to say and is worth 25 points

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.200
in scrabble is actually a really good way
of identifying people,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.800
it's better even than DNA which is shared
of course by identical twins.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.719
There have been no two people found with an
identical fingerprint.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.640
And the statistics suggest that there is a
1 in 64 billion chance of having the same

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.920
fingerprint as somebody else.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.470
Now most of our body is covered in smooth
skin, but it's just our hands and our feet

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.730
that have ridges over the entire surface and
that's thought to be to help the sense of

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.140
touch,
the feel of friction, but also to help us

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.830
grip things.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.900
And these ridges actually form in the womb,
so up until about 20 weeks, as we grow fingers

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.150
and nails the skin is forming these ridges,
and at 20 weeks it's fixed and those patters

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.799
stay with us for the rest of our lives.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.470
So if you were to look at your fingertips,
your finger print, you would likely see one

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.509
of three patterns.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.340
Firstly you might see an arch which is an
undulation in the ridges, secondly you might

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.080
see a loop and the loop might veer off towards
your thumb or slightly of towards your little

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080
finger.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.560
And the third feature to look for is a spiral
or a whorl, it's spelt WHORL.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.150
So if it's so hard to map and to see your
finger is so complicated, how did these guys

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.689
in Germany manage to hack the system?

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.219
Well they didn't chop anybody's finger off
and Apple are being very very careful to make

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.579
sure the technology wouldn't work if you tried
that.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.999
What they did do was manage to get hold of
an image of somebody's fingerprint.

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.680
Now what they say, their method, their claim
is as follows.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.840
If you get hold of an image you need to scan
it or take an image at a very high resolution

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.829
at 2400dpi, you then take the image and pass
it through something like photoshop, clean

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:52.819
it up, and invert the image, and then you
need to print it at 1200dpi on a lazier printer

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.590
with a very high toner thickness.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.680
If you print that on an acetate or something
with a shiny finish, you then as a final step

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.449
paint that with a latex or a PVA glue or something
that will set rubbery, leave it to dry, leave

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:14.540
it to set and then peel it off and you'll
have the undulations, the curve of the original

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.569
print,
if you place it on your finger you can then

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.739
place it on the phone, and you will unlock
the fingerprint sensor.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.829
And this has been shown on a number of videos
posted on YouTube by this organisation.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.779
Apple of course are fighting to keep up, I'm
sure they will come up with a solution to

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:37.109
that and we will keep our finger on the pulse
to make sure we're aware of any development

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.719
and we'll bring them to you and we will clean
our fingerprints off anything we've touched

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.719
in the meantime.
