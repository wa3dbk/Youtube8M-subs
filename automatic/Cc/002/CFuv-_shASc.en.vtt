plus<00:03:19.829> shipping<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.280> handling<00:03:20.449> so<00:03:21.449> it's<00:03:21.989> way

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
plus shipping and handling so it's way

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.619 
plus shipping and handling so it's way
less<00:03:22.829> expensive<00:03:23.459> than<00:03:23.609> sending<00:03:24.000> flowers
