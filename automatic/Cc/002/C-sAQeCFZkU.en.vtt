00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.150
 hello everyone I'm dan and I'm here 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 new in minecraft to bring you a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.349
 new section of the channel this section is going 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660
 to consist concretely in analysis of 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.400
 textures packages I will show you some 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.869
 images of the textures while you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.820
 I comment a little different information 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.000
 of the pack the three available solutions 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.360
 and my personal opinion so nothing 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.360
 to start 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.850
 today I bring you a package of textures 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.200
 called facebook many you will already know 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.120
 since it is the one that I use practically 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.590
 since I started the channel and to me 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.360
 personally he is one of those who most 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.490
 they already like that it maintains the essence of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.830
 original textures but with twice as many 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.860
 resolution concretely the resolution 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.580
 of this pack is 32 by 32 pixels and 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.580
 it is the only one available 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.300
 one of the things that I like most about 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.130
 This pack is its compatibility with 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.290
 mods and is that when using the textures 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.970
 originals but with higher resolution is 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.310
 easier to adapt the textures of the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.980
 mods is more though the textures of the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.470
 mods are at 16 by 16 pixels and the 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.640
 textures of minecraft have 32 with that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.140
 so the difference is not so 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.930
 striking as with other packages of 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.190
 textures with other packs like 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.990
 example docu craft that is pretty 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.150
 famous if you install a mod that does not 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.860
 has textures adapted to that pack going to 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.300
 everything is quite bad the envelopes do not 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.400
 they will look good and any other object 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.650
 block is not going to be well either 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.220
 however with this pack that happens in 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.220
 lesser measure 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.689
 On the other hand, comment that 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.549
 creators of this texture pack are 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.070
 quite active and update the pack 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.689
 very quickly in each version 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.970
 currently available for 1.3 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.770
 point 2 and offers support for many 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.310
 mods of both this version and the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.310
 previous 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.710
 Finally, comment that you also have 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.600
 available textures on the web page 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.430
 from minecraft customized where you can 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.930
 customize this pack by choosing between 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.930
 some alternative textures 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.709
 because nothing else that has been everything I hope 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.900
 that you liked this new section 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.819
 I will try to do it at least once 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.980
 week and nothing left you with the file 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.250
 technical a greeting and until the next 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.250
 video
