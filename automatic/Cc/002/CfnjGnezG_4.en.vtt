00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
towards that that to make it as the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
towards that that to make it as the
color<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.760> consistent<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:44.820> possible<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.239> even

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

just going to help the tool by clicking

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390 
just going to help the tool by clicking
on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> color<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.860> clicking<00:01:32.189> on

the<00:01:32.549> spot<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.850> i<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.420> best<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the spot that i think is best and I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.899 
the spot that i think is best and I
could<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.409> zoom<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.700> try

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
could just zoom in and really just try

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.910 
could just zoom in and really just try
to<00:01:35.970> find<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.390> color<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.530> best

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
to find that color that is the best

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.960 
to find that color that is the best
color<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:40.460> quite<00:01:41.460> happy<00:01:41.729> with

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
color and not and I'm quite happy with

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.819 
color and not and I'm quite happy with
the<00:01:42.509> way<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> pick

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the way it is you can see when I pick

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.109 
the way it is you can see when I pick
the<00:01:43.950> color<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> pick<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> color

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the color here when I pick the color

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
the color here when I pick the color
which<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.420> lighter<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.140> could<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> darker

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
which is lighter we could see the darker

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.340 
which is lighter we could see the darker
shadows<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> blue<00:01:47.909> shadows<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.200> got

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
shadows of the blue shadows but as I got

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.700 
shadows of the blue shadows but as I got
closer<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.189> found<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.850> balance<00:01:51.590> because<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
closer it found that balance because of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.950 
closer it found that balance because of
the<00:01:52.799> tolerance<00:01:53.280> level<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the tolerance level so now all I have to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
the tolerance level so now all I have to
do<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.829> closes<00:01:56.460> down<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
do now is I it closes down now that I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
do now is I it closes down now that I
picked<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.390> color<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.439> scream

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
picked a color I could just scream

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.039 
picked a color I could just scream
through<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.759> bit<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.840> all

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
through it a bit and just see that all

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.569 
through it a bit and just see that all
the<00:02:01.170> colors<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> are<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.860> getting<00:02:02.100> pixel

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the colors that are not getting pixel

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.580 
the colors that are not getting pixel
Asians<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.540> could<00:02:03.719> even<00:02:03.810> zoom<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.500> little

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
Asians and I could even zoom in a little

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
Asians and I could even zoom in a little
bit<00:02:04.740> more<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.729> wanted<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.390> try

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
bit more if I really wanted to just try

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
bit more if I really wanted to just try
to<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.990> sure<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.680> i<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> least

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to make sure that I'm i got the least

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.020 
to make sure that I'm i got the least
amount<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.270> pixilation<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
amount of pixilation that I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.520 
amount of pixilation that I
could<00:02:11.240> get<00:02:11.390> um<00:02:12.230> that's<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.950> great<00:02:13.190> photo<00:02:14.530> I'm

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
I had any issues I could have played

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.809 
I had any issues I could have played
with<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.290> white<00:02:21.500> ship<00:02:21.770> basically<00:02:21.980> playing

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
with the white ship basically playing

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.820 
with the white ship basically playing
around<00:02:23.150> with<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.660> with<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.140> configuration

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
around with the with the configuration

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.309 
around with the with the configuration
to<00:02:25.040> add<00:02:25.250> or<00:02:25.670> remove<00:02:25.819> more<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.870> tolerance

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
to add or remove more of that tolerance

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.890 
to add or remove more of that tolerance
to<00:02:27.650> white<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.040> overall<00:02:28.940> tolerance<00:02:29.540> itself

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
to white and overall tolerance itself

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.780 
to white and overall tolerance itself
and<00:02:30.110> change<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> angle<00:02:31.040> which<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.400> be<00:02:31.489> honest

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
and change the angle which to be honest

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.620 
and change the angle which to be honest
I<00:02:31.850> don't<00:02:31.940> really<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.300> what<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.510> difference

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
I don't really know what the difference

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.030 
I don't really know what the difference
is<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.020> know<00:02:33.110> all<00:02:33.170> these<00:02:33.260> three<00:02:33.470> are<00:02:33.530> all<00:02:33.980> I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
is you know all these three are all I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.620 
is you know all these three are all I
know<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.910> playing<00:02:35.209> with<00:02:35.330> them<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.600> bit

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
know is it just playing with them a bit

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.710 
know is it just playing with them a bit
gives<00:02:36.260> me<00:02:36.410> better<00:02:36.560> results<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.569> usually<00:02:38.569> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
gives me better results and usually the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.479 
gives me better results and usually the
default<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.440> application<00:02:39.920> gives<00:02:40.069> me<00:02:40.310> is

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
default that application gives me is

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.699 
default that application gives me is
quite<00:02:40.940> good<00:02:41.390> which<00:02:41.959> I'm<00:02:42.140> really<00:02:42.380> really

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
quite good which I'm really really

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.560 
quite good which I'm really really
surprised<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.370> wasn't<00:02:43.760> true<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.180> i<00:02:44.239> was<00:02:44.269> using

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
surprised it wasn't true and i was using

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.090 
surprised it wasn't true and i was using
a<00:02:44.750> green<00:02:44.989> screen<00:02:45.170> because<00:02:45.530> as<00:02:45.650> we<00:02:45.800> said<00:02:45.830> my

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
a green screen because as we said my

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.300 
a green screen because as we said my
skin<00:02:46.640> complexion<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.239> quite<00:02:47.510> green<00:02:47.900> and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
skin complexion is quite green and

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.040 
skin complexion is quite green and
because<00:02:49.310> my<00:02:49.459> eyes<00:02:49.610> are<00:02:49.750> relatively<00:02:50.750> green

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
because my eyes are relatively green

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.590 
because my eyes are relatively green
they're<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.620> dark<00:02:52.010> swampy<00:02:52.760> green<00:02:53.090> so

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
they're like this dark swampy green so

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.240 
they're like this dark swampy green so
just<00:02:53.840> green<00:02:54.050> doesn't<00:02:54.380> work<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:54.739> me<00:02:54.769> but<00:02:54.980> blue

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
just green doesn't work for me but blue

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.100 
just green doesn't work for me but blue
there's<00:02:55.519> just<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:55.940> much<00:02:56.060> no<00:02:56.239> blue<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.690> my<00:02:56.870> skin

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
there's just so much no blue in my skin

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.800 
there's just so much no blue in my skin
complexion<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.180> because<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.420> it's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
complexion and as because of that it's

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.410 
complexion and as because of that it's
really<00:03:00.140> not<00:03:00.290> easy<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.800> me<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.890> do<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.420> alright

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
really not easy for me to do a alright

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.479 
really not easy for me to do a alright
so<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.350> think<00:03:03.769> it's<00:03:03.890> time<00:03:04.010> for<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> jingle
