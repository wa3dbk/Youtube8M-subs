00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.239
 cvs 3 lanes too 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.239
 These two are one channel 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.820
 I can see my picture and cable TV 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.060
 Though 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.060
 I would like to write it all the month 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 The same seems to be a program of 1 tv 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.540
 These are the TV Tokyo affiliated tv 9 Kyushu broadcasters 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 but 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.920
 stb rear 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 This broadcast is three examples 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.910
 It can not be seen in small groups 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.970

 Maintenance and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.630
 this street 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.630
 You can watch the broadcast of the partnership 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.499
 Pick a holy place 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.969
 The reason why you can not see the concept is 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.909
 In a method called trans modulation 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.909
 Re-sending 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.340
 However, it agrees and the broadcast channel will change 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.379
 You can see the demonstration during the game in Xi'an 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:41.979
 However 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.059
 pbt Kyushu Broadcasting 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.240
 Trans modulation 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.429
 Because it is Shan 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.429
 If you do not use the stb set top box 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.979
 I can not claim a concept 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.099
 Also cs broadcast 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 It is tv and can be seen as usual 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.349
 I have a tuner built in 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.529
 Because it is marketed, it can not be seen during the game 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.529
 is 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.329
