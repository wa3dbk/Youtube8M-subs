00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.599
 Tokyo, Japan 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.090
 Good guys so I'm here today with 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.700
 the night and guys dance another one 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.700
 angels channel video pf 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.220
 People, I have an important warning here. 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.820
 for you guys why is it that my 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.640
 hardcore games is rebuilding the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.160
 that he had many bugs and 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 There's another reason I do not know. 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.450
 if you will know more 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.940
 recently the mojang the creator of 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.630
 minecraft updated the terms of service 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.240
 ie the craft europe maine and this 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.729
 new update was messed up 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.800
 the minecraft servers because 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.740
 generally I think you are 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.869
 accustomed to go out to hg servers 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.990
 most of the servers had the kits 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.130
 for example kit daemon said rich gold 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.160
 this things 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.009
 and such kits for example of people is 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.729
 were of these kits they had many 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.550
 advantages Mozambique is now for whom 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.459
 buy vip can not have more so many 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.259
 benefits and benefits that hinder 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.479
 people's gameplay 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.940
 for example if the VIPs have access to a 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.700
 all other people will have to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.670
 have access to this same kit is why 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.780
 that we are in this last months had 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.759
 removed what hurts and puts you 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.369
 some advantages for people 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.119
 can get involved globe conserve 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.390
 full 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.240
 but it is with these advantages that we do not 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.610
 was able to achieve the amount of 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.080
 donation you need to keep the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.420
 online server 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.700
 Good people then with this new one. 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.040
 update of the terms of mother jane 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.040
 we are creating a new system of 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.010
 vips here on the server and so he 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.849
 will be under reconstruction in these next 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.790
 weeks 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.860
 I'm going to post a video on the channel when 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.050
 we finish reconfiguring the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.880
 server and when you have everything ready 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.370
 We 'll even go back with Serbia. 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.190
 and I wish I could show you the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.650
 what are we setting up is going to have 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.860
 a personal pro shop bar system 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.220
 power that is to buy the kits but in 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.200
 these kits here is a 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.260
 Little power to buy with money in the game 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.420
 and I'll explain very well now that the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.280
 people arrive at the time to set up and 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.590
 not sure how it's going 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.860
 operate this new system 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.260
 but for example it is here we also 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.750
 is setting up the new biome sou 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.510
 As you can see here the mega taiga 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.180
 have the table today are setting 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.520
 the server if in general for the biomes 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.320
 Fixed bugs 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.990
 we leave the service like this 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.220
 way everyone wants a 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.160
 hge 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.950
 Good guys so this was the video I hope 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.380
 that you do not get so upset 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.480
 because the server will come back, we will not 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.030
 has an estimate of when 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.910
 he will come back but he will come back in 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.690
 brief the galera then that is it if it dispenses 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.860
