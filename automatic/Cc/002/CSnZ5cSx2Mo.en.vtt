00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.160
 our expedition ships ms hanseatic 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 and ms bremen offer a form of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.470
 modern adventure paired with comfort 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.270
 in a high experience the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.610
 possibility is given to us by the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.820
 Ship construction the ships have 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.770
 maximum draft of 4.8 meters, the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.880
 maximum length the hanseatic to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.880
 example of 123 meters of course ours 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.530
 on-board zodiac and very important for 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.680
 us the highest ice class for 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.539
 passenger ships and together with the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.809
 combination of experienced crew highest 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.379
 comfort on board and a competent 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.719
 We have the experts team 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.500
 possibilities destinations routes too 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.199
 cruise 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.190
 the other really undeveloped 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.200
 stay in the Pacific Micronesia 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.670
 we the Carolines and the Marshall 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.440
 visit islands 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.170
 we will be with the bremen this year 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.180
 the amazon boot not only into 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.619
 kitas no we drive 70 nautical miles 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.619
 continue to uta 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.050
 the special with new driving areas 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 we discover and travel new ones 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.550
 we always do that we are not 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.260
 on experiences of our own ship 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.850
 or other vessels 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.560
 so it's always a premiere 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.870
 that we are always on the move as a pioneer 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.120
 and that you then first of all 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.030
 resort to completely different sources 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.400
 must and sometimes that is already 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.960
 internet is that you can just look 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.580
 maybe some other time 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.520
 There was also a country 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.070
 excursion or with sailing ships one 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.470
 sounds around you collect information 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.610
 of people in any way and 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.170
 maybe already been there 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.760
 are and for me that means 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.740
 captain that you first of all 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.820
 trying to optimize the timetable 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.580
 that you are talking about the individual 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.140
 informed and that is yes 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.730
 no cities in the classical sense in 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.980
 an expedition trip are the areas 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 Landings somewhere in the tower on one 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.030
 lonely island where you maybe animals 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.590
 can see or where you are in a village 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.600
 lands and is welcomed there 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.800
 and this detail planning in 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.770
 cooperation with ours 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.080
 expedition leader is because the made 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.130
 The journey is closer, for example , we are planning 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.410
 summer 2014 with the hanseatic to all 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.030
 first time the northeast passage to 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.320
 This is the route through the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.790
 russian arctic 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.390
 We can do that to our guests in this 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.390
 offer summer 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.870
 an area of activity at hapag lloyd 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:06.319
 Cruises is the route planning 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.329
 I try for each ship 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.480
 to design individual routes 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.030
 in principle, the first one shares 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.859
 actually the whole year for the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.569
 expedition ships in single 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.180
 routes and there begins 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.340
 actually already the first problem in 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.220
 We also hold new destinations or 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.670
 new itineraries plan like that 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.709
 northeast passage that of course a giant 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.769
 The challenge there is not just that 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.560
 An important house also that that 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.120
 prevailing weather and you have to 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.540
 think carefully before when to 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.159
 These journeys are planned with it 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.299
 the respective product managers 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.730
 agreed and together we try 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.450
 then every year actually the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.450
 to discover the world
