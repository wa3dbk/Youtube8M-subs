to come out and it's going to be eight
by<00:03:29.109> twenty<00:03:29.530> four<00:03:29.739> we<00:03:29.889> didn't<00:03:30.129> do<00:03:30.220> thirty-nine

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
by twenty four we didn't do thirty-nine

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.349 
by twenty four we didn't do thirty-nine
because<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:31.269> don't<00:03:31.449> have<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.629> lot<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.870> time

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.330 

so<00:03:34.720> remember<00:03:35.340> darkroom<00:03:36.340> 9.2<00:03:37.409> has<00:03:38.409> a<00:03:38.440> built-in

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
so remember darkroom 9.2 has a built-in

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.849 
so remember darkroom 9.2 has a built-in
driver<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.479> nice<00:03:40.720> thing<00:03:41.019> about<00:03:41.049> having<00:03:41.319> the

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
driver the nice thing about having the

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.520 
driver the nice thing about having the
built<00:03:42.069> in<00:03:42.310> driver<00:03:42.639> is<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.659> can<00:03:43.840> do<00:03:43.959> all<00:03:44.199> these

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
built in driver is you can do all these

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.369 
built in driver is you can do all these
different<00:03:44.859> sizes<00:03:45.780> through<00:03:46.780> one<00:03:47.019> driver

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
different sizes through one driver

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.479 
different sizes through one driver
versus<00:03:48.069> having<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.489> load<00:03:48.699> multiple<00:03:49.329> drivers

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
versus having to load multiple drivers

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.300 
versus having to load multiple drivers
and<00:03:51.870> our<00:03:52.870> last<00:03:53.139> print<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.620> coming<00:03:53.769> out<00:03:53.949> you<00:03:54.129> can

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
and our last print is coming out you can

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.860 
and our last print is coming out you can
see<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.609> printer<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:57.870> printing

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
see the printer it's printing

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.699 
see the printer it's printing
exceptionally<00:03:59.560> fast<00:03:59.799> I<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:00.220> 8<00:04:00.879> by<00:04:01.090> 10<00:04:01.359> was<00:04:01.659> a

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
exceptionally fast I the 8 by 10 was a

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:11.300 
exceptionally fast I the 8 by 10 was a
prints<00:04:02.709> out<00:04:02.889> in<00:04:03.010> 30<00:04:03.250> seconds

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.360 

so<00:04:11.880> if<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.150> have<00:04:12.360> dark<00:04:12.630> room<00:04:13.069> you<00:04:14.069> can<00:04:14.220> always

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
so if you have dark room you can always

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.280 
so if you have dark room you can always
call<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:14.819> an<00:04:15.000> upgrade<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.390> if<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.079> want

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
call this an upgrade that if you want

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.870 
call this an upgrade that if you want
the<00:04:16.440> direct<00:04:16.680> driver<00:04:17.040> if<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.489> it's<00:04:17.700> got<00:04:17.820> a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
the direct driver if not it's got a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.420 
the direct driver if not it's got a
regular<00:04:18.150> Windows<00:04:18.690> driver<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.769> can<00:04:20.190> print

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
regular Windows driver so you can print

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.210 
regular Windows driver so you can print
out<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:20.959> anything<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.350> accepts<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.860> Windows

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
out of anything that accepts a Windows

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.700 
out of anything that accepts a Windows
driver<00:04:26.300> okay<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.870> package<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.410> just

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
driver okay so the package I just

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.250 
driver okay so the package I just
printed<00:04:29.070> out<00:04:29.190> you've<00:04:29.940> got<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.419> 8<00:04:30.780> by<00:04:31.110> 24<00:04:33.260> you've

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
printed out you've got a 8 by 24 you've
