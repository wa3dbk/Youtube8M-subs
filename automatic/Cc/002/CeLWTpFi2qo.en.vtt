and I'm cautious I'm cautiously
optimistic<00:03:17.010> about<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.420> game<00:03:18.690> I've<00:03:19.020> heard<00:03:19.260> a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
optimistic about this game I've heard a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.230 
optimistic about this game I've heard a
lot<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.400> people<00:03:20.490> seem<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.730> be<00:03:20.850> upset<00:03:20.970> that

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
lot of people seem to be upset that

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.550 
lot of people seem to be upset that
there's<00:03:21.390> no<00:03:21.480> campaign<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.200> when<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.410> really

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
there's no campaign but when you really

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.200 
there's no campaign but when you really
think<00:03:22.650> about<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.220> campaign<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.000> first

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
think about it the campaign in the first

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.490 
think about it the campaign in the first
and<00:03:24.390> second<00:03:24.780> gate<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.900> can't<00:03:25.140> even<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.440> don't

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
and second gate I can't even I don't

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.930 
and second gate I can't even I don't
think<00:03:25.590> there<00:03:25.800> was<00:03:26.040> one<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.340> first<00:03:26.520> game<00:03:26.730> I

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
think there was one in the first game I

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.190 
think there was one in the first game I
can't<00:03:27.330> remember<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.750> second<00:03:28.110> one

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
can't remember but the second one

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.170 
can't remember but the second one
definitely<00:03:28.860> did<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.670> was<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> wasn't

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
definitely did and I was a it wasn't

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.670 
definitely did and I was a it wasn't
really<00:03:30.390> anything<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.900> was<00:03:31.020> just<00:03:31.170> kind<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.440> I

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
really anything it was just kind of I

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.020 
really anything it was just kind of I
appreciated<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.490> was<00:03:32.610> there<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:32.850> I

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
appreciated that it was there and I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.370 
appreciated that it was there and I
played<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.420> lot<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.960> was<00:03:34.110> pretty<00:03:34.260> much

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
played it a lot but it was pretty much

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.350 
played it a lot but it was pretty much
just<00:03:34.440> multiplayer<00:03:35.130> but<00:03:35.400> with<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.670> little<00:03:36.120> tiny

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
just multiplayer but with a little tiny

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.540 
just multiplayer but with a little tiny
bit<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.660> context<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.500> would<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.100> personally

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
bit of context I would I personally

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.950 
bit of context I would I personally
would<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.730> been<00:03:38.820> fine<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.240> that<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.630> in

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
would have been fine with that and in

would have been fine with that and in
the<00:03:40.530> new<00:03:40.650> one<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.280> understand<00:03:41.760> why<00:03:41.850> it's

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the new one but I understand why it's

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.190 
the new one but I understand why it's
not<00:03:42.060> gonna<00:03:42.180> be<00:03:42.330> in<00:03:42.420> there<00:03:42.570> because<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.020> just

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
not gonna be in there because it's just

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.170 
not gonna be in there because it's just
it's<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.770> it's<00:03:44.250> just<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.520> waste<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.120> time

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
it's just on it's just a waste of time

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.970 
it's just on it's just a waste of time

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
have it in there in the first place when

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.350 
have it in there in the first place when
they<00:03:49.710> announced<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.220> was<00:03:50.340> not<00:03:50.550> surprised<00:03:51.030> in

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360

adepts away why force me to do it people
seem<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.400> be<00:03:56.580> arguing<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.180> plucking<00:03:57.570> all

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
seem to be arguing and plucking all

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.090 
seem to be arguing and plucking all
these<00:03:57.780> comparisons<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.590> things<00:03:58.800> out<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:58.980> the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
these comparisons and things out of the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.100 
these comparisons and things out of the
air<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.700> not<00:03:59.880> it's<00:04:00.420> not<00:04:00.570> fair

I<00:04:01.140> think<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.380> mentioned<00:04:01.620> earlier<00:04:01.890> gains<00:04:02.070> are

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
I think I mentioned earlier gains are

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.430 
I think I mentioned earlier gains are
far<00:04:02.430> more<00:04:02.460> expensive<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:03.180> make<00:04:03.690> now<00:04:04.020> when<00:04:04.380> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
far more expensive to make now when you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.720 
far more expensive to make now when you
really<00:04:04.650> think<00:04:04.890> about<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.190> maps<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.520> were<00:04:05.640> in

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
really think about the maps that were in

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.950 
really think about the maps that were in
the<00:04:05.820> old<00:04:05.970> games<00:04:06.210> it<00:04:06.390> was<00:04:06.510> cool<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.810> they<00:04:06.900> were

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
the old games it was cool that they were

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.300 
the old games it was cool that they were
loads<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.350> them<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:07.740> were<00:04:07.830> lots<00:04:08.220> of

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
loads of them and there were lots of

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.680 
loads of them and there were lots of
different<00:04:08.670> ones<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:08.970> stuff<00:04:09.150> but<00:04:09.570> there

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
different ones and stuff but there

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.240 
different ones and stuff but there
wasn't<00:04:09.840> really<00:04:09.990> that<00:04:10.140> much<00:04:10.350> going<00:04:10.860> on<00:04:11.070> with

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
wasn't really that much going on with

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.980 
wasn't really that much going on with
them<00:04:11.460> really<00:04:11.850> they<00:04:12.390> were<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.660> kind<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.870> like

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
them really they were just kind of like

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.740 
them really they were just kind of like
skins<00:04:13.470> for<00:04:14.460> a<00:04:14.490> big<00:04:14.730> rectangle<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.600> ran

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
skins for a big rectangle that you ran

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.510 
skins for a big rectangle that you ran
around<00:04:15.900> they<00:04:16.380> weren't<00:04:16.530> really<00:04:16.620> interactive

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
around they weren't really interactive
