four Dino bots RESCUE BOTS I already

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.090 
four Dino bots RESCUE BOTS I already
have<00:00:18.480> two<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.840> them<00:00:18.990> open<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.650> let's<00:00:19.859> check

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
have two of them open so let's check

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.090 
have two of them open so let's check
them<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.369> here<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.119> blades<00:00:21.539> he<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.560> transform

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
them out here is blades he can transform

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.730 
them out here is blades he can transform
into<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.580> pterodactyl<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.600> he<00:00:25.199> also<00:00:25.380> has<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
into a pterodactyl and he also has a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.320 
into a pterodactyl and he also has a
button<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.250> his<00:00:26.369> back<00:00:26.430> they'll<00:00:26.880> make<00:00:27.150> his

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
button on his back they'll make his

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:38.209 
button on his back they'll make his
wings<00:00:27.660> flap<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:35.930> here<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.079> heatwave<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> he

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
wings flap and here is heatwave and he

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
wings flap and here is heatwave and he
transforms<00:00:38.850> into<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> brontosaurus<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
transforms into a brontosaurus but I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.530 
transforms into a brontosaurus but I
have<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> problem<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.489> heatwave<00:00:41.760> his

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
have a problem with this heatwave his

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.930 
have a problem with this heatwave his
spring<00:00:42.989> mechanism<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.710> damaged<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.340> he<00:00:44.789> will

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
spring mechanism is damaged and he will

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
spring mechanism is damaged and he will
not<00:00:45.090> stay<00:00:45.450> transformed<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
not stay transformed so I'm going to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.119 
not stay transformed so I'm going to
have<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> new<00:00:47.670> one

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.979 

here's<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.250> new<00:00:52.520> heat<00:00:52.820> wave<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.300> let's<00:00:53.660> see<00:00:53.840> how

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
here's a new heat wave and let's see how

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.360 
here's a new heat wave and let's see how
he<00:00:54.050> should<00:00:54.170> transform<00:00:54.829> when<00:00:55.129> working

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
he should transform when working

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.150 
he should transform when working
properly<00:00:59.140> he<00:01:00.140> also<00:01:00.260> has<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.590> button<00:01:00.890> on<00:01:01.070> his

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
properly he also has a button on his

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.670 
properly he also has a button on his
back<00:01:01.220> that<00:01:01.820> makes<00:01:02.059> his<00:01:02.239> head<00:01:02.449> slam<00:01:02.840> down

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.670 

this<00:01:09.670> new<00:01:09.910> heatwave<00:01:10.330> transforms<00:01:11.020> much<00:01:11.320> better

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
this new heatwave transforms much better

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:27.010 
this new heatwave transforms much better
and<00:01:11.830> he<00:01:12.100> actually<00:01:12.280> stays<00:01:12.730> transformed

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.200 

okay<00:01:28.020> here's<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.500> new<00:01:28.710> chase<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.399> Dinobot<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
okay here's a new chase the Dinobot that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.450 
okay here's a new chase the Dinobot that
transforms<00:01:30.869> into<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.259> Stegosaurus<00:01:32.250> very<00:01:33.030> cool

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.580 

watch<00:01:38.460> how<00:01:38.700> he<00:01:38.759> transforms<00:01:39.569> he<00:01:39.960> transforms

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
watch how he transforms he transforms

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
watch how he transforms he transforms
just<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> little<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:41.729> than<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
just a little bit different than the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:18.809 
just a little bit different than the
others

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.330 

he<00:02:19.819> can<00:02:20.000> also<00:02:20.209> slam<00:02:20.780> his<00:02:21.050> spiketail<00:02:21.709> down<00:02:22.069> if

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
he can also slam his spiketail down if

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:34.110 
he can also slam his spiketail down if
he<00:02:22.370> pushed<00:02:22.790> down<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.360> his<00:02:23.780> top<00:02:24.110> spikes<00:02:32.680> and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
he pushed down on his top spikes and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.540 
he pushed down on his top spikes and
here<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.270> Boulder<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.080> rescue<00:02:36.500> Dinobot<00:02:37.069> he

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
here is Boulder the rescue Dinobot he

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.240 
here is Boulder the rescue Dinobot he
transforms<00:02:38.209> into<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.600> triceratops

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.660 

if<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.720> push<00:02:45.930> down<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.200> his<00:02:46.470> tail<00:02:46.740> he<00:02:47.250> will<00:02:47.370> Ram

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
if you push down on his tail he will Ram

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.740 
if you push down on his tail he will Ram
his<00:02:47.970> head<00:02:48.210> forward

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
his head forward

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.870 
his head forward
very<00:02:49.140> cool<00:02:54.860> Boulder<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.220> trickiest<00:02:56.640> to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
very cool Boulder is the trickiest to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.820 
very cool Boulder is the trickiest to
transform<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.990> have<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.290> use<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> little

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
transform and you have to use a little

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.470 
transform and you have to use a little
more<00:02:59.010> force<00:02:59.460> than<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> others

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
more force than the others

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.840 
more force than the others
the<00:03:00.960> two<00:03:01.170> little<00:03:01.320> tabs<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.070> side<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.640> to

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
the two little tabs on the side have to

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.020 
the two little tabs on the side have to
be<00:03:02.940> unsnapped<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.870> transform<00:03:04.440> them

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.149 

so<00:03:09.030> after<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.540> unsnap<00:03:10.110> them<00:03:10.290> watch<00:03:10.769> how<00:03:11.010> his

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
so after you unsnap them watch how his

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:18.369 
so after you unsnap them watch how his
body<00:03:11.370> kind<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.909> slides<00:03:12.269> forward<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.170> up

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.930 

Boulder<00:03:19.379> is<00:03:19.590> probably<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.129> weirdest<00:03:20.549> looking

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
Boulder is probably the weirdest looking

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:39.809 
Boulder is probably the weirdest looking
after<00:03:21.480> he<00:03:21.629> is<00:03:21.720> transformed<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.650> robot<00:03:23.069> mode

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.970
