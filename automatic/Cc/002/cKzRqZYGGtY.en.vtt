you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.439> change<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> FaceTime<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you can change it to a FaceTime but

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
you can change it to a FaceTime but
other<00:01:27.030> than<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.299> you're<00:01:27.600> pretty<00:01:27.810> much<00:01:27.869> stuck

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
other than that you're pretty much stuck

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
other than that you're pretty much stuck
with<00:01:28.380> those<00:01:28.560> two<00:01:28.740> options<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.729> also<00:01:29.880> hide

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
with those two options you can also hide

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
with those two options you can also hide
the<00:01:30.450> section<00:01:30.840> headers<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> hide<00:01:31.650> search<00:01:32.009> bar

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the section headers and hide search bar

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
the section headers and hide search bar
so<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:33.930> cool<00:01:34.110> tweak

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so all in all it's a really cool tweak

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.830 
so all in all it's a really cool tweak
and<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.560> definitely<00:01:34.920> recommend<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.840> always
