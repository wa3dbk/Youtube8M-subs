00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:40.570 

change<00:01:25.340> your<00:01:25.490> shadows

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.880 

you<00:01:41.120> can<00:01:41.300> also<00:01:41.480> do<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:41.990> with<00:01:42.050> hue<00:01:42.710> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
you can also do this with hue and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.660 
you can also do this with hue and
saturation<00:01:42.970> which<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:45.530> generally<00:01:46.280> use<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.460> lot

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
saturation which I generally use a lot

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.660 
saturation which I generally use a lot
more<00:01:46.880> than<00:01:46.940> color<00:01:47.390> balance<00:01:48.370> because<00:01:49.370> it<00:01:49.490> just

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
more than color balance because it just

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.840 
more than color balance because it just
makes<00:01:50.120> it<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.300> little<00:01:50.330> bit<00:01:50.630> better<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.700> it

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
makes it a little bit better and it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:02.650 
makes it a little bit better and it
makes<00:01:52.880> him<00:01:53.150> look<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.420> lot<00:01:53.540> cooler<00:01:59.020> see<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:01.660> just

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
makes him look a lot cooler see I just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.930 
makes him look a lot cooler see I just
gotta<00:02:03.020> play<00:02:03.230> around<00:02:03.560> with<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:03.860> what<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:04.580> want
