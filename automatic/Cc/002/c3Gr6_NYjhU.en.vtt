00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.810
 last month he stumbles upon gabriela 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.510
 they depart 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.510
 the history of the clash of salt paulo 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.049
 I think I do not invent works for an explosion. 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.320
 every time people 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.569
 juxtaposes two works 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.819
 there is a process of curation 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.419
 somehow 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.760
 its interpretation process 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.630
 the process of aesthetic condemnation 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.630
 other process 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.610
 exposure of another 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.510
 stéphane is that they greet the visitor 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.470
 upon entering the exhibition 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.010
 being she 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.350
 the trajectory of the Brazilian smart lois 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.480
 here are two moments of this trajectory 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.840
 the first is a view of the city in these 21 a little to see 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.840
 is a magazine of são paulo in the time of the independence that is a little before 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.650
 surely this image 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 is almost like the certificate sexagenarian south of são paulo 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.820
 and at the same time linked to this period of the week 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.050
 of independence 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.450
 on the other side we have an abstract work 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.650
 the painter 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.560
 Sao Paulo, Brazil 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.620
 today we realize for example 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.240
 a sensuality of the way he 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.570
 deals with materiality at the same time as there is an order 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179
 in these parallel 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.030
 is here 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 by bringing in a looser dimension in brushstrokes the reason for placing 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.270
 Sergio sister started that paulo 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.810
 it's a symbolic reason 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 this is a painting silva is often done são paulo as the city 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.690
 was a day 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.180
 we lack more to the bright months 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.719
 It's okay, this is how it's taken soon. Maluhy came out on Tuesday. 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.719
 first impression 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.529
 the coming of the royal family 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.449
 to brazil and to the constitution 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:24.609
 the United Kingdom 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.899
 portugal brazil and algarves 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:31.329
 demanded also in the presence of this purposeful court wants rio de janeiro 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.499
 of artists capable of producing 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:36.209
 marta paintings 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.249
 Details 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.739
 all that a curtain 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.869
 in the study delivered this was the worst needy 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.869
 is that the artists coming 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.449
 which was also to create an art academy 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:50.509
 in Brazil 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.669
 I was 20 with the home that works on the planet. 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.230
 who perhaps was at that moment the most important artist of the americas 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.049
 this picture 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.089
 is a favela from rio de janeiro 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.229
 It's at the beginning of the 19th century we have there 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.659
 a guideline of the light of the classic or if we repair this landscape is punctuated 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.300
 by incidence of luiz 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.959
 It's a light that comes from the sky is a luís 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.109
 daytime 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.519
 There are clouds, we realize that. 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.219
 but the way light strikes 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.170
 it is extremely accurate time of a classic royal staff 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.329
 the neoclassical 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.279
 movement to be 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.629
 linked to domain xvi 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.649
 and in the enlightenment Louis represented was a metaphor for proposing and cementing 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:44.609
 did you already bring the accommodation 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.439
 positive light here 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.880
 he was assiduous of truth and good 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.709
 in the previous imaginary 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.309
 but in the Enlightenment it is very much bound up with knowledge 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.439
 because this relationship enter 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.889
 two and knowledge is not the classic 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.779
 will appear in the recent production of an artist são paulo haven cent 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.199
 but we see this column formed by books and theirs 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.279
 renters driven to rise as if it were a flame 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.849
 and at the same time we perceive this relationship 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.050
 two forms called the physical elimination of life and books as 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.809
 lighting in exchange for knowledge 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.770
 but we'll see later 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.840
 three artists that if it would represent the end 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.840
 the first results of this category formed in Brazil 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.389
 here we have a cascade tried by araújo in portalegre 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.669
 one of the first intellectuals 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.360
 art in Brazil and also wrote a critique of 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.779
 but we realize 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.569
 that there is here a certain italianization changed urban landscape 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.560
 a form that refers us to certain relations stated dark contrast 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.979
 but also if this is what is almost a heaven in the collection in the 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.210
 which marked precisely the passage 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.099
 from portalegre 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:07.550
 through italy
