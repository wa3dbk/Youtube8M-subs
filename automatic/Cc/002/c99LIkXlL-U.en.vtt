00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
pack so it's much lighter weight than

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.780 
pack so it's much lighter weight than
what<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> maybe<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.530> used<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.460> it

what you maybe are used to right now it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
what you maybe are used to right now it
is<00:01:12.150> extremely<00:01:12.900> lightweight<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> battery

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
is extremely lightweight for a battery

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280 
is extremely lightweight for a battery

quickly I took this blast pack for a
test<00:01:26.610> drive<00:01:26.700> very<00:01:27.090> recently<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.990> used<00:01:28.770> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
test drive very recently and used it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
test drive very recently and used it
with<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.250> quantum<00:01:30.060> light<00:01:30.420> which<00:01:30.810> are

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
with my quantum light which are

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.920 
with my quantum light which are
notoriously<00:01:31.680> juice<00:01:32.009> hungry<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.270> got<00:01:33.600> great

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
notoriously juice hungry and I got great

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899
