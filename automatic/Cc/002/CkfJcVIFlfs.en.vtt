00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040

dolled<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.660> false<00:00:34.020> lashes<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.860> these

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
dolled up I have false lashes on these

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.000 
dolled up I have false lashes on these
are<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.000> favorite<00:00:36.420> false<00:00:36.840> lashes<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
are one of my favorite false lashes and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.430 
are one of my favorite false lashes and
they<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.850> Andrea<00:00:41.850> mod<00:00:42.239> lash<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.290> these

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
they are the Andrea mod lash and these

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.880 
they are the Andrea mod lash and these
are<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> hundred<00:00:43.920> percent<00:00:44.129> human<00:00:45.000> hair<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.890> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
are a hundred percent human hair and so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.119 
are a hundred percent human hair and so
they're<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.520> lash<00:00:48.000> number<00:00:48.660> 21<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.800> will<00:00:49.980> try

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
they're in lash number 21 and I will try

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
they're in lash number 21 and I will try
to<00:00:50.219> come<00:00:50.550> closer<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.539> see<00:00:51.780> they're

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
to come closer so you can see they're

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.580 
to come closer so you can see they're
just<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:53.180> natural<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.570> look<00:00:54.899> fake

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
just very natural they don't look fake

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
just very natural they don't look fake
or<00:00:55.829> anything<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.090> they're<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.690> as

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
or anything just because they're not as

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.319 
or anything just because they're not as
long<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.710> most<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> false<00:00:59.670> lashes<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
long as most of the false lashes that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.049 
long as most of the false lashes that
are<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.989> there<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.699> look<00:01:02.820> very

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
