ago<00:02:05.210> they<00:02:06.020> came<00:02:06.200> down<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.070> back<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.280> check

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
ago they came down to the back and check

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.080 
ago they came down to the back and check
the<00:02:07.940> leather<00:02:08.180> and<00:02:08.510> it<00:02:09.470> was<00:02:09.680> very<00:02:10.070> flexible<00:02:10.820> and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090

here's the belt the back of the bill and
you<00:03:49.099> see<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:50.530> normal<00:03:51.530> replica

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
you see like that normal replica

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.869 
you see like that normal replica
wouldn't<00:03:52.219> stay<00:03:52.370> like<00:03:52.609> that<00:03:52.819> Oh<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:55.579> truly

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
wouldn't stay like that Oh it truly

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:02.439 
wouldn't stay like that Oh it truly
wouldn't<00:03:56.269> and<00:03:56.540> then<00:03:56.569> you<00:03:58.870> see<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.969> you<00:04:01.969> see<00:04:02.000> I

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
wouldn't and then you see that you see I

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.259 
wouldn't and then you see that you see I
could<00:04:02.840> fold<00:04:03.049> it<00:04:03.230> like<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:03.590> see<00:04:04.099> I<00:04:04.129> stays<00:04:04.609> norm

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
could fold it like that see I stays norm

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.420 
could fold it like that see I stays norm
replica<00:04:05.750> probably<00:04:06.199> go<00:04:06.290> like<00:04:06.469> that<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.919> put<00:04:07.370> it

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
replica probably go like that you put it

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.270 
replica probably go like that you put it
right<00:04:07.489> here<00:04:07.549> to<00:04:07.790> go<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.799> this<00:04:09.980> will<00:04:10.159> be
