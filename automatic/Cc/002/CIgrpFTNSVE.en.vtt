 and well hello to all and cyril others 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.119
 julia holes for the ninth episode of 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.820
 the series the demi-god is with us on 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.020
 will start with a match the goal of 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.390
 day is to win 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.520
 division 8 that's it I said to myself 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.500
 am given three matches 6 3 simon won 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.290
 three matches we will have the title of 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.540
 division 8 so in accelerated gesture and the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.100
 hap version of henderson listening to 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.880
 his credit of 2 more than the judgment of that 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.380
 the black card 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.270
 so I had a little pleasure 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.100
 you have to do one more level 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.950
 long I see I'm shooting you where I got you 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.020
 did an episode with three games but 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.250
 it is short-bah is not my fault 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.910
 in any case what to start with an evil 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.890
 so I want is to find an opponent 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.829
 who will have as you can see already 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.870
 kangaroos and jerseys etc 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.119
 logos of big clubs, saying yes 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.150
 it can be a big illusion 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.740
 team we'll see we'll see that he's new 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.000
 guy there that made me a little scared on the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.399
 paper it's true that there are still 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.460
 big players keep a mouth varane 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.590
 of benzema ramos 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.280
 modric which led them to say in a nutshell these 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.580
 not too much understood games di maria we like 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.990
 it's a bit odd we have that everything 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.310
 will start well from here it's better to 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.979
 stalin game that made the pass to 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.810
 gouffran gouffran hop turns around and the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.610
 look here a beautiful years rolled 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.500
 under the bar frankly order me 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.880
 really amazed because scoring 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.350
 goals like that it's beautiful and more 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.650
 to write locker is awesome at the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.240
 28th balleux of kylie on the kelly side 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.010
 who will center for the head of gouffran 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.770
 look at the little pole coming in here 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.119
 two to zero perfectly well 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.979
 frankly that's what we needed 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.150
 we need victories so it's going 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.869
 do what we wake up and you go 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.479
 to see how nice it is to score 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.020
 purpose but here's what to watch hop small 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.570
 start 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.270
 what made acid laugh not sure 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.640
 that yes a little rage that go out it's 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.349
 gone for the second game little does the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.610
 world but would mount as 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.530
 shells should be they are a 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.020
 team that there was a good a beautiful 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.380
 possible to 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.440
 standing shovel here we see robin's purpose 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.090
 van persie at the 20th his wife is 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.440
 perfect launched deep a beautiful 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.790
 feint van persie quietly on this 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.860
 train that is so watched the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.090
 big hit I would not remove the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.380
 light effects that has a lot of people 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.030
 who even love young hakim not me 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.640
 I like the game and would be in the middle 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.930
 time 9 matches nine shots and 8 shots 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.450
 for me really a big fat 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.160
 domination in the second period is not going to 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.500
 spend a lot of things aside at the 91st 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.060
 that having an action his side has neither 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.680
 will center for the explosive head eto'o 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.290
 who controls and who is his little dish 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.240
 from the foot of busan to the 90th do you 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.710
 do not worry about the match and of course 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.410
 so win man of the match van persie 1 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.240
 frankly the head van persie and 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.580
 gouffran it is very very bad so 500 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.830
 credits and here we will attack the last 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.530
 match of this episode for the title of 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.600
 division goal I made an investment 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.410
 seems to me now we see yes I have 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.880
 bought chicharrito I paid 1000 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.220
 miles credit I believe in the 1100 I know 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.230
 the more I have a pleasure is that I have not 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.630
 flight to the jury that the more 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.310
 gouges contracts sold them and for 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.110
 supply gouffran when the tired 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.970
 melt striker and I took 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.270
 just weave like that it will make a 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.320
 little green line with exaltation slap 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.870
 we can see we need the three 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.890
 points to win the 4000 credit the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.300
 division that would still be a lot 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.310
 since the credit level is a bit 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.420
 in galley it's true that it's the only one 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.490
 player that I brought is van persie 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.780
 the rest is that finally I spend that 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.910
 what I win so it's still 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.550
 not bad it's difficult so it's true 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.290
 so we see for last matches this 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.520
 once I did not queue to edit 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.380
 go see the team as who I'm going 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.700
 fall so already froze already I see face 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.440
 to an opponent who follow he made me 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.790
 a little scared at first because there 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.070
 had a way of playing enough 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.930
 particular as you can see 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.490
 finally you when you will see it very 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.560
 very defensive it's a lot of passes 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.170
 twenty two for not so much 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.390
 there a shirt is disgusting a 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.050
 refocusing not like at all so his 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.480
 team already at 84.2 note here is a big 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.090
 team iia look we have god 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.390
 levono ski from robben from cazorla boost 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.669
 on the side of the morning chamberlain oxlade 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.040
 and good luck so has a very good team 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.090
 offensive even though certainly not his 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.860
 collective to have it going very well 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.670
 started thirty second balls for 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.440
 anderson shift the fat 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.210
 it's even including surface the little 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.490
 pitched ball that scored 1 goal at 0 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.990
 it's perfect you'll see that this 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.220
 match is going to be looted pretty quickly 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.050
 look at half time it was 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.450
 balanced even if we dominate a little more 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.970
 on the side of the procession was to see that 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.310
 we will succeed in the 51st we will always 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.960
 wake up zerka the second period is going 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.510
 to be more prolific in any case 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.100
 we will have control of the ball 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.040
 51st sissoko ball to succeed 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.050
 landaise the pitched ball and that's the 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.270
 little goal of chicharito his very first 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.640
 first match planned it's perfect 51st 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.050
 but it's here the match will stop here 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.520
 simply because we observe at this 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.840
 kit thereafter so to redeem in 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.110
