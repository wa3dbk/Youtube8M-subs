00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi to all the boys and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 This new video of mine will talk to you today 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.910
 of pes and fifa therefore if you have written 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.860
 in your youtube search bar is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.179
 scontro fifa you clicked on the video 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.679
 that's right for you 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.820
 today we talk about the situation 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.710
 is coming to create between the two 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.080
 football then a real one 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 rebellion by the fans of FIFA 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.220
 because when it comes to simulators 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.590
 football players are real fans 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 then one comes to talk of a scared person 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 always the same and always if we don't say 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.020
 just the same but very similar to the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.420
 version 2015 in fact I think too 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.239
 so and a pass that is practically 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.879
 was almost completely renovated e 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.379
 even if to a 55 percent product 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.120
 60 percent 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.370
 really convinced me from you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 gameplay videos distributed on the net 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.410
 then from the comments I found on 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.280
 various forums and especially on facebook and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.850
 youtube is known as the supporters of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.700
 title are scared they are angry and want 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:12.180
 that you know processes practically put 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 new news on their game and not that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 stay as it is 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.990
 because in fact I noticed that it is a lot 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.630
 very similar to last year 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.930
 this year I opted for pif for pes 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.770
 15 sorry is because he had the courage 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.990
 to improve instead I don't know why 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.820
 how did it get worse instead of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.780
 improve 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.369
 this is something I say I don't have 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 understood in fact debut the fyf at 15 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.310
 best on old hygienic consoles on 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.689

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.890
 trend between

 the fifa 16 or fifa 15 has lost 16 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.960
