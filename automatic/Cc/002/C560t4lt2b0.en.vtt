00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.520 

alright<00:00:01.210> thought<00:00:01.629> for<00:00:01.839> a<00:00:01.899> change<00:00:02.169> of<00:00:02.320> pace<00:00:02.470> and

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:02.530 
alright thought for a change of pace and

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.920 
alright thought for a change of pace and
to<00:00:02.890> start<00:00:03.160> off<00:00:03.250> a<00:00:03.280> new<00:00:03.400> commentary<00:00:04.060> we'd<00:00:04.480> start

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:04.930 
to start off a new commentary we'd start

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.089 
to start off a new commentary we'd start
with<00:00:04.990> a<00:00:05.790> minecraft<00:00:06.790> video<00:00:07.089> for<00:00:07.360> once<00:00:07.569> so<00:00:08.559> here

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:09.099 
with a minecraft video for once so here

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.390 
with a minecraft video for once so here
I<00:00:09.219> have<00:00:09.339> a<00:00:09.639> fairly<00:00:10.030> simple<00:00:10.509> well<00:00:11.110> simple<00:00:11.650> is<00:00:12.309> it

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
I have a fairly simple well simple is it

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.539 
I have a fairly simple well simple is it
relative<00:00:13.179> term<00:00:13.389> mechanism<00:00:14.259> that<00:00:14.440> step<00:00:15.400> on

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
relative term mechanism that step on

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.260 
relative term mechanism that step on
this<00:00:15.699> I'll<00:00:16.059> deactivate<00:00:16.840> it<00:00:18.030> step<00:00:19.030> on<00:00:19.150> this

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
this I'll deactivate it step on this

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.440 
this I'll deactivate it step on this
pressure<00:00:19.540> plate<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:21.310> lights<00:00:21.520> opens<00:00:22.300> up

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
pressure plate some lights opens up

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.890 
pressure plate some lights opens up
piston<00:00:22.960> door<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.900> and<00:00:27.270> step<00:00:28.270> on<00:00:28.420> this<00:00:28.660> subject

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
piston door so and step on this subject

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.689 
piston door so and step on this subject
preferably<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:31.060> it<00:00:31.150> turns<00:00:31.330> off<00:00:31.539> so<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:33.640> we

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
preferably and it turns off so if we

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.599 
preferably and it turns off so if we
look<00:00:33.850> at<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.149> wiring<00:00:34.600> here<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:36.280> pressure

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
look at the wiring here this pressure

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.689 
look at the wiring here this pressure
plate<00:00:36.909> that<00:00:37.059> turns<00:00:37.269> everything<00:00:37.570> on<00:00:38.640> sends<00:00:39.640> a

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
plate that turns everything on sends a

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.819 
plate that turns everything on sends a
signal<00:00:39.879> here<00:00:40.359> which<00:00:40.659> travels<00:00:41.230> vertically

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
signal here which travels vertically

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.939 
signal here which travels vertically
using<00:00:42.010> this<00:00:42.730> alternating<00:00:43.800> current<00:00:44.800> with

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
using this alternating current with

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.369 
using this alternating current with
torches<00:00:45.359> and<00:00:46.359> it<00:00:46.479> sends<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:46.780> signal<00:00:47.170> into

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
torches and it sends the signal into

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.880 
torches and it sends the signal into
here<00:00:47.679> this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.839> fairly<00:00:50.170> watered<00:00:50.679> down

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
here this is a fairly watered down

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.079 
here this is a fairly watered down
memory<00:00:51.489> cell<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:54.309> this<00:00:54.429> does<00:00:54.489> is<00:00:54.879> this

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
memory cell and what this does is this

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.629 
memory cell and what this does is this
inverts<00:00:55.569> this<00:00:55.839> torch<00:00:56.139> which<00:00:56.679> has<00:00:56.889> currently

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:57.639 
inverts this torch which has currently

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.629 
inverts this torch which has currently
turned<00:00:57.969> on<00:00:58.149> and<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.620> will<00:00:59.799> turn<00:00:59.979> on<00:01:00.159> this<00:01:00.370> one

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
turned on and that will turn on this one

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.629 
turned on and that will turn on this one
which<00:01:01.089> sends<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.139> signal<00:01:02.350> down<00:01:02.739> here<00:01:02.949> which<00:01:03.429> has

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
which sends a signal down here which has

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.490 
which sends a signal down here which has
put<00:01:04.330> your<00:01:04.480> breads<00:01:04.660> done<00:01:04.840> sitting<00:01:05.080> on<00:01:05.290> top<00:01:05.470> of

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
put your breads done sitting on top of

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.430 
put your breads done sitting on top of
all<00:01:05.770> these<00:01:05.890> lamps<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.640> does<00:01:10.440> what

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
all these lamps and what this does what

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.770 
all these lamps and what this does what
this<00:01:11.680> setup<00:01:11.980> up<00:01:12.250> here<00:01:12.460> does<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.910> memory

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
this setup up here does this memory

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
this setup up here does this memory
latches<00:01:14.560> when<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.370> goes<00:01:16.030> off<00:01:16.270> we<00:01:17.230> do<00:01:17.650> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.070 

when<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.700> goes<00:01:21.850> off<00:01:22.060> when<00:01:22.450> this<00:01:22.600> torch<00:01:22.870> goes

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
when it goes off when this torch goes

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.720 
when it goes off when this torch goes
off<00:01:23.260> it<00:01:23.530> will<00:01:23.650> stay<00:01:23.950> off<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.700> very

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
off it will stay off and that's a very

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.870 
off it will stay off and that's a very
nice<00:01:28.060> way<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:29.130> memory<00:01:30.130> cells<00:01:30.340> are<00:01:30.520> very<00:01:30.700> nice

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
nice way and memory cells are very nice

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.490 
nice way and memory cells are very nice
way<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.120> you<00:01:31.890> using<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:33.130> one-time<00:01:33.940> input<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
way of you using a one-time input to

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.480 
way of you using a one-time input to
have<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> lasting<00:01:36.190> effect<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:37.470> notice<00:01:38.470> if<00:01:39.430> you

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
have a lasting effect and notice if you

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.020 
have a lasting effect and notice if you
keep<00:01:39.760> anything<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.270> will<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:41.500> anything<00:01:42.030> at

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
keep anything it will do anything at

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.700 
keep anything it will do anything at
least<00:01:43.090> in<00:01:43.420> this<00:01:43.510> version<00:01:43.780> hopefully<00:01:44.440> soon

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
least in this version hopefully soon

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.560 
least in this version hopefully soon
I'll<00:01:44.860> be<00:01:44.890> able<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.220> have<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.000> all<00:01:46.090> controlled

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
I'll be able to have it all controlled

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.920 
I'll be able to have it all controlled
by<00:01:46.750> one<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:50.490> sends<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.580> pulse<00:01:51.930> through

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
by one and this sends a pulse through

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.820 
by one and this sends a pulse through
here<00:01:53.170> travel<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.800> up<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.570> inverts<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.930> turns

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
here travel it up and inverts and turns

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.530 
here travel it up and inverts and turns
that<00:01:56.950> torch<00:01:57.310> off<00:01:57.490> which<00:01:57.730> turns<00:01:57.970> this<00:01:58.210> one<00:01:58.390> on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
that torch off which turns this one on

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.160 
that torch off which turns this one on
which<00:01:59.350> resets<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.070> lot<00:02:00.190> of<00:02:00.280> them<00:02:00.480> now<00:02:01.480> that

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
which resets a lot of them now that

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.340 
which resets a lot of them now that
covers<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.620> lamps<00:02:03.330> doors<00:02:04.330> however<00:02:04.930> are

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
covers the lamps doors however are

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.940 
covers the lamps doors however are
different<00:02:06.090> our<00:02:07.090> different<00:02:07.510> animal

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.340 

the<00:02:10.950> off<00:02:11.100> switch<00:02:11.310> sets<00:02:11.760> everything<00:02:12.210> back<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the off switch sets everything back so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.000 
the off switch sets everything back so
that<00:02:13.500> means<00:02:13.740> in<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.430> off<00:02:14.610> state<00:02:15.560> these<00:02:16.560> three

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
that means in the off state these three

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.650 
that means in the off state these three
pistons<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.700> grabbing<00:02:17.880> these<00:02:18.150> three<00:02:18.420> blocks

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
pistons are grabbing these three blocks

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.020 
pistons are grabbing these three blocks
and<00:02:19.050> if<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:21.500> got<00:02:22.500> three<00:02:22.740> more<00:02:22.770> Pistons<00:02:23.400> down

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and if we got three more Pistons down

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.699 
and if we got three more Pistons down
here<00:02:25.790> which<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:26.970> grabbing<00:02:27.240> these<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> that

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
here which are grabbing these so that

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.640 
here which are grabbing these so that
means<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.100> when<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.209> currents<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.720> they

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
means that when this currents on they

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.840 
means that when this currents on they
are<00:02:31.800> they're<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:33.740> stuck<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> iron<00:02:35.459> blocks

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
are they're all stuck to the iron blocks

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.699 
are they're all stuck to the iron blocks
so<00:02:36.150> when<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.420> when<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.840> current<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.200> activated

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
so when it when the current is activated

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.740 
so when it when the current is activated
they'll<00:02:38.280> retract<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.150> they<00:02:39.450> stay<00:02:39.630> are

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
they'll retract and they stay are

travels over and sends one to here and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.400 
travels over and sends one to here and
these<00:03:24.480> two<00:03:24.690> blocks<00:03:24.959> are<00:03:25.200> here<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:26.360> prevent

these two blocks are here to prevent

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.320 
these two blocks are here to prevent
well<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:31.580> they're<00:03:32.580> there<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.030> this

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
well this they're there so that this

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.580 
well this they're there so that this
doesn't<00:03:33.540> happen<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.290> don't<00:03:34.500> have

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
doesn't happen and you don't have

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.850 
doesn't happen and you don't have
partially<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.630> when<00:03:36.630> everything<00:03:37.500> supposed<00:03:37.769> to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
partially on when everything supposed to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.920 
partially on when everything supposed to
be<00:03:37.950> off<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:41.670> about<00:03:41.970> sums<00:03:42.540> up<00:03:42.720> this

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
be off and that about sums up this

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.069 
be off and that about sums up this
design<00:03:43.350> it's<00:03:43.650> fairly<00:03:44.959> personally<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:45.989> think

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
design it's fairly personally I think

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.080 
design it's fairly personally I think
would<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.590> very<00:03:46.739> fitting<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:48.049> anyhow<00:03:49.970> sort<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
would be very fitting for anyhow sort of

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.259 
would be very fitting for anyhow sort of
walk<00:03:51.360> on

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
walk on

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.610 
walk on
possibly<00:03:54.269> an<00:03:54.330> adventure<00:03:54.720> Rapinoe<00:03:55.110> this

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
possibly an adventure Rapinoe this

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.130 
possibly an adventure Rapinoe this
sponge<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.400> here<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.760> signify<00:03:57.540> our<00:03:57.750> walls

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
sponge is just here to signify our walls

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.670 
sponge is just here to signify our walls
could<00:03:59.010> be<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.819> hallway

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
could be if this is the hallway

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.770 
could be if this is the hallway
obviously<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.799> can<00:04:02.010> fill<00:04:02.970> things<00:04:03.239> in<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:03.629> that

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
obviously you can fill things in so that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.240 
obviously you can fill things in so that
the<00:04:03.959> iron<00:04:04.319> blocks<00:04:04.620> are<00:04:04.799> flush<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.069> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
the iron blocks are flush with the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.089 
the iron blocks are flush with the
ceiling<00:04:05.819> or<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:07.049> covers<00:04:07.440> up<00:04:07.590> all<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.860> wiring

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
ceiling or this covers up all the wiring

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.020 
ceiling or this covers up all the wiring
but<00:04:09.049> in<00:04:10.049> general<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.799> doesn't<00:04:11.489> really<00:04:11.610> take<00:04:11.879> up

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
but in general it doesn't really take up

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.910 
but in general it doesn't really take up
that<00:04:12.060> much<00:04:12.209> space<00:04:12.360> which<00:04:12.930> was<00:04:13.140> when<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.829> started

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
that much space which was when I started

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920 
that much space which was when I started
off<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.549> was<00:04:14.610> sticking<00:04:15.360> all<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.690> way<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:15.900> to

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
off I was sticking all the way up to

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.460 
off I was sticking all the way up to
here<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.410> had<00:04:16.620> long<00:04:16.859> wires<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.639> suction<00:04:18.470> it's

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
here I had long wires and suction it's

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.340 
here I had long wires and suction it's
just<00:04:19.769> spent<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.130> bit<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.340> time<00:04:21.199> optimising<00:04:22.199> and

just spent a bit of time optimising and

just spent a bit of time optimising and
