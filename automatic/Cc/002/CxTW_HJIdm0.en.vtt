 most value is the sense of humor all 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.350
 the world knows the sense of humor and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 he was very tense 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.770
 something relaxed 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.690

 is squeezing it right now 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.670

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.620
 in the filming of the announcement saying let's 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.770

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.480

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.790

 of the street parking for each channel 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.620
 and they moved me to the next phase of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.620
 tomb 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.709

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.420
 I had no fucking idea what it was but I said 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.680
 I'll wait until the day because I'm 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.709

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.230
 I 'll find out I did well because I was 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.909

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.430
 I picked up the co-director 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.190
 this structure 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.250

 executive vice president asked me the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.820
