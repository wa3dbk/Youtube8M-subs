00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
do once you've actually finished running

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.560 
do once you've actually finished running
your<00:00:11.210> RC<00:00:11.660> vehicle<00:00:12.820> when<00:00:13.820> you<00:00:14.000> have<00:00:14.240> finished

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
your RC vehicle when you have finished

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.100 
your RC vehicle when you have finished

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
running your RC car your trap you should

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.919 
running your RC car your trap you should
always<00:00:18.320> perform<00:00:18.950> some<00:00:19.400> very<00:00:19.610> important<00:00:20.270> after

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:20.929 
always perform some very important after

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.249 
always perform some very important after
run<00:00:21.109> maintenance<00:00:21.830> steps<00:00:22.220> in<00:00:22.970> order<00:00:23.269> to<00:00:23.689> extend

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
run maintenance steps in order to extend

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.790 
run maintenance steps in order to extend
and<00:00:24.769> maximize<00:00:25.550> your<00:00:25.939> nitro<00:00:26.630> powered<00:00:26.929> engines

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
and maximize your nitro powered engines

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.109 
and maximize your nitro powered engines
life<00:00:29.529> first<00:00:30.529> thing<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:30.949> recommend<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.669> do<00:00:31.820> is

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
life first thing I recommend to do is

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.250 
life first thing I recommend to do is
actually<00:00:32.450> just<00:00:33.350> try<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.160> start<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.720> engine

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
actually just try and start the engine

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.430 
actually just try and start the engine
to<00:00:36.590> remove<00:00:36.950> any<00:00:37.190> leftover<00:00:38.149> fuel<00:00:38.450> left<00:00:39.200> in

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
to remove any leftover fuel left in

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.670 
to remove any leftover fuel left in
there<00:00:39.920> doing<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:41.030> would<00:00:41.390> mean<00:00:41.660> that<00:00:42.079> there

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
there doing this would mean that there

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.000 
there doing this would mean that there
won't<00:00:42.739> be<00:00:43.129> any<00:00:43.600> nitro<00:00:44.600> fuel<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.320> engine<00:00:45.800> to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
won't be any nitro fuel in the engine to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.950 
won't be any nitro fuel in the engine to
attract<00:00:46.550> or<00:00:47.980> get<00:00:48.980> any<00:00:49.390> moisture<00:00:50.390> inside<00:00:50.660> the

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
attract or get any moisture inside the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.450 
attract or get any moisture inside the
ng<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.190> let's<00:00:52.640> insert<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.449> igniter<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.460> pull

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
ng so let's insert the igniter and pull

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.020 
ng so let's insert the igniter and pull
the<00:00:55.609> pool<00:00:55.789> start<00:00:56.149> until<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:57.500> might<00:00:57.890> start<00:00:58.309> so

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
the pool start until it might start so

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.160 
the pool start until it might start so
let's<00:00:59.390> do<00:00:59.660> that<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:02.210> pull<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.719> pulse<00:01:02.960> and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
let's do that and and pull the pulse and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.880 
let's do that and and pull the pulse and
arts<00:01:03.530> until<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.760> might<00:01:05.150> start<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.290> let's<00:01:06.650> do

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
arts until it might start so let's do

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.550 
arts until it might start so let's do
that<00:01:09.130> okay<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.340> no<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.850> engine<00:01:11.299> doesn't<00:01:12.170> want

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
that okay so no the engine doesn't want

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.469 
that okay so no the engine doesn't want
to<00:01:12.710> start<00:01:13.009> which<00:01:13.340> means<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.759> there<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.240> no

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
to start which means that there is no

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.350 
to start which means that there is no
fuel<00:01:14.840> left<00:01:15.049> in<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.439> engine<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.100> ignite<00:01:16.549> so

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
fuel left in the engine to ignite so

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.690 
fuel left in the engine to ignite so
once<00:01:17.810> we've<00:01:18.020> done<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.259> I'd<00:01:19.040> recommend

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
once we've done that I'd recommend

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.740 
once we've done that I'd recommend
removing<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.530> glow<00:01:21.740> plug<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.000> remove<00:01:23.630> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
removing the glow plug so remove the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.969 
removing the glow plug so remove the
globe<00:01:23.930> black<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.369> globe<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:29.409> few<00:01:30.409> drops<00:01:30.680> of

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
globe black so the globe a few drops of

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:41.350 
globe black so the globe a few drops of
after<00:01:31.610> run<00:01:33.220> inside<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:35.360> engine

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.580 

next<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.900> off<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> air<00:01:43.560> filter<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:45.590> put

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
next take off the air filter and put

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.040 
next take off the air filter and put
another<00:01:47.400> two<00:01:48.120> drops<00:01:48.800> inside<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.400> air<00:01:50.610> filter

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.630 

next<00:01:55.050> what<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.440> do<00:01:55.620> is<00:01:55.860> actually<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.610> over

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
next what you can do is actually go over

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
next what you can do is actually go over
the<00:01:57.210> car<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:59.130> clean<00:01:59.670> or<00:02:00.060> wipe<00:02:00.420> down<00:02:01.160> this

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
the car and just clean or wipe down this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.609 
the car and just clean or wipe down this
dirt

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.450 

once<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.460> have<00:02:11.700> actually<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.950> wiped<00:02:14.220> down

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
once you have actually just wiped down

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.450 
once you have actually just wiped down
the<00:02:14.520> car<00:02:14.910> go<00:02:15.840> over<00:02:15.870> its<00:02:16.380> checking<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.280> any

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
filter back on to the RC car next what I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.670 
filter back on to the RC car next what I
would<00:02:59.160> recommend<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.790> do<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.540> simply<00:03:00.989> check

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
would recommend to do is to simply check

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.479 
would recommend to do is to simply check
all<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.180> parts<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.290> vehicle<00:03:04.560> are<00:03:04.950> working

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
all the parts on the vehicle are working
