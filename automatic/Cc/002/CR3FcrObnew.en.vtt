00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
many different kinds of projects a lot
of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> projects<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.479> you've

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of the projects that you know you've

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.830 
of the projects that you know you've
mentioned<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.130> where<00:01:14.700> exactly<00:01:14.970> does<00:01:15.330> content

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
mentioned so where exactly does content

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.760

critical<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.909> probably<00:01:21.420> something

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
critical and it's probably something

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
designers may not be thinking about

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960

the alpha stage or the beta stage as
you're<00:01:48.299> building<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.659> new<00:01:48.780> site<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> new<00:01:49.470> app

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you're building a new site or a new app

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.010 
you're building a new site or a new app
it<00:01:49.979> may<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.549> creating<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.540> interesting

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it may be creating an interesting

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.530 
it may be creating an interesting
overview<00:01:52.560> video<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.130> shares<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.329> it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
overview video that shares it it's it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
overview video that shares it it's it's
one<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> those<00:01:54.869> steps<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.710> think<00:01:55.890> it's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
one of those steps that I think it's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.980 
one of those steps that I think it's
forgotten<00:01:56.909> about<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.299> yet<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.630> really

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
forgotten about and yet it's really

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.959 
forgotten about and yet it's really
really<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.530> critical<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.310> let's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
really really critical because let's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
really really critical because let's
