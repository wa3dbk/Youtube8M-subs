that<00:00:17.279> Hyundai<00:00:18.000> makes<00:00:18.210> two<00:00:18.510> different<00:00:18.720> engines

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
that Hyundai makes two different engines

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.460 
that Hyundai makes two different engines
and<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.910> way<00:00:21.000> they<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.180> their<00:00:21.390> filter<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and the way they do their filter is I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.810 
and the way they do their filter is I
love<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.949> filter<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> way<00:00:23.550> they<00:00:23.670> have

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
love the filter but the way they have

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.050 
love the filter but the way they have
their<00:00:24.529> MAF<00:00:25.529> sensor<00:00:25.699> mass<00:00:26.699> airflow<00:00:26.939> sensor

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
their MAF sensor mass airflow sensor

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.589 
their MAF sensor mass airflow sensor
would<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.990> attached<00:00:28.429> generally<00:00:29.429> right<00:00:30.210> here

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
would be attached generally right here

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.729 
would be attached generally right here
that's<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.619> O<00:00:31.710> 607<00:00:32.669> oh<00:00:33.230> nine<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.680> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that's for an O 607 oh nine and I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
that's for an O 607 oh nine and I
believe<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> O<00:00:35.309> 10<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.700> well<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.600> no

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
believe the O 10 as well but I have no

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.229 
believe the O 10 as well but I have no
weight<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.530> over<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.790> don't<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
weight so it's over here I don't have to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.220 
weight so it's over here I don't have to
worry<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:39.960> I've<00:00:40.050> basically

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
worry about that what I've basically

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.790 
worry about that what I've basically
done<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.680> I've<00:00:40.829> taken<00:00:41.070> off<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.850> filter<00:00:42.300> box

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
done is I've taken off the filter box

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
done is I've taken off the filter box
which<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.530> connects

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
which as you can see right here connects

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
which as you can see right here connects
right<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> hose<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
right here and then the hose for the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
right here and then the hose for the
forced<00:00:49.260> comes<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> bottom<00:00:50.340> over<00:00:50.579> there

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
forced comes from the bottom over there

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
forced comes from the bottom over there
then<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.360> filter<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> inside

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
then you have your filter on the inside

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
then you have your filter on the inside
what<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> basically<00:00:53.039> did<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:54.030> went<00:00:54.449> online<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
what I basically did was went online and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.490 
what I basically did was went online and
bought<00:00:55.140> myself<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.399> filter<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.940> went<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
bought myself a filter I went out to the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
bought myself a filter I went out to the
local<00:00:58.739> hardware<00:00:58.920> store<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> bought<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
local hardware store and bought a I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.399 
local hardware store and bought a I
guess<00:01:01.020> you'd<00:01:01.140> say<00:01:01.230> ah<00:01:02.480> some<00:01:03.480> piping<00:01:03.809> three

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
guess you'd say ah some piping three

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.969 
guess you'd say ah some piping three
inch<00:01:04.530> piping<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> two<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.090> three<00:01:06.979> 3/4

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
inch piping for the two and three 3/4

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.969 
inch piping for the two and three 3/4
piping<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.760> our<00:01:08.970> stock<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> car<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> I

which I have no freaking clue what the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.520 
which I have no freaking clue what the
hell<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.290> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
hell that is

hell that is
anyways<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.610> want<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> make<00:01:33.000> your

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
anyways and then you want to make your

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.580 
anyways and then you want to make your
own<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.540> brackets<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
own kind of brackets or something to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
own kind of brackets or something to
hold<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.130> place<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hold this in place it's one of the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
hold this in place it's one of the
sensors<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.439> electronics<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.189> attached

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
sensors or electronics that's attached

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.499 
sensors or electronics that's attached
to<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:39.439> air<00:01:40.439> cleaning<00:01:40.799> box<00:01:41.360> you're<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
to your air cleaning box you're going to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
to your air cleaning box you're going to
want<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.689> attach<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.110> back<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.610> basically

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
want to attach that back down basically

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.539 
want to attach that back down basically
I've<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.149> set<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.680> it'll<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
I've just set this up so that it'll just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.639 
I've just set this up so that it'll just
suck<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.119> much<00:01:48.180> air<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.479> possible<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
suck in as much air as possible and I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.109 
suck in as much air as possible and I
didn't<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.040> remove<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> whole<00:01:50.670> assembly

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
didn't really remove the whole assembly

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.999 
didn't really remove the whole assembly
if<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.540> inside<00:01:51.810> there<00:01:52.200> there's

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
if you can see inside there there's

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.810 
if you can see inside there there's
