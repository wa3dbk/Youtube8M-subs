00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.050 
step-by-step tactics because I think
it's<00:02:02.439> important<00:02:02.979> again<00:02:03.579> for<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:03.969> to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
it's important again for you to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.080 
it's important again for you to
understand<00:02:04.479> how<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.840> works<00:02:05.819> you<00:02:06.819> know<00:02:06.939> in

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
understand how this works you know in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.760 
understand how this works you know in
order<00:02:07.240> for<00:02:07.539> you<00:02:07.689> going<00:02:08.080> forward<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.619> able

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
order for you going forward to be able

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.169 
order for you going forward to be able
to<00:02:08.860> do<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.099> for<00:02:09.340> yourself<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:09.970> we're<00:02:10.090> going

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
to do this for yourself so we're going

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.400 
to do this for yourself so we're going
to<00:02:10.270> talk<00:02:10.450> about<00:02:10.599> theory<00:02:11.080> you're<00:02:11.230> going<00:02:11.349> to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
to talk about theory you're going to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.960 
to talk about theory you're going to
really<00:02:11.680> kind<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.040> get<00:02:12.190> grounded<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
really kind of get grounded and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.760 
really kind of get grounded and
understand<00:02:13.390> exactly<00:02:13.569> how<00:02:14.020> this<00:02:14.260> works<00:02:14.530> and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
understand exactly how this works and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.470 
understand exactly how this works and
then<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> tactics<00:02:15.819> are<00:02:15.970> really<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.330> going

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
then the tactics are really just going

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.630 
then the tactics are really just going
to<00:02:16.540> fall<00:02:16.720> into<00:02:16.900> place<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.349> basically<00:02:17.890> instead

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
to fall into place so basically instead

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.949 
to fall into place so basically instead
of<00:02:18.790> giving<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.390> fish<00:02:19.629> we're<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
of giving you a fish we're going to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.170 
of giving you a fish we're going to
teach<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.409> how<00:02:20.439> to<00:02:20.709> fish

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
teach you how to fish

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.339 
teach you how to fish
today<00:02:21.359> okay<00:02:21.659> we're<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.959> teach<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.319> how

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
today okay we're going to teach you how

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.410 
today okay we're going to teach you how
this<00:02:22.590> works<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.519> once<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.909> understand

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
this works so that once you understand

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.899 
this works so that once you understand
this<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.870> really<00:02:25.079> build<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.909> you

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
this you can really build on it and you

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.599 
this you can really build on it and you
know<00:02:27.000> go<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.209> there<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.689> your<00:02:27.900> own<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.609> and

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
know go out there on your own and and

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.190 
know go out there on your own and and
really<00:02:29.730> accomplish<00:02:30.299> some<00:02:30.480> great<00:02:30.659> things<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
really accomplish some great things and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.229 
really accomplish some great things and
the<00:02:31.890> final<00:02:32.519> thing<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.700> we're<00:02:32.879> going<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.060> do

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
over and over and over again to do these

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.520 
over and over and over again to do these
searches<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.880> when<00:04:49.570> they<00:04:49.720> do<00:04:49.780> they<00:04:50.110> expose

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
them to ads so the very first thing

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.540

obviously<00:04:52.840> that<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.350> search<00:04:53.620> engine<00:04:53.770> has<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.370> do

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
obviously that a search engine has to do

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.360 
obviously that a search engine has to do
is<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:55.450> has<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.960> get<00:04:56.380> rid<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.710> spam<00:04:56.950> has<00:04:57.220> to

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
is it has to get rid of the spam has to

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.360 
is it has to get rid of the spam has to
find<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:58.060> good<00:04:58.500> content<00:04:59.500> out<00:04:59.740> there<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:02.370> the

find the good content out there and the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.030 
find the good content out there and the
reason<00:05:03.730> why<00:05:03.820> this<00:05:03.910> is<00:05:04.210> hard<00:05:04.390> again<00:05:05.040> because

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
reason why this is hard again because

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.890 
reason why this is hard again because
most<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.580> Internet<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.060> just<00:05:07.330> complete

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
another utter trash what Google needs to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.370 
another utter trash what Google needs to
do<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:11.980> find<00:05:12.310> again<00:05:12.760> those<00:05:13.120> good<00:05:13.540> websites

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380
