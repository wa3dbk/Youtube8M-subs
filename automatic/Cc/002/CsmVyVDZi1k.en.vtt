00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello that such friends welcome to the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.889
 minimal in the kitchen today are going to 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.230
 be a super-rich vegetarian pozole and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.289
 for this I already have water here that I'm going to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.840
 put to boil and I'm going to add a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:25.560
 handful of oregano some laurel leaves 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.730
 half onion but also a spoonful 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.730
 of cumin half a teaspoon of pepper 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.160
 three little children 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.260
 and here I have the step 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.550
 formed and the water comes out transparent 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.809
 then I will empty it 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.809
 on my sheet 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.140
 and let's wait for it to be done well 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.090
 until it opens it is very soft 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.010
 for the chile we are going to need 6 chilies 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 guajillo chile colorado this mirasol the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.250
 that you get and two chilies 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.310
 pasillas a wide chili and 2 tomatitos 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.410
 we're going to start boiling and once 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.090
 boil off and let stand for 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.429
 to soften 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 here I have a lettuce orejona is the 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.710
 I'm going to chop fine and we're going to wash it 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.819
 and disinfect this is going to be for 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.819
 accompany our process 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.170
 to accompany I also have half 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.570
 onion that I will cut it finally and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.390
 10 rabanitos this that's a little 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.390
 bigger this is for very little 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.259
 people and you are going to have more 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.409
 guests or will it be for more people 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.409
 they can apply more quantity 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.909
 to liquefy the chili I'm just going to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000
 use a piece of onion and a garlic 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.560
 because I think the seasoning is already 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.570
 well with what you throw into the pot but 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.880
 Once you empty it, throw in the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.970
 flavors if it lacked something then then 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.610
 we already added it, I already have lists 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.619
 chilies to liquefy this ones to drain 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.509
 well and add clean water so that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.509
 we are not going to embitter the salsita 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.260
 I have a big box of mushrooms 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.209
 scremini I'm going to cut them into pieces 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.209
 not very big and not very small 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.920
 since it's in the post solitos so well 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.810
 open I like them to be well 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.560
 open and softly then I'm going to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.599
 empty all the mushrooms have already passed 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.819
 I poured three minutes mushrooms 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.079
 and it's time to pass the salt 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.790
 some accounts is what we are going to put 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.500
 and then we are going to empty the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.170
 Chile 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 putting a colander we go to the cinema and 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.010
 we see if we need everything just a little 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.050
 just to paint it here l base in chile 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.810
 it was only half of the preparation that 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.440
 I already had and we're going to let it boil 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.950
 15 minutes 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.330
 we try and if something is missing 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.870
 we rectify flavor and if not then 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.030
 it will be ready 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.909
 and this is how our rich pozole is already 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.459
 we accompany it with radish lettuce 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.489
 onion and lemon and some be see if 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.250
