00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Talk to me, everyone. I 'm Alexandre. 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.379
 callari here right from the pocket blog here 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.349
 or in the dead of night having tea 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.349
 of red tasty fruit refreshing 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.240
 producing this strong away for you 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.010
 To talk about it here, the story. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 secret of the marvel way because it is is that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 accompanying our channel saw that I 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.300
 I bought this book to get this book. 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.289
 there at the fest comix and until then had not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.190
 read the book 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.300
 I did not devour the 500 more than 500 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.170
 pages you have here and I should say that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 It is a unique experience to consume this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.239
 The Marvel Comics secret story is 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.239
 simply stunning 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.579
 it is some warnings in the first place 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 person that she is more a person than she 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.210
 already begun in the history of marvel 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.420
 Reading makes a lot of difference. 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.270
 for example every time a 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.010
 artist a screenwriter the author does it 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 a small triangle explaining that this 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.970
 face that appears the name of a cinema he 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.670
 Talking about a movie did that, that. 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 that's why it's important 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 he imagines that the layman can not 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.180
 measure the importance that had a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.880
 ema of the personal brand in the history of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.950
 comics as a whole but when the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.040
 started listening to the name of both and me 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.150
 told the game sema and this has a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.710
 other weight 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.869
 as well as all names that go 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.829
 appear in the book then it is a 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.320
 previous knowledge a knowledge is 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.000
 wo have a knowledge of the history of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.220
 comic book history makes 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 difference and makes reading even more 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.600
 delicious 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.979
 obviously not essential right? 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.950
 You can enjoy this book in a good way without 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:04.350
 know absolutely nothing good 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:07.310
 delicious delicious reading begins 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.820
 there in the 30's with martin goodman 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.740
 founding the team it right and obviously the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.090
 history of the brand accompanies the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.650
 own history of comics that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.050
 born born the team 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.350
 then it will come after the 50's after 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.510
 turns marvel comics 60's and is not 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.430
 exclusively the history of the marvel 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.950
 be told other things will appear 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.740
 the process is beautiful 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.350
 pretty pretty pretty 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.980
 stories behind the scenes the author 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.480
 As far as possible it puts the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.600
 several sides of the coin 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.180
 then the fight is Christian and steve ditko 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.980
 because of the spider man he puts 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.840
 testimony of a testimony of another of 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.000
 eight statements from people involved 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.110
 people who were there who saw what 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.450
 happened and most of the situations 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.650
 It's up to the reader to get it right there. 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.720
 what do you think 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.150
 I needed your conclusion after all 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.880
 this happened 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.120
 It is same with the field of history and 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.470
 after it comes out of marvel and dc 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.550
 his discussions with booth 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.550
 later, finally, people will tell 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.980
 step by step all editors who 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.890
 had everybody done shit everybody 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.080
 who hit the hand is because that kind 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.390
 almost degringolou the booth left by 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.220
 example was to work doing other 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.840
 things roy thomas took over with 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.330
 thomas took over the marvel almost 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.870
 degringolou because almost painless 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.330
 is the famous schutter legend of all 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.260
 errors and all hits it the same 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.860
 thing is organized some 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.970
 odin club figures is that a figure 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.670
 very important in the modern history of 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.320
 marvel had no concept and fucking face 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.890
 I'll break it down until one day 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.770
 heavy is a moment I thought 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.560
 that maybe obviously the first generation 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.070
 of the kambambe marvel is stan lee and steve 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.170
 ditko de nicolas galland was fucking in a 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.000
 a lot of history to be told right 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.890
 here comes the second generation by chris 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.700
 claremont from a neighborhood and frank miller 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.320
 It's that 80's fused guys too 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.930
 I knew the story was good when I still 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.380
 third generation that everybody can Me 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.300
 talk about lime and whistle this one is 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.520
 valentino I thought it would be a 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.980
 book bag was people will be a read bag 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.970
 About these guys, what's this? 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.760
 the foundation of the immediate is one of the 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.400
 Moments more fuck the book the hobbit 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.530
 today 's team, the team that speaks is 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.110
 independent of anything you 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.840
 think of them artistically as to how 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.460
 they designed the whole creation of the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.440
 image of how they wanted to screw 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.540
 even the marvel for everything that marvel 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.470
 I was doing with the authors 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.620
 My, you have to go to understand everything. 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.020
 history gives a new dimension people are 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.330
 talking about the issue I saw a lot 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.620
 people on the internet crucifying the 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.190
 a translator 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.050
 the epic of assis because of a term 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.800
 wrong translated that he translated 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.210
 deserve, what is the brazil lookout like 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.669
 observer 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.260
 note did not forgive optic that the watchman 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.600
 thesis as an observer 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.270
 at a moment the book in the front between 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.430
 the 7 as a lookout and the crucified galley 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.180
 How can the ego do it over there? 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.330
 Blah blah, my opinion as a translator. 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.340
 we also never know under which 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.220
 conditions were made books was made 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.850
 with deadlines was done without term does not give 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.490
 To know this, you're not talking about 550 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.590
 pages of material produced is not 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.630
 can crucify a guy because of a 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.300
 wrong word 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.400
 There are some problems the book has. 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.530
 any book will have yet another 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.110
 book of the sonority size of the 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.330
 Fuck stop will have problem but not 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.880
 will have a way but in general the 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.169
 everyone is very good very good you can not 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.060
 crucify the office because of it 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.210
 I do not agree on who does it. 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.090
 in general, having a saint of 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.710
 Congratulations and the edition is also 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.100
 Congratulations because it comes with a lot of 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.039

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.479

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.789

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:33.050
