00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.340
 hi guys today we are here in rome with 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.719
 the fast food crew that will teach you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:21.900
 meters of freestyle football 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:22.980
 follow us guys today trick 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.740
 is the nexus 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:34.020
 I'll show you to learn it not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.880
 launch it immediately and find it close 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.120
 three that the important thing is to understand the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.930
 initial position chest in out shoulders 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 a little inward 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.640
 go down and always look forward to me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.289
 I recommend if you look for the earth 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.020
 ball slips or from one side to the other 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.300
 so look ahead saying that you are 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 tried to rest the ball every 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.329
 back and different conformation 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.969
 so for everyone 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.219
 the trick will be absolutely personal 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 It was that I for example do a little 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.150
 the more this movement one holds 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.680
 arms wide in short, every scene 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 different however others did yes 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 wait outside in the second part 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.530
 you have to throw the ball I recommend 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.060
 throws three or more this height 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.729
 don't throw it too high otherwise 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.759
 it becomes very difficult to just throw it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.979
 over your head the chest out 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.110
 landslides inside and this time you will have to 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.110
 also amortize a little by connecting 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.619
 ok once you've launched it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.659
 you took it behind you have to give the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.229
 whiplash to get her back in 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.689
 forward, fold a little and let it go down 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.520
 and then the blow with the head again e 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.860
 timing is very important because if 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.110
 the ball goes too far from 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.539
 you will throw the front to you then the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.209
 You lose if you get up too close to 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:08.289
 launch behind you have to wait for the 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:11.110
 perfect timing then save the ball in 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.810
 hand three closed this rare fast food 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.590
