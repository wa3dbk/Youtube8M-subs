used these breaching techniques for
about<00:01:00.989> eight<00:01:01.289> years<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.829> our<00:01:02.309> department

about eight years in our department
we've<00:01:03.660> only<00:01:03.870> done<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:04.080> 12<00:01:04.589> operational

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
we've only done about 12 operational

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 
we've only done about 12 operational
breaches<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> importance<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
breaches but to the importance of this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
breaches but to the importance of this
training<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.920> gather<00:01:08.280> data<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.909> when

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
the great thing about it is although it

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.400 
the great thing about it is although it
