 and neither chicken Brazil beelinha that he is 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.390
 That for you, once more, ours is 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.090
 our autonomy in which we had here a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.090
 message from the junior valley is 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.940
 to calculate his diet does not go very well 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.770
 the pf but he sent his data here 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.960
 if you have this kind of doubt or 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.029
 something like that he said 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 that would send operator team in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 His gym is very easy then. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.619
 discuss with your nutritionist is a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.929
 person who will do your 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.820
 the diet is because there goes a lot of 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.500
 food it can pass from that food 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 and everything else for you but if you want 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.899
 do it alone on the blog here from Brazil and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 from Kenya when I had to go in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.440
 in the blog 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.320
 on the first page that appears on the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.950
 left but when calculators 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.110
 it's just you put there left aquino and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.289
 download here and find a calculator that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.750
 that you like a calculator that is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.219
 easy you calculate I'll calculate here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.980
 with my old calculator of mine 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.979
 first calculator than the spreadsheet 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 Calculus brazuca is open here and I 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.630
 I put it here so it was my 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.610
 first with the healer I set up 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.979
 here for the wtn channel web tv works 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 excellent and do not need anything else 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.470
 that and even some videos that people 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 placed here you can take your 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.439
 Your faith ball that means you 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.869
 you can even browse the videos you 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.020
 do not know how to consult the video here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.970
 people use with my daughter at this time 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.610
 where you can measure and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.829
 put it on the worksheet and take your 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.780
 Manifest then he does not know enough 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.520
 and I will use with the care that he 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.340
 put it simply for me to have a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.780
 idea how easy it is for you to do so weight 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.759
 of injury has 113 program 14.80 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.700
 amount of fat does not know then to 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.610
 and file height 59 put a meter and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.829
 eighty their age I'm 27 years old 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.479
 no longer have any information since 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.180
 so it's the only information I have 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 and this 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.200
 based on this we know very well why 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.930
 this calculator that people 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.540
 long time ago that he will not use the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.640
 qat form that is most recommended 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.500
 when you put the amount of 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 fat he uses this form that is in 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.459
 green and if you're a man 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.080
 you will use here resulting to 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.910
 man if you are woman 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.810
 you will then use for the woman who 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 it's in time it's in pink the people 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.780
 this video 11 informs about the same 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.250
 way to put it and everything else is like 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.080
 put the status in your first video 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.069
 I did but I'll do it here. 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.739
 quickly 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.470
 so here I am going to put the amount 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.760
 I want my diet if I'm going 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.130
 keep weight 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.280
 You teach me on this basis if I am 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.430
 the man once again well and this is a 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.319
 way and this is another way then you 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.349
 have to know that this is a form is a 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.329
 way of calculating and this is the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.900
 another way of calculating that you have 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.640
 doubt know not studied have not 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.640
 What I'm talking about, you can use 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.709
 references and look at the formulas uses the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.560
 Lovely lion to see if that's the way it is 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.480
 Figures you can use different things 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.120
 there to do the calculations 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.889
 but it's the easy basic is this here then 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.319
 I'll put it here in percentage then 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.139
 not say nothing is not fulfilled I 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.170
 I want to lose 20% 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.639
 I do not need to put 20% less 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.489
 highlighted in yellow 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.590
 I do not need to put less than 20 here is for 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.540
 weight loss is written in simon 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.670
 weight loss 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.400
 so you do not need to put less 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.060
 put only 20 and he will already make the bill 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.190
 if I put less than 20 will have more 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.769
 no then this idea because I 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.160
 I put this big good here to 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.160
 that you know that to place only 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.459
 20 so I want to lose 20% of what the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.709
 field there - 20% because that is here 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.810
 put in this self because I do not have the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.530
 how much this form of poll 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.349
 You're very well she uses with your 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.419
 amount of show bar and fat in this 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.190
 amount of fat so if you do not 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.380
 put it up here 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.479
 in this field the amount of fat 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.290
 so it will not work if you used 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.230
 this modus in old right 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.260
 I put here male without 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.270
 I'm going to make the calculation because it's 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.860
 here masculinist who can not change until 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.810
 Are you going to try to change, are you? 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.340
 applying that I could not change because 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.880
 I have to put the other measures 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.600
 so I'll here click the hip on the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.300
 video 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.050
 I go there with tape measure this measure of 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.020
 hip 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.360
 I 'll go back there and put the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.580
 amount you put on the tape measure and I 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.310
 there and make the waist of the neck soon 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.890
 here then then yes I can change 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.860
 This is okay here so you can try 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.660
 to do more like I do not know, so do not 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.330
 I will use this form this way will not 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.460
 active being unavailable 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.340
 so it 's here I can use this force 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.420
 and dental the amount of calories 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.490
 that has to direct the day is 2,250 if I 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.440
 for a person not to say a little active 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.030
 I do a little exercise in the 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:24.390
 gym etc and such can I eat 2438 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:28.110
 day 5 on depends on you did your 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.910
 began to do with a 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.610
 Let's see how that amount of 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.440
 family calorie that I can use 2626 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.990
 so if it's one in itself it 's a lot that I 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.540
 I'm watching the cloak I'm keeping mine. 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.030
 Pedro I can lower it a little 50 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.200
 more calories so more calories 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.980
 I can move to the level that the 1.3 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.190
 that would be 2,068 so let's say that 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.020
 I 'll just use this 2438 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.450
 joaquim diet I put it here 2,438 this 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.970
 it is already on the tab is written diet and now 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.550
 choose the amount that what I want 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.580
 I will say I want to eat 30% of 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:16.350
 protein I wanted with me 20 percent 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:19.560
 and non - fat 6% carbohydrate and 50 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.690
 let's put the tone here then understand 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.060
 He's going to give me calories here. 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.770
 grams how much do I have to eat 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.150
 now here for him the amount of 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.550
 meal I want to say I 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.669
 want to make only four meals already 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.230
 calculate for me total calories per 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.849
 meal how much I'll eat you 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.669
 quantities 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.119
 was continuous with carbohydrates and fat 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.979
 so it's really easy for you to do with 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:46.949
 even for a Brazilian calculation and now 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.629
 can I list my food here 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.159
 I'm going to eat at the time I'm going to eat. 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.629
 and digital edition 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:55.199
 So this is a way you can 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:57.360
 do but there is another our other 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.779
 Talent calculator you are much more 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.270

 same sites here you can go there and 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:21.179
