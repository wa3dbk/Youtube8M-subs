00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.759
BREF
that's me and that's me in front of my PC

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.069
When I was not playing world of warcraft is
that I sleep or that I am the toilet

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.370
- "I am the toilet there"

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.259
One day a friend told me, you should try world of warcraft
I told him that I was not too "games with

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.980
watches and magical powers" and it told me
frankly nothing

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.980
- "I'm not too games with monsters and magical
powers, it not tell me anything really"

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.160
Finally I'm still going to buy the game, I
also bought all the add on ,that go with it, I was ruined

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.270
I started the installation, but from time to time of installation and updates I had
for hours

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.650
, so I told myself that I would go on the internet to pass the time.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.360
Once the installation is finished, I have created my character, then I had the choice
between several different classes and races, there were so I put 3 hours.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.880
I finally chose a human warrior.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.420
later I will realize that I do not like, race,
class, faction. 
* f***********************ck *

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.560
Then I had to choose a name for my character,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.760
I try darkwarrior was not available, not available
Darkshadow, Darkmaul not available, all names

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.060
DARK was not available.
So I had to call my reference.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.330
I finally found "CHUCK NORRIS"
was not available

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.270
I was super disappointed, I still had no name
for my character

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.250
I watched,
he looked at me,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.550
I watched,
he looked at me,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.460
I've looked, I had finally found
* Kyankhojandi *

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
I validated, then I saw a cutscene.
I thought it was super ugly, because it do

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.600
for months I was playing battlefield 3
I finally started playing, but as it was my

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.030
first MMORPG I do not understand anything.
I then advanced mob I killed, I still advanced,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.250
I still killed mob, I finished a quest, I
took a level.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.330
I was too happy.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.250
When I played with other players, they all called me noob naab peon.
I do not know what it meant, but it was not

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.400
a good sign.
I realized that it really was not a good sign

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.670
when noob and peon are transformed
and in asshole biatch.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.270
that's it, it's been several months since
I played a world of warcraft.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.430
one day a guy asked me to type / played, I
hit / played, 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.880
I saw appear 254 days, 9 hours, 26 minutes and 35 seconds. I've been thinking and I realized that it was almost a year I was sitting in my office
chair doing nothing when I could have done

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.030
 I've been thinking and I realized that it was almost a year I was sitting in my office
chair doing nothing when I could have done something with my life.
at the same time a guy asked me if I wanted

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.170
to do a dungeon.
* you want to do a dungeon? *

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.799
then I told myself that maybe it was time
to take a break.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.080
Then I woke up, I opened my part to watch
the weather, it rained

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.139
I looked at my screen, I looked at the weather,
I re-looked at my screen, I re-watched the

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.900
weather, I closed my part, I sat down, I wrote
but OK we rush.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.760
- * OK * but rush
BREF I was playing world of warcraft.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.760
go go go go go go go go go go go
but damn you're the noob guys.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.719
