00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.639
 People, but once I'm here. 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.650
 for you and today 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.619
 to make the mark here for you as the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.140
 driver's view that you will be 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.039
 driving the car will do at the time of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.079
 test 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.890
 then that old routine before 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:34.610
 get the exam no way regulate bank 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.500
 the mirrors love the mirrors 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.020
 mirrors the law to fill a 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.350
 bit of the car on the other side too 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.800
 not ajeitadinha in the mirror there as 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.340
 your need and the mirror inside 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.040
 The tip I use is always to leave the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.820
 Mirror generated in half to see well 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.050
 this little corner here on the glass of the car 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.710
 at the time of the goal will facilitate 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.960
 and lastly if there is your 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.960
 15 security for you to take 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.720
 on the car 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.260
 first jump handbrake 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.350
 I'm with a Celtic chevrolet signals the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.690
 next you will make the maneuver is'm 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.940
 here in the city of curitiba in the parana 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.310
 there the space of the maneuver where it will be 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.600
 made the goal from the side 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.360
 right 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.940
 Notice that the car is a little bit 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.460
 away you can use as a reference 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.080
 to the windshield column here and the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.280
 of the prototype 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.360
 Let's start there signaling 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:52.040
 Working will lean the car on the side. 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.300
 of this prototype here the vision of the 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.860
 driver 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.630
 careful not to hit so you can 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.260
 give a raise in your body to 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.870
 see more is that this point does not 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.360
 coming back here again 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.110
 The tip I use is to keep a distance 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.930
 here from the rear view mirror until 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.880
 the side of the prototype plus or minus one 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.220
 span 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.220
 is that here you forever to 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.700
 analyze and decide on taboa distance or 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.730
 not that the second care I use as 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.450
 that the cut of the prototype and the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.209
 port column to do this here with 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.660
 they will align more or less of this 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.970
 shape by letting a small 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.270
 prototype only in this region here 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:49.400
 stopped there in the car and 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.450
 turns the steering wheel to one side that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.450
 you will make the mark 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:01.489
 in the case of the right side here is a 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.280
 siren there that has a train that passes 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.569
 close to us here and there you go 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.569
 walking and water 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.260
 then you will use this reference 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.690
 mirror that you 're looking at it until 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.060
 the prototype back there appeared in note 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.600
 that it is starting to appear will 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.360
 walking keep walking and look at the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.600
 Right there on the corner to see 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.390
 I come here so this side goes 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.970
 disappear into this little corner that you 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:41.120
 see here in the glass by the mirror 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:44.390
 rearview will not have to pay goes stopping 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.780
 for it to occur there is no exaggeration so 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.660
 note that there is a little place there disappeared 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:57.230
 to turn the entire steering wheel when 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:04:01.430
 left again signals the report of the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.340
 maneuver and now you will see only the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.069
 The car's trajectory can use the front 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.400
 here as reference 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.739
 then the car starts to fit into the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:20.780
 wave can see through the mirror aquino side 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:23.630
 also and there you will walk to him or 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.160
 I hit the curb that was my case 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.160
 here the rear wheel 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.110
 the front wheel is far 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.500
 Look how good the car is. 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.889
 disproportionate with the vacancy what I go 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.849
 make swallow seas 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.849
 I'm going to turn 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.599
 all the steering wheel to the right side 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:57.910
 right to the right 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:02.290
 signs again changed to the first 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.340
 march and now I'm going to fix the part of 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:11.080
 front of the car here 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:14.410
 until it is straight with the prototype 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.250
 here he got lined up took two 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.250
 steering wheel laps 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:25.390
 Sorry, he checked the alignment. 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.750
 behind the mirror can get people here 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.330
 sees the prototype that he's right here 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.730
 aligned with the side of our car and 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:40.630
 also in the other mirror also gives to 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.850
 see the prototype right here and he's 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.830
 aligned with the side of our car 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.540
 so the distance we are in the middle 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.320
 the correct gold thread because you 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.030
 need to do then turned the brake on 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.750
 hand 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.050
 now to remove the car from this location 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.200
 the hand brake as the distance in the 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.500
 front is too short to engage the 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.400
 reverse or create a space here in the 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.400
 front of car 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:16.420
 can I use it here as a reference? 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.120
 in my vision of the driver the track 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.340
 black for car crash and if both 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.190
 that is appearing here not equivalent 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.670
 a couple of fingers or three in my vision 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.860
 and it usually leaves from here so 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.860
 I'm going to turn the steering wheel all the way to the left. 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.950
 that the output side to the signaling 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.950
 to the side that needs to engage the 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:42.610
 first gear and take the car seat 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:47.380
 here on my way out I'll give it to you 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:50.040
 hit this corner here and I'll untap 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.160
 car here he 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.590
 it is necessary until the marking 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.960
 tank on the floor that is to pass there 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:03.810
 red and does not exceed the 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:07.260
 yellow here stopped the reverse gear 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.030
 the positioning of the car through the 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.510
 rear view here 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.870
 the two prototypes there the parallel pilot 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.130
 with them not to beat 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.970
 note that the car retains the same 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.760
 no no distance decreases increases 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.850
 space 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.680
 so I just keep walking without me 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.010
 worry that there is no danger of maintaining 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.610
 if that's the case I'll give you a squeeze 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:42.520
 in him 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:46.199
 and brought him to the end disengages brake 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.199
 turn the car off and on
