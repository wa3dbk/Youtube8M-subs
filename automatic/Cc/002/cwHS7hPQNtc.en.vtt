but you can get knocked around its had a

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.240 
but you can get knocked around its had a
few<00:03:51.120> bumps<00:03:51.270> already<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:54.410> I'll<00:03:55.410> put<00:03:55.710> up<00:03:55.920> at

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
few bumps already and I I'll put up at

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.220 
few bumps already and I I'll put up at
the<00:03:56.400> m<00:03:58.340> she<00:03:59.340> don<00:03:59.520> and<00:04:00.120> got<00:04:00.990> these<00:04:01.110> little

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
the m she don and got these little

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.380 
the m she don and got these little
grooves<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:01.920> which<00:04:02.130> reflect<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.120> lens

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
grooves in it which reflect the lens

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.640 
grooves in it which reflect the lens
light<00:04:04.080> think<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.520> it<00:04:05.640> doesn't<00:04:06.030> fit<00:04:06.270> in<00:04:06.390> here

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
light think that it doesn't fit in here

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.720 
light think that it doesn't fit in here
so<00:04:07.650> just<00:04:07.680> have<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.100> take<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.340> out<00:04:08.490> separately

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
so just have to take this out separately

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.300 
so just have to take this out separately
and<00:04:10.730> let's<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:11.820> put<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.360> on<00:04:12.570> that's<00:04:13.260> up

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
would be obviously okay put this for a
