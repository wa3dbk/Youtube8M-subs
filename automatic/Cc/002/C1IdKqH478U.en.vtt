00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 once a nice good day here in the 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.430
 movie lounge his new episode hard movie 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.770
 and today I want to talk about it 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.330
 How is books really one ? 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.160
 This is not going to be made into a movie 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.799
 pretty boring or annoying ourselves 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.179
 about it when suddenly things changed 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.920
 we will still be the couple most of all 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.130
 have read years in the book that is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.330
 today the topic at hawx we already 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.980
 talked about what is actually 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.900
 With this victory, there was always there 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 more second third fourth parts here 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 There are also more and more adapted 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.210
 scripts by namely books 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.320
 a film will be rewritten from it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.450
 I do not want to be done right now 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.489
 talk about that is great and now 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.280
 creative, but how does it look? 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 How should books basically be 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.670
 be filmed I actually know it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 basically when a movie in the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.570
 Cinemas is based on a book 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.129
 Often never heard of this book 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.110
 heard does not matter 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.789
 are people reading this book 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.559
 so the self-proclaimed experts of the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 So these are the same 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 Supporter of everything and say no 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.809
 there was something changed that works 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.670
 not at all he does not have 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.770
 dark blond hair in the book but blond 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 he is described I always find 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.070
 honestly a bit hard 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.680
 would like to justify that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.150
 because we are talking here of them that it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.450
 once in book and once in the film 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.070
 two completely different media we 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.100
 once have a book like that 34 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.750
 Has 500 pages or more in which 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.159
 really detailed individual thoughts 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.380
 be described and we have once 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 a film of two hours at best 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.570
 audio visual entertainment should deliver 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.340
 and visually into a world with us 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.200
 one also musically brings the whole thing 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.670
 accompanied and so they say yes even if 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.079
 you read then it's your own 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.159
 fantasy man poses himself 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.380
 Somehow, something 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.210
 and that would mean about everyone 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 would have to please everyone 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.680
 individual reader exactly his own 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.909
 to be filmed one by one 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.500
 but we do not need it for that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.329
 you have that fantasy that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
 is just let this movie 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.060
 take place once in your imagination 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.159
 if you say more like that now 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.979
 history and then we'll have a look 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 let's see what filmmakers make of it 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.640
 my opinion and you have to at all 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.439
 do not share and that is now believed 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.420
 I even the topic where we even on 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.070
 most of them so far at ahold film 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.869
 can discuss because in my view 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.179
 it is so boring it is rather me 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.970
 when a book tells exactly one to one 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.410
 and not 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.090
 the opportunity to say so 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.030
 a medium would have worked for me 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.650
 quite different from a risen book than 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.600
 a written story and man 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.970
 give themselves their own aspects of introducing 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.680
 I find that much more exciting than that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.420
 just like to make one to one and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.280
 you could also interpret something 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.080
 or you say okay the figure I think 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.790
 super exciting, I give it now 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.010
 a little more room the man for it 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.980
 Forget a side script is 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.550
 about a minute in the film roundabout 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.200
 a page script a page movie one 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.110
 minute movie if you survive now time 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.540
 and when a book with 500 pages is one too 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.130
 one would be implemented 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.959
 also in the script and that would be 500 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.560
 pages script this movie wants 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.390
 no one really sees it 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.980
 be shortened and I think it's good 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.500
 if your script authors say themselves 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.790
 hey we bring our own version 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.050
 in now we find this 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.850
 by-story not so important 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.500
 maybe a part is somehow for 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.100
 the emotional development of the figure 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.480
 our perspective more meaningful and that 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.250
 I just think that's important 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.560
 his own painting gives so that the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.440
 history maybe also for the people 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.630
 the book does not work better 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.950
 because I have just asked that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.540
 me whenever i say okay the book 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.610
 Now I have read the movie but so 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.680
 and so I think I see that one 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.810
 always argues well if you do that 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.000
 would have read book then you would 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.340
 yes, we understand at the point that 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.590
 is another medium why should 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.900
 a movie that is not money anymore 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.170
 should play as the book on and for 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.700
 yourself 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.049
 should also just the people 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.090
 address the book not read 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.440
 because if a film the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.230
 conditions to watch a movie 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.209
 is the book would have read 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.920
 no one else to make a movie 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.320
 only history has to be like that 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.060
 be compressed that it works 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.730
 and that's what you understand 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.590
 how do you see that now I say so 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.420
 I read the book that is now 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.330
 the story belongs to me that is 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.040
 My, everything just as well 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.260
 since he got the people who say no 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.610
 I really liked that completely 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.530
 He would also like a reason 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.900
 so why do you find that? 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.190
 why is that important to you or says 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.630
 yes, no, I really want to 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.150
 another work is both that 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.729
 written as well as an audiobook 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.830
 a series or the film is another 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.870
 medium i see that in any case 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.120
 this way and would me 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.250
 if just the filmmakers still happy 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.990
 Become more courageous if you have such a substance 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.440
 say okay okay I'll adopt that now 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.389
 history 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.100
 I take that as a template and now 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.780
 make something out of it for me 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.820
 Of course , that does not mean that either 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.070
 if you, for example, the main character on 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.470
 she dies in the movie at the end 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.990
 Of course, life has to be in some way 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.000
 way, this frame should be there 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.259
 otherwise there's no adaptation but 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.930
 Let the people a bit more 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.580
 creativity and not just that 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.750
 to make this money press because 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.880
 that is also a problem for me 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.979
 the movies are often not good because 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.990
 they are according to schema f are from a to z 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.789
 to work it all off 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.440
 that does not make it any exciting 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.570
 and I always have the feeling you want 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.520
 but really only the mourning notice 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.900
 let the filmmakers a bit 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.990
 more space I am now about yours 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.250
 opinion incredibly curious about yours 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.510
 opinion incredibly curious and 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.060
 At the same time, I would like to 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.130
 you know when a lot is which 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.780
 filming you find very successful and 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.490
 for whatever reason and what not 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.229
 you know 100 films are the 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.729
 by no means am comments in all 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.440
 me about the reading into individual 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.930
 try to answer a bit so 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.940
 likes to write there if the last one 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.669
 missed the series because it was about one 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.650
 another topic big surprise 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.360
 I link you down here on the left 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.550
 actually become quite nice 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.630
 cinema really becoming more expensive or is that 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.729
 really just a myth 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.229
 if now but say the tab 2 was there 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.849
 it was not a real book for 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.409
 nevertheless filmed siri gives us below 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.820
 on the right also a nice competition 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.650
 It looks like we'll see then 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.419
 hopefully see you soon again if you have the 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.400
 You have subscribed to this channel at the latest 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.510
 should do with the man as you help now 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.510
 man does that well
