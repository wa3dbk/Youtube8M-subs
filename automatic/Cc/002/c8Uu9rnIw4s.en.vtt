hi everybody welcome to dolly dorm diaries 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.690
first YouTube video yeah we've been
really excited and thinking about this

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.990
for a long time

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.320
and we thought with Easter coming up

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.350
it would be a great time to talk about
how you can put together

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.480
Easter baskets for your American Girl
doll so

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.730
we decided to gather up lots a little
goodies from

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.800
various places we have baskets that
we got from Hobby Lobby

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.859
and we already had the grass

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.140
you can use any kind grass you can find
anyplace

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.300
and then we picked up all these goodies
so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.409
let's look at those a little closer and
talk about where they came from okay

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.179
so here we have these adorable little
rubber bunnies they're perfectly doll

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.719
sized for your American Girl doll basket

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.280
then we have some various different
things that we collected over the years

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.729
for our dolls but I did just see the
same miniature

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.250
bubbles at target and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.150
actually I think also at Five Below you can
use these

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.690
super cute fuzzy chickies and lots of you probably already have those

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.770
sitting around the house

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.760
if not you can pick them up in different
places like Target and CVS

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.320
we definitely had had Cadbury's eggs
those are so yummy

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.590
they came from let's see they came from
Five Below

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.660
then we have these cute cute cute little
bunnies

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.430
they are only a couple inches tall and
they came from Michaels 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.440
these chocolate covered

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.700
yogurt covered raisins came from Target
and the Smarties

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.410
eggs came from Five Below

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.190
yep and then these adorable

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.700
chocolate bunnies in little itty bitty boxes
they were only 50 cents

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.470
each at Five Below as well and the last
thing

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.080
was some stickers that we got from and
the Dollar Tree

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.459
Dollar Tree is a great place to get little doll sized things because everythings a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:08.989
dollar

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.569
and you don't have to spend a whole lot
to have fun making something up for your

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.060
dolls

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.340

that we're gonna start

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.340

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.569

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.440

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.090
