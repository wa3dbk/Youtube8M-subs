00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 It turns out St. Petersburg compared to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.700
 Muscovites they spend more time in 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.649
 Internet rather than Muscovites but it is very 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.469
 relative and numbers it is clear that the numbers 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.590
 taken on average but Petersburgers 40 one 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.480
 minute 12 seconds average day exclude 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.230
 38 minutes 4070 he doesn't seem much 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.449
 I personally only watch videoblogger 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.670
 I do not know an hour and a half well, again, when 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 I have time I take it away from sleep 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 late-late especially such bloggers 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 as our guest today is a pleasure 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 I represent Konstantin Zarutsky good 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.200
 hello well they call you not only 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.989
 called your channel in orbits exactly in 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.570
 comments they call me very 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.750
 differently sometimes how bruce to voice is not 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.020
 format for television did not break 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.030
 a blogger is just like that 90 percent 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.680
 Bloggers have become bloggers just well 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.629
 what if you want to be a blogger for 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.100
 money and fame you have nothing 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.480
 will let us make it clear as 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.789
 contemptuous than you do what you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.340
 highlight what you tell in what in 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.250
 which plan in which was 8 one 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.380
 screen all special cover under 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.299
 which is already hiding the motor and he 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 is here at that depth that is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.530
 when you want to add oil you 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.530
 open her shout horses 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.689
 I saw down there must you answer 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.509
 Kazatin here you are always looking for some 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.790
 unusual approaches to the car from 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.579
 undertake such ideas ideas come from 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.310
 spontaneously we have no script but the main 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.740
 the bottom line is that the perfect auto reviewer and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.900
 there may be a test driver before the set of kuga on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.329
 due in the four hours he has 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.850
 car do so he must 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.890
 see what the host sees for three 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.479
 years and look very quickly 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.070
 tricky actually here of the so -called 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.890
 as you voiced reviewers now in 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.049
 There are a lot of trees in the Internet 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.119
 up men and women and old people and children 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.070
 little they all talk about 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.930
 cars you chose your such 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 branded chip you do it with 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.700
 so peculiar to you you are a petersburger 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.900
 root yes now I feel that root 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.850
 such Petersburg 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.920
 the mayor is present is present 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.930
 from cartoons, that's when you realized that 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.730
 precisely need so serve the viewer or you 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.350
 still in creative search i 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.450
 naturally creative in creative 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.040
 searching but the original concept is 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.870
 Was still before I was shooting about 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.610
 cars I mean cars 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.440
 I treat condescendingly that is so 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 know a man who is 10 years old on one 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 Transportation vehicles he already knows it all 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.010

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.070
 years you have a driver's license with 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.660
 how many years but it is now 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.120

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.740
 knows and this is a secret yes ok well here 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.000

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.110
 earnings to interest 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.430
 To be precise, it's beautiful 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.250
 earning on you for this need 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.200
 spend years two i have been doing this 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.330

 130 Well this is how much you can earn so 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.940
 the quality of the record is our earnings 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.310
 happened in December of this year, it 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.530
 about seventy-five thousand rubles a 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.480
 January there was a collapse crisis and in January 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.920
 we will have to talk about 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.300
 what happened in January tell me you never 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.570
 did not think here for example to do a review on 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.060
 towel yes yes you look now 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.370
 just look at the plot of our colleague 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.110
 Maxim Rusanov, he just makes you 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.940
 tests doing reviews on the towel 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.860
 lost time let's see how to do it 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.330
 right and then you just judge 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.130
 interest to choose towels only for 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.010
 soft and comfortable terry towel 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.380
 takes over quality time has no power 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.000
 Well, we have such reviews do it on 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.920
 channel St. Petersburg is wonderful 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.410
 really max thanks so much 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.630
 constantin you the question is clear that the guy 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.340
 it is clear that the machines are all around the machines 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.870
 me all my life around the car to me this 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.940
 very interesting but was there ever 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.220
 when such a fantastic idea that not 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.410
 know on doing reviews on the pillow 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.660
 a heap on flowers something 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.580
 Exactly the perfect reviewer 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.430
 can make a review on a black screen and 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.019
 people will watch it 40 minutes but in 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.120
 of this understanding, the bear went under the format 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.530
 maybe we need search queries that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.840
 people are more likely to search if you want 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.000
 popularity are considering what 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.760
 popular if tomorrow will be popular 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.299
 I consider everything from a pillow only 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.099
 pillows cushions 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.199
 learn and always because we are nâ€™t 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.210
 money with them definitely must be forced 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.530
 meet the popular your head well not 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.759
 in youtube popular if we have a theme here 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.759
 they chose to their liking 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.139
 pillows if you want popularity you 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.729
 need to do what is trend and you need 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.220

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.520
 you do not need any advertising you should do 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.960
 interesting video all topic any for 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.210
 for this you need some kind of super 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.889
 video camera for this you need there type 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.300
 the breather to hang something under it 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.800
 mobile phone camera text 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.360
 which but which will be a little bit 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.370
 to orient a person who will 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.110
 tell me you need to remove one step 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.080
 about which stumble in a hundred percent 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.629
