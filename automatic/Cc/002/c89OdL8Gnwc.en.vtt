00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.849
 hello to all hello to all here bono 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.419
 I'm with Antoine Cuckoo 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.090
 everybody 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.210
 today we are two to succeed in 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.279
 beat sartre to riom mode too dragon 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.020
 that is to say that the holes these three 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.870
 little darling friends convoy in the corner of 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.420
 the screen and a behind come to help him 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 during the battle 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.950
 so we would not have denied the clean 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.140
 age but in fact you have trouble doing 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.289
 just everything follows the monsters that 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.089
 are self bumps because otherwise 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.260
 you are going to have big problems 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.749
 during the final six woods that is 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.159
 certainly to riom I want to show you 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.199
 but in fact to vouziers that the measure 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.030
 will not be 100% if we do it with the 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.390
 holes and bumps the holes and three 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.819
 dragons 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.219
 so it's convenient for those who 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:04.940
 want a mount easily and that's it 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.130
 so let's go we'll hurry because 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.750
 that I am in dep and is otherwise in island 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.270
 then it's quite difficult 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 I confirm so dps thoroughly yes me 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.149
 also I will hurry to be able to 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.149
 attack as quickly as possible 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 at the last last 750 code life I 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.789
 does my bosses actually what yes and the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.799
 end and europe and this because the three 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.710
 dragons are then in addition to some 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.340
 lions then it becomes pretty 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:52.920
 difficult exactly thanks 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:56.939
 ok ok for now this butterfly thing 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.349
 5.5 to the ray games survive yes oh 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.759
 against me by maybe 200 agreement 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:06.700
 waited to die 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.369
 also the 6-0 yes but that's sir 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.250
 excitement to Russia like you but 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.310
 see it's going to be a little course building 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.120
 for m because the mount is draped at 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.910
 100% so 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.390
 so here you see the motive I'm going 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.500
 can you show it to the state 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.069
 I am the pole friends because I have 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.760
 already acquired so here is more there is 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.440
 gains actually it's all added seven 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.600
 I won the mount part won the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.720
 bag of bottles 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.110
 as always there is no ready drac 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.970
 black I have here I see go out to 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.959
 outside to be able to do it 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.200
 to contemplate yeah that's it I 'm going to 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.590
 follow my dear friend perfect perfect handsome 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.020
 fight 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.580
 frankly 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.940
 it's been done twice 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.370
 is for you we have died at least two 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.810
 time 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.840
 but what do you want it does not hold when 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.900
 we want you to try so we have it 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.650
 done twice so reindeer black drac 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.620
 goes up and that's what looks like 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.820
 mount that looks a lot drac and 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.260
 bronze except with other colors 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:30.180
 Note that this single player mode is a 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.600
 mode of 10.6 be exactly and there is 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.450
 another mount that will be pushed to 100% 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.260
 of chances in lagoon mode 3 except that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.420
 25 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.320
 so that makes you two mounts 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.860
 relatively simple to have so that's 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.020
 the end of this video there if you only have 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.120
 you liked to share it is 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.400
 always very nice sessions in either 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.710
