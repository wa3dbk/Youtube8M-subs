00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello how about everyone good in this video 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:11.769
 it's fast it 's a request from a user 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:14.049
 of youtube asks me what in the botxo 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 which place is the best to place the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.400
 good stereo 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 in response I can tell you that a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.260
 place exists the designated place for 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
 place the stereo that is this here in 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.240
 the board but the place the place 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 correct depends on everyone up to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.470
 a certain point I can tell you that a place 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.440
 correct does not exist because everything depends 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.410
 how you have your installation is to say if 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 you want to have good in this country 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.620
 unfortunately you can not have the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.129
 things without someone thinking 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.130
 want to take away the new rob us 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.329
 expensive glass and that we steal it good 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.500
 It depends on what you look for if 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.760
 you want discretion 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.790
 If this is because it is good or in a place 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.040
 or maybe you have some fear that you 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.479
 get to crist area of ​​the car or 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.020
 he simply wants to be discreet 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.820
 you can use the glove compartment and many 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 have used the glove box to place 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.420
 there your stereo 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.880
 even if you no longer use discs 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.700
 compact for example for the glove compartment 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.710
 is very good because unfortunately the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.479
 color the place the car stereo here 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 in the glove compartment because you need a support 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.700
 no and many people place it here 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.500
 directly now in the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.210
 unfortunately the suspension of the botxo 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.369
 of the cushioning are so rigid that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.110
 Any jump and any jump 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.539
 Well, it's going to be that your CDs and 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.600
 your music skip here and it's going to mismatch 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.689
 the store laser and it will damage it 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.610
 but it is a stereo or situates customs 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.789
 already uses digital media such as memory 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.289
 usb or the assistant to send music 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.759
 from your cell phone so place it here 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.080
 there's no problem for example good in 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.549
 some time in the history of this 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.860
 I came to bring car stereo here 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.740
 from experience I tell you that if you go to 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.470
 use this compact discs as you do not not 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.750
 I highly recommend that you place it there and 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.210
 better use the space that is for 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.300
 not that 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.580
 What I can recommend is that you do not 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.370
 cuts or if you are going to use it here 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.160
 if you are going to put all this here and no 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.840
 you have for example already drilling the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.270
 board do not go to cut the frame 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.970
 respect to this is to say so and so not what 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.460
 go cut your board because you're going to 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.880
 stay with too much space goes to 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.410
 be loose and it will look bad short what 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.620
 first cut with respect to the frame of your 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.980
 stereo so it's saying taking these 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.890
 interior measurements so that it stays that way and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 do not leave space and do not leave a 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.650
 space that is not too deep 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.860
 autostereo is more than anything so that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.270
 have then of where to hold on not and good 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.220
 if you want to put it here I'll 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.090
 I recommend that you make a modification to 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.520
 the glove box and place you order to make a 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.770
 frame for the stereo car to 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.880
 place here and not screw it in 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.760
 here in that way you will not hurt 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.230
 but well probably if you have a 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.710
 vochito that will be from 1990 to trasvasaba 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.790
 carve a bit in place it here because 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:27.580
 the rolls from the 90 back did not bring 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.010
 this how can I tell you this 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.600
 predisposed hole for the radio 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.150
 of the radio was smaller more make 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.140
 mind that he is like this if 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.080
 should be changed back 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.680
 of the board that is the metal so that 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.940
 the stereo will be fine 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.940
 but in reality there is not much that 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.060
 to say about this topic is rather to your 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.520
 I like what you're looking for 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.310
 I say if you are looking for an installation 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.780
 so you can see that there is no problem or 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.300
 maybe it does not look like that anymore 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.860
 it depends more on your choice but if 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.420
 there is a predisposed place for the radio 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.510
 Well, this is not 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.459
 it's up to you, finally I hope to have you 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.340
 could help if you had any questions 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.440
 Well, you tell me right here in the in the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.239
 Question area and I will gladly 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.799
 I answer and maybe I'll get you some 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.389
 ideas 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.870
