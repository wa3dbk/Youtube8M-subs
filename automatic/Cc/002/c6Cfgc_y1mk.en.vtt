00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.559

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.800
 so as you understood I am 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.019
 glad it's finally nice we finally 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.660
 will not arrange the sweaters and put on 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.239
 little dog so then already for 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.679
 start hello everyone 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:23.949
 this time I would like to talk to you in 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.269
 makes poufs because it's the season 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.439
 start right now there is more 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.050
 really in season because there would be 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.050
 a little toulon year but here it is with 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.910
 heats it is true that there is more than 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.170
 EVault cloud problem schools so 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.870
 so first a loo these are small 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.370
 beasts that actually eat I feel it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.930
 that they suck the blood done in on the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.980
 scalp of your toddlers or even 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.320
 on you maybe too 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.550
 and the problem is that by force 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.860
 to use insecticide treatments 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.870
 that we buy in pharmacy they are 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.150
 become really old but there are 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.060
 still natural products that 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.370
 who still resists a lot so 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.180
 you must also know that the louse does not jump 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.620
 not do not fly do not swim so they get 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.780
 transmit really done here it 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.330
 going from head to head due to a hat 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.690
 a cap or on a bus folder 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.490
 or there how to recognize a pulse and 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.730
 a slow then already a little it looks like 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730
 to that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.860
 the c1 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.840
 Congratulations so it's more of a color 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.729
 grayish or even duduche color 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.240
 so in fact they are mostly located on the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.940
 scalp 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.580
 so just look at you 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.960
 look at it on the leather 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.630
 hairy see if you have not the little ones 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.780
 babies then the moors it looks like 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.780
 it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.190
 no 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.830
 a film that has nothing to do with a 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.120
 film rims are small 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.910
 hours in fact they are hooked to 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.220
 level of the hair root that are 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.320
 on every hair actually pulled nine by 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 hair and when you shoot it 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.720
 remain the rest hooked 6 6 the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.190
 loeuff actually slip you between 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.990
 hands and you get to take off actually 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.910
 all along the hair that means that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.729
 the slow is actually dead 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.009
 then to also avoid that areas 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.880
 hatched too quickly, avoid all 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.070
 all kinds wine any source of heat 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.990
 intense kind her hair placali it's 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.280
 all this must be avoided otherwise it's done 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.840
 hatch them had a lot faster 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.910
 all the tricks I'm going to you 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.100
 give is used for at least 15 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.310
 days because the eyes actually it's 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.870
 their incubation time so that use 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.390
 once or twice a week during 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.790
 fifteen days and every day 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.990
 pass and the little comb in fact that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.520
 you will find in pharmacy these are 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.300
 very small teeth to remove in 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.830
 do the nits 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.220
 the airlock has used against all 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.890
 days for to remove the nits that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.600
 who stays hooked so firstly 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.670
 you can use olive oil 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.730
 so you take you from the books you 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.590
 you apply on damp hair on 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.810
 all the head you put the senate and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.660
 you leave a minimum of one hour 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.300
 even all day or night 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.590
 good night is not good for 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.980
 able to sleep but that's at least the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.569
 day to really smother the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.100
 balance sheets and if you have any 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.180
 the essential oil of lavender you 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.239
 can put a few drops too 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.640
 in hall 8 olive and that's it for 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.220
 you enter a field mask 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.810
 give him then there is vinegar 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.190
 white to you do not need 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.840
 to moisten the hair you put 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.280
 directly in fact white vinegar 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.709
 done on the on the head 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.269
 you of course massage the hair and the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.600
 scalp and let you pose 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.340
 like an hour to a whole day 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.989
 if you do a fortnight actually 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.269
 you always have momentum always 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.620
 lice while you passed the peg ii 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.880
 every time you have one last 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.130
 luck on the other hand that's really 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.920
 last year's case as a last resort 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.060
 instead of mowing the hair you 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.650
 can you do a coloring 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.090
 in fact they marry do not like 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.310
 ammonia actually that has in the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.750
 in the colorations then not use 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.129
 pure ammonia is not worth it 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.260
 would be way too dangerous for you 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.989
 but by cons there in coloring this 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.680
 effective then once you are 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.260
 well cleared of the remains there is 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.780
 lice heads so as to avoid 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.430
 for them to come back you can 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.460
 simply use on a brush to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.080
 girls a few drops of essence 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.280
 lavender 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.720
 you put in more than a few drops 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.949
 on the brush and you free it's in 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.340
 do everyday hair with 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.260
 for guys we can put some 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.560
 disgusting done behind the ear in 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.320
 the caps in the cups and that's it 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.419
 especially in times in fact all where 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.600
 the husband arrives at school as soon as you 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.010
 actually have a little poster at 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.490
 the school of your children here 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.620
 not 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.539
 better to prevent than after 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.460
 to get rid of it is more 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.310
 difficult 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.840
 it is also necessary if your child or you 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.360
 you madam you sir you who me 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.560
 look if you have lice it's worth 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.260
 better also avoid going into 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.660
 public places armp cinema with the 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.639
 benches the buses the quarters if 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.840
 really you have no choice 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.590
 here you are attaching your hair to you 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.270
 put on a cap or subscribers 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.120
 a scarf or that's what you want 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.610
 but you but avoid contaminating the 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.900
 others and the device 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.900
 avoid taking appointments at the 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.010
 hairdresser because without him without the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.660
 actually prevent you from having lice 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.160
 because he can deny you access in 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.120
 made 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.620
 finally he can refuse to take care of 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.510
 here you are in relation to 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.720
 accounting which is very easy in 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.830
 done by the tools here I hope that 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.540
 I was pretty clear in my 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.640
 explanations if you have questions 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.400
