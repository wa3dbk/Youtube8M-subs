this<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:50.250> yet<00:00:50.489> again<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.210> greatness

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this then yet again we can see greatness

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
this then yet again we can see greatness
because<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.020> continue<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.770> casing<00:00:53.160> how

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because if we continue so casing how

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
because if we continue so casing how
much<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> threat<00:00:53.910> Alvarez<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.199> they're

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
what Auguste said and Auguste looks like

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
what Auguste said and Auguste looks like
an<00:01:19.140> old<00:01:19.350> timer<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.799> he<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.070> tell<00:01:20.250> definitely

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
an old timer that he can tell definitely

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390 
an old timer that he can tell definitely
and<00:01:20.970> he<00:01:21.060> had<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.360> say<00:01:21.600> buzzer<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.280> have

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and he had to say buzzer it would have

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.920 
and he had to say buzzer it would have
been<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> massacre<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.570> honestly

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
been a massacre right there and honestly

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
been a massacre right there and honestly
I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> would<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.770> been<00:01:25.890> more<00:01:26.040> fine<00:01:26.400> with

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
lightning striking this motherfucker

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.149 
lightning striking this motherfucker
that<00:01:34.170> would<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.500> been<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.979> mean

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
that would have been all right I mean

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.020 
that would have been all right I mean
granny<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.610> been<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> sneak<00:01:35.939> attack

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
granny would have been a sneak attack

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.280 
granny would have been a sneak attack
but<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.420> again<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.630> fairy<00:01:36.810> tale<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.140> don't

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
but then again a fairy tale they don't

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.210

give<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> fuck<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:37.860> play<00:01:37.950> by<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> rules

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
give a fuck they don't play by the rules

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010

higher-ups<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.620> gonna<00:02:50.740> be<00:02:50.890> able<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.130> do<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.580> I

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
higher-ups are gonna be able to do and I

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.310 
higher-ups are gonna be able to do and I
guess<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.910> also<00:02:52.060> showcases<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> little<00:02:53.080> bit<00:02:53.200> of

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
guess it also showcases a little bit of

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.440 
guess it also showcases a little bit of
camaraderie<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.430> sense<00:02:54.700> why<00:02:54.910> all<00:02:55.180> gets

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
camaraderie in a sense why all gets

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.640 
camaraderie in a sense why all gets
