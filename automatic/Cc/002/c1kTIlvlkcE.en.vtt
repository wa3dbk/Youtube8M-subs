00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
won't come along later and say this is

thought about this was later that the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.339

of<00:05:52.469> the<00:05:52.650> Hebrews<00:05:53.069> was<00:05:53.339> not<00:05:53.580> enough<00:05:53.909> for<00:05:54.089> them

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:54.589 
of the Hebrews was not enough for them

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.969 
of the Hebrews was not enough for them
they<00:05:55.589> needed<00:05:55.830> something<00:05:56.430> else<00:05:57.289> and<00:05:58.289> that's

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
they needed something else and that's

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.360

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930 
by the Hebrews because he certainly

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.420 
by the Hebrews because he certainly
