all<00:00:00.120> right<00:00:00.240> what<00:00:00.359> I'm<00:00:00.420> going<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.570> do<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:00.870> is

00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:01.199 
all right what I'm going to do now is

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.010 
all right what I'm going to do now is
use<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.860> Machine<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.520> demonstrate<00:00:03.149> well<00:00:03.840> how

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
use the Machine and demonstrate well how

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.860 
use the Machine and demonstrate well how
it's<00:00:04.290> used<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:05.339> pick<00:00:05.490> up<00:00:05.640> some<00:00:06.390> pallets<00:00:06.690> off

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
it's used to pick up some pallets off

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.500 
it's used to pick up some pallets off
this<00:00:07.109> stack<00:00:07.440> here<00:00:08.059> probably<00:00:09.059> not<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
this stack here probably not the

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.120 
this stack here probably not the
situation<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.230> you're<00:00:10.590> probably<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:11.070> a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
situation you have you're probably in a

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.259 
situation you have you're probably in a
warehouse<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.610> racking<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.090> type<00:00:12.210> of

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
warehouse with racking that type of

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.299 
warehouse with racking that type of
thing<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:13.080> just<00:00:13.320> want<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.620> demonstrate<00:00:13.830> how

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
thing I just want to demonstrate how

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.010 
thing I just want to demonstrate how
maneuverable<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.849> thing<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.150> now<00:00:15.299> I've<00:00:15.599> got

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
maneuverable this thing is now I've got

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.689 
maneuverable this thing is now I've got
it<00:00:16.139> set<00:00:16.410> up<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.680> I've<00:00:16.770> given<00:00:17.010> myself<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.609> know

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it set up and I've given myself you know

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.120 
it set up and I've given myself you know
about<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.330> average<00:00:18.480> width<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.680> warehouse

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
about the average width of a warehouse

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.359 
about the average width of a warehouse
aisle<00:00:21.410> approximately<00:00:22.410> nine<00:00:22.590> feet<00:00:22.920> some<00:00:23.250> are

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
aisle approximately nine feet some are

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
aisle approximately nine feet some are
bigger<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:23.789> are<00:00:23.869> narrower<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.199> we'll<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
bigger some are narrower but we'll just

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.250 
bigger some are narrower but we'll just
use<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.580> you'll<00:00:27.150> get<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> good<00:00:27.660> idea<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
use that and you'll get a good idea of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.259 
use that and you'll get a good idea of
how<00:00:28.310> maneuverable<00:00:29.310> how<00:00:29.640> tight<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.060> thing

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
how maneuverable how tight this thing

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.740 
how maneuverable how tight this thing
can<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:31.050> turn<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.910> getting

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
can can turn and really you know getting

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600 
can can turn and really you know getting
yourself<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.320> position<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.100> pick<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.489> load

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
yourself in position to pick up a load

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.190 
yourself in position to pick up a load
which<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> trickiest<00:00:36.780> things<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
which is one of the trickiest things to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.810 
which is one of the trickiest things to
do<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.530> any<00:00:37.680> forklift<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> particularly

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
do with any forklift and particularly

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.639 
do with any forklift and particularly
these<00:00:39.030> things<00:00:39.270> because<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.320> tight

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
these things because of the that tight

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.250 
these things because of the that tight
turning<00:00:41.100> ability<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.110> as

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
turning ability of them all right now as

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.069 
turning ability of them all right now as
I<00:00:43.350> approach<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> stack<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.750> I'm<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I approach the stack here I'm going to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.959 
I approach the stack here I'm going to
actually<00:00:46.590> get<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.219> closer<00:00:47.610> than<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
actually get a little closer than the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
actually get a little closer than the
stack<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.510> normally<00:00:48.570> would<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.350> another

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
stack that I normally would with another

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
stack that I normally would with another
type<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> forklift<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> counterbalance

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
type of forklift like a counterbalance

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540 
type of forklift like a counterbalance
machine<00:00:51.530> because<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.340> this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
machine because I know that as this

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
machine because I know that as this
thing<00:00:53.760> turns<00:00:54.059> basically<00:00:54.809> pivots<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
thing turns basically pivots in the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.340 
thing turns basically pivots in the
center<00:00:55.800> my<00:00:56.520> left<00:00:56.879> side<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.109> right

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
center my left side which is your right

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.869 
center my left side which is your right
side<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.710> where<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.039> looking<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.670> going

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
side from where you're looking is going

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.450 
side from where you're looking is going
to<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.210> swing<00:01:00.480> away<00:01:00.870> from<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> stack<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to actually swing away from the stack so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
to actually swing away from the stack so
it<00:01:02.789> may<00:01:03.000> look<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.510> approaching<00:01:03.960> things

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it may look like I'm approaching things

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
it may look like I'm approaching things
too<00:01:04.350> close<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> stack<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
too close to the stack but actually this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 
too close to the stack but actually this
is<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.159> I'm

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
is about right so right about here I'm

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.270 
is about right so right about here I'm
going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> start<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.420> sharp<00:01:09.930> turn<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
going to start a sharp turn in and you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.179 
going to start a sharp turn in and you
can<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.670> how<00:01:11.880> I've<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.060> myself<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:13.189> position

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
can see how I've got myself in position

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
can see how I've got myself in position
basically<00:01:14.790> straight<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> stack<00:01:15.720> right

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
basically straight with the stack right

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.679 
basically straight with the stack right
there<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.729> nice<00:01:17.880> position<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.390> pick

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
there right I'm in nice position to pick

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
there right I'm in nice position to pick
up<00:01:18.840> these<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.439> pallets<00:01:19.890> alright<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.729> I'm

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
up these these pallets alright so I'm

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
up these these pallets alright so I'm
going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> stay<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.920> I'm

going to raise up I know I've got you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.630 
going to raise up I know I've got you
know<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> certain<00:01:25.920> amount<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.189> room<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
know a certain amount of room up there I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.480 
know a certain amount of room up there I
just<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.970> careful<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:28.220> raise<00:01:29.220> right

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
just be careful that I don't raise right

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.260 
just be careful that I don't raise right
into<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.869> rafters<00:01:30.869> or<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> lights

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
into the rafters or the lights

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.180 
into the rafters or the lights
I<00:01:32.300> want<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.900> take<00:01:33.050> a<00:01:33.080> big<00:01:33.290> enough<00:01:33.320> bite<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.010> that

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
I want to take a big enough bite so that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.150 
I want to take a big enough bite so that
my<00:01:34.310> backrest<00:01:34.940> is<00:01:35.150> engaging<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.710> let's<00:01:36.980> say

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
my backrest is engaging so let's say

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.470 
my backrest is engaging so let's say
right<00:01:37.190> there<00:01:37.580> I'll<00:01:37.700> go<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.030> now

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
right there I'll go in now

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.520 
right there I'll go in now
what<00:01:38.720> I'm<00:01:38.780> going<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:38.960> do<00:01:39.110> is<00:01:39.230> I'm<00:01:39.320> going<00:01:39.350> to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.350 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
sneak<00:01:39.770> in<00:01:39.950> as<00:01:40.070> close<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.580> load<00:01:40.850> as<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.090> can

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
sneak in as close to this load as I can

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360 
sneak in as close to this load as I can
but<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:41.930> have<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.320> watch<00:01:42.590> here<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.190> my

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
but what I have to watch here is that my

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.130 
but what I have to watch here is that my
base<00:01:43.640> legs<00:01:43.940> don't<00:01:44.120> run<00:01:44.390> into<00:01:44.660> this<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:45.050> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
base legs don't run into this to the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.930 
base legs don't run into this to the
load<00:01:45.320> okay<00:01:46.160> so<00:01:46.220> I'm<00:01:46.340> going<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.550> get<00:01:46.700> as<00:01:46.820> close

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
load okay so I'm going to get as close

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.719 
load okay so I'm going to get as close
as<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.300> can<00:01:47.570> all<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:51.070> because<00:01:52.070> see<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.580> reach

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
as I can all right because see the reach

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.580 
as I can all right because see the reach
mechanism<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.270> reach<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:53.630> from<00:01:53.840> here<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.320> won't

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
mechanism I reach in from here it won't

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.820 
mechanism I reach in from here it won't
quite<00:01:54.830> make<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.220> in<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.750> right<00:01:57.140> there<00:01:57.530> it's

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
quite make it in so right there it's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.650 
quite make it in so right there it's
about<00:01:58.010> see<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.729> should<00:01:59.000> actually<00:01:59.300> sneak<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.600> a

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
about see I should actually sneak in a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.960 
about see I should actually sneak in a
little<00:01:59.690> more<00:01:59.990> than<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.640> now<00:02:01.640> let's<00:02:01.760> see<00:02:01.850> now

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
little more than that now let's see now

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.969 
little more than that now let's see now
I've<00:02:02.060> taken<00:02:02.210> my<00:02:02.390> foot<00:02:02.720> off<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.200> folks

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
I've taken my foot off of the folks

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.620 
I've taken my foot off of the folks
navel<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.399> dead<00:02:04.580> man<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.060> I'm<00:02:05.149> locked<00:02:05.450> in

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
navel of the dead man so I'm locked in

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.320 
navel of the dead man so I'm locked in
place<00:02:05.840> here<00:02:06.110> right<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.280> now<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.880> reach<00:02:08.060> in

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
place here right so now I can reach in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.270 
place here right so now I can reach in
okay<00:02:08.899> members<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.619> means<00:02:09.830> I'll<00:02:09.979> push<00:02:10.250> that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
okay members that means I'll push that

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.360 
okay members that means I'll push that
top<00:02:10.729> button<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.209> push<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.800> joystick<00:02:12.800> forward

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
top button and push the joystick forward

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.120 
top button and push the joystick forward
and<00:02:14.080> hopefully<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.110> do<00:02:15.230> get<00:02:15.560> all<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.830> way<00:02:15.950> in

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and hopefully I do get all the way in

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.530 
and hopefully I do get all the way in
here<00:02:16.340> because<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:16.730> as<00:02:16.910> close<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.300> get

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
here because that's as close as I get

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.300 
here because that's as close as I get
well<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.170> see<00:02:18.320> I'm<00:02:18.350> not<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.830> as<00:02:18.950> much<00:02:19.190> as

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
well you can see I'm not in as much as

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.040 
well you can see I'm not in as much as
I'd<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> be<00:02:19.880> I'd<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.750> get<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.930> little

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
I'd like to be I'd like to get a little

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.680 
I'd like to be I'd like to get a little
closer<00:02:21.290> but<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.560> can't<00:02:21.800> write<00:02:22.310> my<00:02:22.520> my<00:02:23.209> base<00:02:23.420> legs

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
closer but I can't write my my base legs

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.449 
closer but I can't write my my base legs
will<00:02:23.870> hit<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.140> load<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:24.830> going<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.250> just

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
will hit the load so I'm going to just

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.190 
will hit the load so I'm going to just
basically<00:02:25.670> pretend<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> really

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
basically pretend that this is a really

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.080 
basically pretend that this is a really
heavy<00:02:27.440> load<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.340> would<00:02:28.550> normally<00:02:28.730> do

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
heavy load and what I would normally do

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.370 
heavy load and what I would normally do
that<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.450> would<00:02:29.720> pick<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.050> up

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
that I would pick it up

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.699 
that I would pick it up
and<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:30.770> pick<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.010> up<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.250> bit

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
and I just pick it up a bit

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.229 
and I just pick it up a bit
okay<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.920> I'm<00:02:34.040> actually<00:02:34.250> going<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.760> retract

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
okay and I'm actually going to retract

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.729 
okay and I'm actually going to retract
it<00:02:35.560> okay

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
it okay

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.459 
it okay
back<00:02:37.430> out<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:37.939> a<00:02:38.120> bit<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.900> much<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.290> all<00:02:42.439> I

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
back out just a bit that much is all I

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.309 
back out just a bit that much is all I
need<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.890> I'm<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.189> lower<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.459> again

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.199 

okay<00:02:48.319> now<00:02:48.560> I'm<00:02:48.709> going<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> reach<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:49.280> until<00:02:50.150> I

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
okay now I'm going to reach in until I

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.050 
okay now I'm going to reach in until I
get<00:02:50.359> a<00:02:50.390> good<00:02:50.659> full<00:02:51.019> grip<00:02:51.409> of<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.650> load

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
get a good full grip of that load

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.160 
get a good full grip of that load
because<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.299> heavy<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.629> want<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.959> get<00:02:54.049> my

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
because if it's heavy I want to get my

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.509 
because if it's heavy I want to get my
Forks<00:02:54.560> all<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.890> way<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> nice<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.459> gentle

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
Forks all the way a nice and gentle

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.629 
Forks all the way a nice and gentle
there<00:02:56.299> we<00:02:56.450> go<00:02:56.599> see<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.470> I'm<00:02:57.650> right<00:02:58.250> up<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.549> the

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
there we go see that I'm right up to the

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.580 
there we go see that I'm right up to the
heel<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.909> my<00:02:59.000> fork<00:02:59.299> now<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.079> what<00:03:00.319> I'm<00:03:00.379> gonna<00:03:00.470> do

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
heel of my fork now so what I'm gonna do

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.460 
heel of my fork now so what I'm gonna do
is<00:03:00.709> lift

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.860 

now<00:03:05.040> here's<00:03:05.640> something<00:03:05.910> different<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.660> well

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
now here's something different as well

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.260 
now here's something different as well
with<00:03:07.860> other<00:03:08.040> types<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.580> forklifts<00:03:09.000> let's<00:03:09.150> say

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
with other types of forklifts let's say

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.640 
with other types of forklifts let's say
a<00:03:09.300> counter<00:03:09.690> balance<00:03:09.810> machine<00:03:10.170> you'd<00:03:10.320> be<00:03:10.410> told

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
a counter balance machine you'd be told

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.950 
a counter balance machine you'd be told
to<00:03:10.800> lift<00:03:11.100> then<00:03:11.460> tilt<00:03:11.820> look<00:03:12.450> behind<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.840> back

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
to lift then tilt look behind the back

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.170 
to lift then tilt look behind the back
of<00:03:12.990> it's<00:03:13.290> clear<00:03:13.530> now<00:03:14.160> oftentimes<00:03:14.670> since

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
of it's clear now oftentimes since

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.090 
of it's clear now oftentimes since
you're<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.570> warehouse<00:03:16.200> racking<00:03:16.680> which<00:03:16.860> we're

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
you're in warehouse racking which we're

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.030 
you're in warehouse racking which we're
not<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:17.850> if<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.240> were<00:03:18.450> it's<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.680> tight

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
not here but if we were it's so tight

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.410 
not here but if we were it's so tight
sometimes<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.910> actually<00:03:21.090> have<00:03:21.390> to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
sometimes that you actually have to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.680 
sometimes that you actually have to
retract<00:03:22.080> first<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.950> get<00:03:23.490> clear<00:03:24.210> of<00:03:24.390> your

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
retract first and get clear of your

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.480 
retract first and get clear of your
racking<00:03:25.110> then<00:03:25.620> tilt<00:03:25.950> back<00:03:26.130> because<00:03:26.370> you

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
racking then tilt back because you

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.430 
racking then tilt back because you
simply<00:03:26.730> don't<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.270> room<00:03:27.540> okay

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
simply don't have the room okay

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.160 
simply don't have the room okay
here<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.460> have<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.850> room<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.450> am<00:03:30.840> going

here we do have the room so I am going

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.050 
here we do have the room so I am going
to<00:03:31.260> tilt<00:03:31.470> back<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:32.190> right<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.490> that's<00:03:32.880> my

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
to tilt back all right and that's my

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.430 
to tilt back all right and that's my
middle<00:03:33.480> button<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.870> my<00:03:33.900> joystick

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
middle button on my joystick

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.890 
middle button on my joystick
pull<00:03:34.710> back<00:03:34.910> just<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.060> bit<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.300> back<00:03:36.420> tilts<00:03:36.750> all

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
pull back just a bit of back tilts all

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.230 
pull back just a bit of back tilts all
we<00:03:36.990> need<00:03:37.170> that's<00:03:38.100> good<00:03:38.460> then<00:03:38.940> I'm<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.210> to

we need that's good then I'm going to

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.690 
we need that's good then I'm going to
continue<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.950> retracting<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.070> like<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> retract

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
continue on retracting I like to retract

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.009 
continue on retracting I like to retract
completely

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.530

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
now what I'd like to do is back straight

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.539 
now what I'd like to do is back straight
away<00:03:49.659> from<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.080> stack<00:03:50.440> if<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:51.010> have<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.370> room

I don't have an obstructed vision
there's<00:04:28.539> a<00:04:28.630> lot<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.960> stuff<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.530> front<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.830> me

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
there's a lot of stuff in front of me

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.770 
there's a lot of stuff in front of me
here<00:04:30.130> right<00:04:30.400> there's<00:04:30.639> this<00:04:30.760> grating<00:04:31.389> the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
here right there's this grating the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.779 
here right there's this grating the
backrest<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.620> works<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.100> mast<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.580> load

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
backrest the works of the mast the load

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.850 
backrest the works of the mast the load
itself<00:04:34.000> right<00:04:34.780> so<00:04:35.199> I'm<00:04:35.320> going<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.500> reverse

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
itself right so I'm going to reverse

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.219 
itself right so I'm going to reverse
myself<00:04:36.430> out<00:04:36.639> of<00:04:36.669> here<00:04:36.970> all<00:04:37.270> right<00:04:37.449> so<00:04:38.080> I'm

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
myself out of here all right so I'm

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.570 
myself out of here all right so I'm
going<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.380> be<00:04:38.530> going<00:04:38.740> this<00:04:38.860> way<00:04:39.039> so<00:04:39.100> that's<00:04:39.400> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
going to be going this way so that's the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.510 
going to be going this way so that's the
way<00:04:39.669> I'll<00:04:39.789> look

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.240 

and<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.180> can<00:04:43.330> turn<00:04:43.509> really<00:04:43.780> tight<00:04:45.090> there<00:04:46.090> we<00:04:46.210> go

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
and I can turn really tight there we go

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.990 
and I can turn really tight there we go
probably<00:04:48.250> lower<00:04:48.370> that<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> little<00:04:48.880> more

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
probably lower that a little more

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.640 
probably lower that a little more
actually<00:04:49.419> now<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.840> always<00:04:50.080> have<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.410> be<00:04:50.470> aware

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
actually now I always have to be aware

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.719 
actually now I always have to be aware
notice<00:04:50.919> what<00:04:51.039> I'm<00:04:51.130> doing<00:04:51.370> here<00:04:51.520> is<00:04:51.580> I'm

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
notice what I'm doing here is I'm

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.129 
notice what I'm doing here is I'm
looking<00:04:51.910> out<00:04:52.180> but<00:04:52.330> I'm<00:04:52.479> always<00:04:52.720> under<00:04:53.110> my

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
looking out but I'm always under my

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.260 
looking out but I'm always under my
overhead<00:04:54.009> guard<00:04:54.250> here<00:04:54.520> I'm<00:04:54.940> just<00:04:55.030> going<00:04:55.180> to

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
overhead guard here I'm just going to

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.420 
overhead guard here I'm just going to
lower<00:04:55.389> that<00:04:55.449> down<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.750> bit<00:04:55.870> more<00:04:56.430> that's

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
lower that down a bit more that's

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.059 
lower that down a bit more that's
probably<00:04:57.759> all<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:57.940> can<00:04:58.210> go<00:04:58.500> alright<00:04:59.500> so<00:04:59.800> what

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
probably all I can go alright so what

it now remember if I were in a warehouse

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.010 
it now remember if I were in a warehouse
rack<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.490> was<00:05:32.610> really<00:05:33.060> tight<00:05:33.330> right<00:05:33.540> now<00:05:33.600> I

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
rack that was really tight right now I

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.860 
rack that was really tight right now I
tilt<00:05:34.800> level<00:05:35.100> now<00:05:35.310> right<00:05:36.210> before<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.630> go<00:05:36.810> in
