dcs system and Lionel's TMCC and their

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.080 
dcs system and Lionel's TMCC and their
new<00:00:18.170> legacy<00:00:18.619> system<00:00:19.040> and<00:00:19.220> they've<00:00:19.910> been

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
new legacy system and they've been

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.700 
new legacy system and they've been
asking<00:00:20.390> about<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.780> interchangeability<00:00:21.500> of

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
asking about the interchangeability of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.700 
asking about the interchangeability of
these<00:00:21.950> two<00:00:22.130> systems<00:00:22.600> can<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:23.840> control<00:00:24.200> Lionel

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
these two systems can you control Lionel

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.890 
these two systems can you control Lionel
trains<00:00:25.040> with<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:25.460> MTH<00:00:25.880> system<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.480> can<00:00:26.750> you

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
trains with the MTH system and can you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.779 
trains with the MTH system and can you
control<00:00:27.200> MTH<00:00:27.710> trains<00:00:28.070> with<00:00:28.280> the<00:00:28.400> Lionel

control MTH trains with the Lionel

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.550 
control MTH trains with the Lionel
system<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:29.840> I'm<00:00:29.930> going<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:30.140> try<00:00:30.289> to<00:00:30.320> answer

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
system and so I'm going to try to answer

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.049 
system and so I'm going to try to answer
some<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:30.950> those<00:00:31.100> questions<00:00:31.160> today<00:00:31.850> and

hopefully clear up some of the confusion
about<00:00:34.129> these<00:00:34.399> two<00:00:34.550> systems<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:35.630> they're

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
about these two systems and what they're

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.440

command base here and the cab one remote
that<00:01:12.499> goes<00:01:12.649> with<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:12.950> you'll<00:01:13.579> notice<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:13.969> don't

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
that goes with it you'll notice I don't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.879 
that goes with it you'll notice I don't
have<00:01:14.179> a<00:01:14.329> cab<00:01:14.600> one<00:01:14.869> remote<00:01:15.139> and<00:01:15.350> I'll<00:01:15.530> explain

why in a minute but if you've got this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.230 
why in a minute but if you've got this
system<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.740> can<00:01:18.770> have<00:01:19.100> full<00:01:19.369> control<00:01:19.759> over

now<00:02:17.250> let's<00:02:17.459> talk<00:02:17.610> about<00:02:17.670> em<00:02:18.060> GHS<00:02:18.600> system<00:02:19.069> their

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
now let's talk about em GHS system their

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.040 
now let's talk about em GHS system their
systems<00:02:20.520> called<00:02:20.790> DCs<00:02:21.360> which<00:02:21.690> stands<00:02:21.959> for

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
systems called DCs which stands for

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.320 
systems called DCs which stands for
digital<00:02:22.500> command<00:02:22.740> system<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.370> obviously

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
digital command system and obviously

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420 
digital command system and obviously
it's<00:02:24.630> meant<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> control<00:02:25.260> mth<00:02:25.830> engines<00:02:26.250> that

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
it's meant to control mth engines that

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.740 
it's meant to control mth engines that
are<00:02:26.490> equipped<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:26.940> DCs

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
are equipped with DCs

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.130 
are equipped with DCs
however<00:02:28.440> because<00:02:28.890> Lionel<00:02:29.810> licensed<00:02:30.810> out<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
however because Lionel licensed out the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.460 
however because Lionel licensed out the
TMCC<00:02:31.830> system<00:02:32.750> mth<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:33.930> smart<00:02:34.200> enough<00:02:34.410> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
TMCC system mth was smart enough to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.680 
TMCC system mth was smart enough to
build<00:02:34.800> into<00:02:35.459> their<00:02:35.580> system<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> ability<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
build into their system the ability to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.320 
build into their system the ability to
control<00:02:37.020> TMCC<00:02:37.830> engines<00:02:38.220> however<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.090> can't

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
control TMCC engines however you can't

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.630 
control TMCC engines however you can't
do<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.720> by<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.020> buying<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.739> mth<00:02:41.130> system<00:02:41.489> by

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
do that by just buying the mth system by

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.970 
do that by just buying the mth system by
itself<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.630> still<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.200> buy<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.380> Lionel

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
itself you still have to buy the Lionel

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.340 
itself you still have to buy the Lionel
command<00:02:44.340> base<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.880> then<00:02:45.390> with<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.080> cable

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
command base and then with this cable

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.830 
command base and then with this cable
that's<00:02:47.010> sold<00:02:47.280> separately<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.360> connect<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that's sold separately you connect the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.650 
that's sold separately you connect the
tiu<00:02:49.340> over<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> command<00:02:50.880> base<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.390> then

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
tiu over to the command base and then

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.870 
tiu over to the command base and then
you're<00:02:51.840> able<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.290> send<00:02:52.800> commands<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.459> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
you're able to send commands to the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.259 
you're able to send commands to the
command<00:02:54.269> base<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.350> mth<00:02:55.800> remote<00:02:56.269> because

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
command base with the mth remote because

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.750 
command base with the mth remote because
the<00:02:57.570> mth<00:02:58.080> system<00:02:58.530> will<00:02:58.830> evalute<00:02:59.340> ikan<00:02:59.550> troll

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the mth system will evalute ikan troll

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.809 
the mth system will evalute ikan troll
both<00:02:59.970> mth<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.810> Lionel<00:03:01.470> trains<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.670> have

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
both mth and Lionel trains if you have

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.090 
both mth and Lionel trains if you have
the<00:03:02.970> two<00:03:03.120> systems<00:03:03.480> linked<00:03:03.780> together<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.950> can

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
the two systems linked together you can

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.530 
the two systems linked together you can
save<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.340> little<00:03:05.519> money<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.850> not<00:03:06.060> have<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.420> buy

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
save a little money and not have to buy

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.199 
save a little money and not have to buy
the<00:03:06.600> cab<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.200> remote<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.790> remember<00:03:09.180> that

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
the cab one remote and you remember that

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.150 
the cab one remote and you remember that
I<00:03:09.330> said<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.630> don't<00:03:09.750> own<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> cab<00:03:10.410> one<00:03:10.680> remote<00:03:10.980> well

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
I said I don't own a cab one remote well

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.890 
I said I don't own a cab one remote well
that's<00:03:11.370> why<00:03:11.580> because<00:03:11.880> I've<00:03:12.239> got<00:03:12.540> these<00:03:12.660> two

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
that's why because I've got these two

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.570 
that's why because I've got these two
linked<00:03:13.110> together<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.709> then<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.980> control<00:03:14.370> both

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
linked together and then I control both

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.180 
linked together and then I control both
line<00:03:14.850> L<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.090> mth<00:03:15.780> trains<00:03:16.110> with<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:16.980> one

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
line L and mth trains with this one

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.910 
line L and mth trains with this one
single<00:03:17.550> remote<00:03:18.260> so<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.380> answer<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.799> question

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
single remote so the answer the question

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.910 
single remote so the answer the question
of<00:03:20.400> whether<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.209> control<00:03:21.840> TMCC<00:03:22.620> trains

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
of whether you can control TMCC trains

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.090 
of whether you can control TMCC trains
with<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.220> mth<00:03:23.880> system<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.420> yes<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.620> fact<00:03:25.650> I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
with the mth system is yes and in fact I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.770 
with the mth system is yes and in fact I
did<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.280> video<00:03:26.489> where<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.000> showed<00:03:27.329> how<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.570> do

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
did a video where I showed how to do

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.210 
did a video where I showed how to do

answer<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.209> yes<00:03:39.450> but<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.930> only<00:03:39.959> have<00:03:40.320> limited

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
answer is yes but you only have limited

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.699 
answer is yes but you only have limited
control<00:03:40.980> because<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.239> hook<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.110> mth

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
control because if you hook the mth

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.370 
control because if you hook the mth
system<00:03:44.130> into<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.579> command<00:03:44.910> base<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.989> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
system into the command base this the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.110 
system into the command base this the
mth<00:03:46.769> system<00:03:47.130> will<00:03:47.250> only<00:03:47.400> allow<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.940> access

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
mth system will only allow you to access

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
mth system will only allow you to access
the<00:03:48.390> classic<00:03:49.140> TMCC<00:03:49.769> features<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.299> you

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
the classic TMCC features and so you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.750 
the classic TMCC features and so you
will<00:03:52.350> be<00:03:52.500> able<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.769> control<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.400> legacy

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
will be able to control the legacy

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.009 
will be able to control the legacy
engine<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.299> will<00:03:54.450> not<00:03:54.600> be<00:03:54.780> able<00:03:54.930> to

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
engine but you will not be able to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
you're new to the hobby and you don't

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.340 
you're new to the hobby and you don't
have<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.579> these<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:09.390> can<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.780> buy<00:04:09.959> this

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
have one of these you can just buy this

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.229 
have one of these you can just buy this
and<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.250> connect<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.970> two<00:04:12.120> together

and this and connect the two together

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.479 
and this and connect the two together
and<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:13.140> might<00:04:13.350> make<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.680> think<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:14.010> well

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
and that might make you think that well

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.550 
and that might make you think that well
if<00:04:15.000> I'm<00:04:15.180> connecting<00:04:15.660> these<00:04:15.840> two<00:04:15.989> together<00:04:16.109> I

if I'm connecting these two together I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.229 
if I'm connecting these two together I
should<00:04:17.070> be<00:04:17.160> able<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.430> access<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.940> legacy

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
should be able to access the legacy

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.060 
should be able to access the legacy
features<00:04:18.570> but<00:04:18.750> that's<00:04:18.900> not<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.140> case<00:04:19.289> because

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070

this<00:04:21.030> system<00:04:21.720> will<00:04:22.049> only<00:04:22.200> access<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.890> classic

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
connect these two together you'll only

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.600 
connect these two together you'll only

if<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.830> have<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.129> money<00:05:29.310> my<00:05:29.520> personal

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
if you have the money my personal

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:31.850 
if you have the money my personal
recommendation<00:05:30.689> would<00:05:30.810> be<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:31.080> buy<00:05:31.229> the<00:05:31.289> mth

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
recommendation would be to buy the mth

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.189 
recommendation would be to buy the mth
system<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.550> then<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.240> legacy<00:05:33.449> system<00:05:34.020> and

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
system and then the legacy system and

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.619 
system and then the legacy system and
with<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.219> combination<00:05:35.819> of<00:05:35.909> these<00:05:36.060> two<00:05:36.300> you'll

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
with the combination of these two you'll

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.869 
with the combination of these two you'll
have<00:05:36.839> complete<00:05:37.319> control<00:05:37.500> over<00:05:37.800> any<00:05:38.310> mth

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
have complete control over any mth

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.899 
have complete control over any mth
engine<00:05:39.300> any<00:05:39.930> TMCC<00:05:40.860> engine<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.400> any<00:05:41.580> legacy

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
engine any TMCC engine and any legacy

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.760 
engine any TMCC engine and any legacy
engine<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.539> because<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.229> have<00:05:43.259> this<00:05:43.560> you'll

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
engine and because you have this you'll

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.469 
engine and because you have this you'll
be<00:05:43.889> able<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.129> take<00:05:44.279> advantage<00:05:44.909> of<00:05:45.060> all<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.210> the

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
be able to take advantage of all of the

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.990 
be able to take advantage of all of the
legacy<00:05:45.930> features<00:05:46.289> if<00:05:46.639> you're<00:05:47.639> on<00:05:47.729> a<00:05:47.759> budget

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
legacy features if you're on a budget

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.119 
legacy features if you're on a budget
and<00:05:48.210> looking<00:05:48.599> to<00:05:48.690> cut<00:05:48.900> cost<00:05:49.139> a<00:05:49.319> little<00:05:49.409> bit<00:05:49.560> you

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
and looking to cut cost a little bit you

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.040 
and looking to cut cost a little bit you
could<00:05:50.279> try<00:05:50.550> getting<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:50.969> mth<00:05:51.419> system<00:05:51.870> and

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
could try getting the mth system and

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.320 
could try getting the mth system and
then<00:05:52.500> getting<00:05:52.680> one<00:05:52.860> of<00:05:52.979> these<00:05:53.099> classic<00:05:53.639> TMCC

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
then getting one of these classic TMCC

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.809 
then getting one of these classic TMCC
command<00:05:54.779> bases<00:05:55.229> since<00:05:55.830> legacy<00:05:56.310> came<00:05:56.520> out<00:05:56.639> you

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
command bases since legacy came out you

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.790 
command bases since legacy came out you
can<00:05:56.969> get<00:05:57.089> these<00:05:57.270> for<00:05:57.479> pretty<00:05:57.690> cheap<00:05:57.960> on<00:05:58.169> eBay

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
can get these for pretty cheap on eBay

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.490 
can get these for pretty cheap on eBay
or<00:05:58.830> any<00:05:59.159> any<00:05:59.550> train<00:05:59.819> store<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.360> with<00:06:01.349> that

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
or any any train store and with that

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.929 
or any any train store and with that
cable<00:06:01.710> I<00:06:01.919> showed<00:06:02.159> you<00:06:02.310> if<00:06:02.430> you<00:06:02.520> connect<00:06:02.849> these

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:02.939 
cable I showed you if you connect these

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:04.879 
cable I showed you if you connect these
two<00:06:03.210> together<00:06:03.330> you'll<00:06:04.199> get<00:06:04.379> the<00:06:04.500> most<00:06:04.650> bang

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
two together you'll get the most bang

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.740 
two together you'll get the most bang
for<00:06:04.919> your<00:06:05.189> buck<00:06:05.400> because<00:06:06.029> you'll<00:06:06.360> be<00:06:06.449> able<00:06:06.569> to

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
for your buck because you'll be able to

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.379 
for your buck because you'll be able to
control<00:06:07.080> any<00:06:07.289> mth<00:06:07.860> engine<00:06:08.250> as<00:06:08.430> well<00:06:08.879> as<00:06:09.089> any

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
TMCC or legacy engine family downside is

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:13.939 
TMCC or legacy engine family downside is
that<00:06:12.539> you<00:06:12.839> won't<00:06:13.020> be<00:06:13.139> able<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.349> access<00:06:13.770> some<00:06:13.919> of

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
that you won't be able to access some of

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.619 
that you won't be able to access some of
the<00:06:14.069> advanced<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.610> legacy<00:06:14.969> features<00:06:15.300> of

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
the advanced the legacy features of

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.839 
the advanced the legacy features of
those<00:06:16.020> legacy<00:06:16.469> engines<00:06:16.860> but<00:06:17.370> then<00:06:17.520> later<00:06:17.759> on

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
those legacy engines but then later on

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.640 
those legacy engines but then later on
if<00:06:18.180> you<00:06:18.210> have<00:06:18.419> some<00:06:18.599> more<00:06:18.719> money<00:06:18.870> you<00:06:19.229> can<00:06:19.409> get

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
if you have some more money you can get

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.320 
if you have some more money you can get
one<00:06:19.800> of<00:06:19.889> these<00:06:20.099> and<00:06:20.370> then<00:06:20.879> you'll<00:06:21.029> have<00:06:21.120> access

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
one of these and then you'll have access

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.899 
one of these and then you'll have access
to<00:06:21.689> all<00:06:21.810> those<00:06:21.930> legacy<00:06:22.319> features<00:06:22.650> too<00:06:22.830> so<00:06:23.550> I

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
to all those legacy features too so I

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.550 
to all those legacy features too so I
hope<00:06:24.089> this<00:06:24.270> video<00:06:24.449> helped<00:06:24.960> answer<00:06:25.379> some

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
hope this video helped answer some

hope this video helped answer some
questions<00:06:26.189> about<00:06:26.310> these<00:06:26.610> systems<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.300> about

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 
questions about these systems and about

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.450 
questions about these systems and about
the<00:06:27.629> interchangeability<00:06:28.289> of<00:06:28.589> them<00:06:28.740> that's

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
the interchangeability of them that's

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.779 
the interchangeability of them that's
about<00:06:29.669> all<00:06:29.849> for<00:06:29.879> now<00:06:30.180> I'll<00:06:30.419> see<00:06:30.569> you<00:06:30.629> later
