00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.950
 new please from me my name is Lukas 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.629
 the other day in this video for you the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.730
 bose companion five ago 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 we want to see what it's all about 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 offer or not 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:20.910
 So let's go at first sight 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.310
 see the box in my opinion 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.439
 Damn good and this statement already 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 Also look easy last time 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 a timeless design but look at us 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.449
 box closer to both of them 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.579
 speakers stand on one 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.890
 metal plate which really shows quality 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.410
 but that's what the pillar is to the satellite 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 Made of plastic just like the housing around 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 the satellite speaker himself the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.710
 But grill is not made of metal 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 what sets an accent again we see 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 on the front side of perfect 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 Milled holes and the bad logo 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.120
 Of course, both satellites are leading 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.280
 cable water together with the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 Control module to the acoustic module 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.020
 So connected to the call 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.149
 there are also stream USB cable 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
 cables are not so nice but the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.830
 will be needed at the tax module 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.290
 or control port we can with a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.780
 For example, you can still get an ipod airport 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.820
 express or other connect to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.619
 from them to receive the audio and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.210
 Another headphone input where we 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.930
 headphones could connect who would have 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.240
 that thought 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.960
 since then, this is so beware 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.580
 designed 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.770
 on the bottom this is still 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.299
 non-slip gum on top of where that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.000
 bad logo is still have a little one 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.939
 touch surface where we have the plant 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.220
 and can turn off and led shows 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.500
 then the status of the investment in money 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 means that the sound is out green that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.610
 the plant is active and threatens that she 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.530
 in the standby he is what he really is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.130
 main task is the volume too 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.020
 regulate 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.149
 and that goes to the beautiful rubberized 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.829
 ring outside a thing that also 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.110
 it is a pity that you are not 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.090
 See how loud the plant is right there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.009
 you do not have an indicator or something in that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.899
 art and that you do not have the bass 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.259
 govern directly from this control rage 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.170
 can 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.299
 but well enough to the checkpoint next 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520
 to the subwoofer this will be a big one 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.649
 language also called acoustic max module 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.810
 as one already said in unboxing 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.789
 this bit lengthy but what 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.619
 it does not matter his job is there 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.520
 Something fits a whole story 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.340
 bring and also created a 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.230
 it was for the entire system in front 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.420
 we have metal around the housing again 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.550
 seems to be made of wood 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.890
 on the back have already told me 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.930
 all the connections and one more 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.210
 bass regulator in this we can do the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.710
 set the system to a normal value or 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.540
 but increase the bass content 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.490
 he is not good at all 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.300
 but you will reach him later 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.550
 do not need 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.290
 But now we come to the sound one 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.810
 thing that makes the system special 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.570
 that they have a 5.1 sound only with two 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.950
 loud speakers i say imitates where it is 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.680
 recommends a distance between 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.080
 the satellites are significantly larger than 1 60 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.610
 cm is the facility is not there for one 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.590
 to order space but wants as 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.050
 multimedia system can be seen 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.790
 then she travels in my opinion to get out 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.040
 a small room to sound or 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.650
 even a small hifi system to replace 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.050
 in the league of three to four euros mini 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.370
 HiFi systems can run the systems on each one 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.040
 fall in the front or 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.110
 even surpasses this but it is 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.690
 actually designed for 5.1 listed 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.850
 movies music and games open point 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.340
 One, what does that mean at all ? 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.290
 actually have a 2.1 system here 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.350
 means two speakers and one 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.510
 Subwoofers in a 5.1 system we have 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.730
 a total of five speakers around one 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.890
 are placed around so left right 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.630
 and the middle speakers are these 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.550
 the main speakers and then have 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.590
 we still left and right behind us 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.780
 this sound speaker and ultimately 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.940
 another point 1 subwoofer 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.740
 All this makes this system only 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.580
 with two speakers and that works 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.560
 really good too 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.220
 I will try you with an example 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.220
 to show that 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.400
 Sure the hff leaks might be 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.260
 in halls are located 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.270
 but I think Bose has this facility 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.370
 just not designed for a special 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.410
 Linear sound as seen from studio 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.380
 monitors knows to deliver but 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.070
 just a cool 5.1 experience too 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.780
 to generate 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.760
 the bose says itself forms the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.980
 a surprisingly realistic system 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.380
 5.1 sound reproduction in my opinion 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.090
 after very flawless sounds but that can 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.830
 You can also expect the speakers 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.990
 by brose for circa missing euro 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.060
 are now tendered 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.460
 this one from online for under 30 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.260
 euro for about 290 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.330
 In conclusion, it can be said that one 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.250
 Here is a really from the leyen very 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.110
 awesome facility with a possibilities 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.150
 Sound gets this has already lifted 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.320
 kinofeeling but comes only with two 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.240
 loudspeakers 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.580
 That's exactly what this system does 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.590
 especially yes I hope you have this 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.270
 Video if that is we can 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.040
 Show more by giving this video a 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.050
 green thumb gives because I then let 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.950
 it will remain until then subscribe 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.950
 comment and ciao
