00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 hello friends with you in weights and today I 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.450
 I would like to show you what is heard on 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 front android lollipop for one plus one 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.750
 of a heard that began to roll out 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.320
 first builds are dealing with this 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.699
 build 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.019
 1 builds android 50 it is based on 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 open source android by and large 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.890
 this is done on the basis of events but Sanji and 12 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.579
 djen fashion scene of them literally nothing 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.570
 This is a naked android without any chips 5 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.590
 any buns 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.969
 without any additions 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.890
 That is the same Andrew himself who can 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.579
 meet for example on nexus 5 wines on 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.649
 ti6 further what to work here what is here 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.989
 does not work first in this build 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.120
 corrected all the rough bogey that is 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.219
 all communications work 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.680
 wifi works bluetooth works and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.300
 nexia tested on battery runs in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.510
 Generally fine that is not to some 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.549
 scary zhora works gps works 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.119
 strangely I will immediately say that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.159
 maps it determines the location 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.799
 but for some reason it shows the opposite 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.509
 have before ordering before somehow weird 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.430
 by and large 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.220
 this build is already available 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.020
 free enough everything that didn't run 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 most applications run on 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.710
 fine all chips android 50 in general 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.509
 all settings work here 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.970
 how would anything have this all animation 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 everything works quite smoothly on site 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.650
 but then there it can fly 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.079
 some small slow down what's in 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.810
 overall does not affect the operation of the system itself 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.540
 if there is not found it in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.090
 security 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.950
 what is missing is a face that is forehead 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 there is on nexus 6p nexus 5 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.680
 but in general it's not scary and in general on 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.040
 work is not affected 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.770
 from minor bugs that I noticed that 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.470
 present here firstly if i 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.950
 I am in mode 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.110
 then instead of lg mode instead of for j 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.970
 drawn from above icon 3g therefore 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.990
 how would that cutie 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.080
 confuses but works great speed 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.490
 next cancel me here now 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.150
 the onscreen navigation buttons from the very 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.670
 android 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.890
 The default here only work as 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.260
 navigation buttons of the device itself 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.000
 not on-screen buttons to 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.709
 earned the navigation button itself 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.350
 android need to do a few 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.720
 a combination of which I will write in the description to 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.459
 this video and by and large except 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.020
 these ones 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.070
 bak nothing bad i'm not 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.390
 noticed of course everything works not perfect 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:50.090
 here and there , something can slow down 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.480
 to here it is there something may hang 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.239
 or fly but I repeat already 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.850
 Today, this build can 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.650
 quite normal to use in any 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 case 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.450
 get acquainted with what is android 50 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.620
 you can definitely one hundred percent can i 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.470
 advise this firmware for 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.989
 everyday use in general if 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.459
 you understand yourself 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.530
 you can install it yourself 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.620
 and deal with problems that may 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.870
 be that so I can advise 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.570
 if you're going to leave someone 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.610
 friend girlfriend and some acquaintances 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.739
 that nothing in this do not understand 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.100
 of course this is not for them this build 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.800
 experimental enough 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:38.020
 I personally do not like this build 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.420
 I do not like the fact that this is not the price of gin 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.000
 mod I 'm sick I'm used to all the buns 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.220
 to all custom firmware tokens 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.680
 for example, what am I missing here and what 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.830
 In general, I expect from android 50 or a 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.320
 cyanogenmod 12 example if i hear 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.470
 I love music uses such a chip 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.610
 when the phone in my pocket by 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.100
 pressing the volume button I love 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.100
 switch tracks for a long hold these 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.000
 but here it is for example not 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.490
 tantamount to and not possible 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.530
 change the navigation buttons in places i 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.540
 used to use the back button here on 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.450
 this here instead of the last 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.830
 Iâ€™m not comfortable with running applications 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.640
 ability to change the number of buttons 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.830
 with its five home buttons that is here 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.830
 Here, here on the custom, there are usually several 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.740
 buttons and it really helps in the work 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.240
 except for this probably in fast 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.000
 settings I would like the opportunity 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.340
 change these quick settings but one of 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.160
 the most such necessary opportunities 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.860
 which is missing in android 50 on my 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.350
 a look is what's like when you click on 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.060
 the last running application is not 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.280
 grabs the delete all button 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.610
 because look i have here 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.330
 not probably anything that ran 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.970
 and delve between here between this all 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.230
 questions unreal well somehow in general and 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.210
 here from every time close 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.200
 just k in my opinion does not appear 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.980
 possible with all this here 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.690
 to aggravate 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.550
 if in previous versions of android with 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.550
 Rebooting the device is all reset to zero 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.140
 then it all remains and I do not even know 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.260
 how big the list can grow to 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.640
 In general, here are the cases . 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.840
 android 50 no one plus one 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.870
 put or not put it up 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.720
 surely you yourself today on this 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.720
 all everything until we meet again
