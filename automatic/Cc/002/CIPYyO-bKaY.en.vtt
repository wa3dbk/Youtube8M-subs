00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
shaving and you can do waxing I wouldn't

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.119 
shaving and you can do waxing I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:45.270> taking<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> Nair<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.860> doing

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
recommend taking like the Nair and doing

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
recommend taking like the Nair and doing
that<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:48.090> feel<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.690> would

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that just because I feel like that would

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690 
that just because I feel like that would
burn<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.520> that's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
burn and I just don't think that that's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600 
burn and I just don't think that that's
the<00:00:50.969> smartest<00:00:51.300> idea<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.960> at<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.309> first

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the smartest idea to do at all so first

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
the smartest idea to do at all so first
I<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.260> waxing<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.500> there's<00:00:55.680> two

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I will do waxing so there's two

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
I will do waxing so there's two
different<00:00:55.980> types<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.399> waxes<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.300> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
different types of waxes that I know of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.910 
different types of waxes that I know of
personally<00:00:57.840> there<00:00:58.170> might<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.530> out<00:00:58.590> there

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
personally there might be more out there

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
personally there might be more out there
but<00:00:59.070> there's<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.730> bikini<00:01:00.120> wax<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
but there's the bikini wax and the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.770 
but there's the bikini wax and the
Brazilian<00:01:01.140> wax<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> bikini<00:01:02.039> wax<00:01:02.280> is

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
Brazilian wax so the bikini wax is

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.590 
Brazilian wax so the bikini wax is
basically<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:05.309> hair<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.820> trimmed<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
basically it's your hair is trimmed and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.469 
basically it's your hair is trimmed and
part<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.530> waxed<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.189> where<00:01:08.850> your

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
part of it is waxed off where your

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.789 
part of it is waxed off where your
bikini<00:01:09.840> would<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.290> there's<00:01:10.439> about<00:01:10.590> an

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
bikini would be and there's about an

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
bikini would be and there's about an
extra<00:01:11.100> inch<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.030> hair<00:01:12.299> will<00:01:12.479> pop

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
extra inch there so now hair will pop

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
extra inch there so now hair will pop
out<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.170> bikini<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:13.680> i<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
out of your bikini which i think is a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
out of your bikini which i think is a
good<00:01:14.640> idea<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.360> kind<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
good idea because it's kind of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.880 
good idea because it's kind of
embarrassing<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> pool<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> then

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
embarrassing to go to a pool and then

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
embarrassing to go to a pool and then
you<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.939> hairs<00:01:18.210> coming<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:18.960> out

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you have like your hairs coming up out

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.710 
you have like your hairs coming up out
of<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.470> suit<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:21.000> mean<00:01:21.180> it's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
of your suit you know and I mean it's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
of your suit you know and I mean it's
it's<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.380> easy<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> conceal<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.520> kind

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it's kind of easy to conceal it but kind

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.830 
it's kind of easy to conceal it but kind
of<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.360> you're<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> pool

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of not because when you're in the pool

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.899 
of not because when you're in the pool
you<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.200> move<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.340> things<00:01:26.700> can

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you do move around and so things can
