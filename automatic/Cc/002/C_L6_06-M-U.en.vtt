I don't remember or maybe I made the
video<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.080> didn't<00:00:22.350> upload<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.010> am

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
which is a year before this one is kind

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
which is a year before this one is kind
of<00:00:39.300> somewhat<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.350> collector's<00:00:40.950> grail<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
of somewhat of a collector's grail of

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.410 
of somewhat of a collector's grail of
Emerson<00:00:43.140> guys<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> first<00:00:44.969> year<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Emerson guys that was a first year of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.700 
Emerson guys that was a first year of
the<00:00:46.670> commander<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.820> mr.<00:00:48.570> Emerson<00:00:49.050> did<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the commander and mr. Emerson did the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.299 
the commander and mr. Emerson did the
work<00:00:49.950> himself<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.760> he<00:00:51.329> built<00:00:51.600> those<00:00:51.870> knives

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
work himself so he built those knives

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.180 
work himself so he built those knives
himself<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.120> custom

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
himself so it's kind of a custom

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.670 
himself so it's kind of a custom
production<00:00:56.190> type<00:00:56.910> deal<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.510> haven't<00:00:58.410> been<00:00:58.500> able

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
production type deal I haven't been able

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.110 
production type deal I haven't been able
to<00:00:59.010> secure<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> 98<00:01:00.239> commander<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.219> 99<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
to secure a 98 commander so this 99 is

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
to secure a 98 commander so this 99 is
going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.809> close<00:01:04.199> enough<00:01:04.409> i<00:01:04.769> guess

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
going to have to be close enough i guess

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.600 
going to have to be close enough i guess
it's<00:01:05.700> very<00:01:06.000> similar<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.840> looks<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:08.280> just

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it's very similar in looks it just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.600 
it's very similar in looks it just
wasn't<00:01:09.299> put<00:01:09.659> together<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.290> mr.<00:01:11.130> Emerson

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
wasn't put together by mr. Emerson

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.719 
wasn't put together by mr. Emerson
himself<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.070> combo<00:01:14.549> edge

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
himself so this is the combo edge

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
himself so this is the combo edge
version<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.750> been<00:01:15.930> sharpened

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
version you can see it's been sharpened

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
version you can see it's been sharpened
quite<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> years<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:18.150> sure<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
quite a bit over the years I'm sure this

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
quite a bit over the years I'm sure this
knife<00:01:18.960> has<00:01:19.250> had<00:01:20.250> some<00:01:20.909> stories<00:01:21.450> behind<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
knife has had some stories behind it the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
knife has had some stories behind it the
construction<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.450> different<00:01:24.780> than

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
construction is a little different than

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.249 
construction is a little different than
your<00:01:25.049> modern<00:01:25.549> commander<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.750> scales

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
your modern commander in that the scales

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.370 
your modern commander in that the scales
are<00:01:28.740> held<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:30.000> sorry<00:01:30.210> yeah<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> scales

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
are held on to I'm sorry yeah the scales

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.999 
are held on to I'm sorry yeah the scales
are<00:01:31.619> held<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> liner's<00:01:34.009> separately

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
are held on to the liner's separately

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.249 
are held on to the liner's separately
then<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> rest<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.390> knife<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.110> have

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
then the rest of the knife so you have

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.490 
then the rest of the knife so you have
these<00:01:37.409> three<00:01:37.710> screws<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.610> hold<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
these three screws here that hold the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
these three screws here that hold the
scale<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.579> liners<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
scale on to the liners and then if you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
scale on to the liners and then if you
were<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> remove<00:01:43.470> these<00:01:43.710> scales<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.490> would

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
were to remove these scales you would

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.719 
were to remove these scales you would
see<00:01:44.790> screws<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.960> through<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.979> back<00:01:47.189> spacer

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
see screws going through the back spacer

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.510 
see screws going through the back spacer
holding<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.780> liner's<00:01:49.229> together<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
holding the liner's together so it's a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.719 
holding the liner's together so it's a
lot<00:01:50.729> closer<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.659> how<00:01:52.460> customs<00:01:53.460> are

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
lot closer to how customs are

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.859 
lot closer to how customs are
constructed<00:01:54.450> compared<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:56.600> his<00:01:57.600> knives

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
constructed compared to how his knives

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.350 
constructed compared to how his knives
are<00:01:58.110> constructed<00:01:58.619> now<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.159> were<00:01:59.700> constructed

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
are constructed now and were constructed

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
are constructed now and were constructed
after<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.390> liner<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
after this you can see the liner is the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.340 
after this you can see the liner is the
thinner<00:02:05.659> variety<00:02:06.659> than<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.259> would

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
thinner variety than what you would

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.309 
thinner variety than what you would
typically<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:09.450> still<00:02:09.869> has<00:02:10.080> good

lock<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.800> although<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> believe<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.970> at<00:02:12.120> some

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
lock up although I believe that at some

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.800 
lock up although I believe that at some
point

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
point

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.400 
point
was<00:02:13.020> sent<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:14.160> worked<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:16.020> because

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
was sent in to be worked on just because

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.809 
was sent in to be worked on just because
of<00:02:16.650> some<00:02:18.349> interesting<00:02:19.349> things<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:20.069> it

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
of some interesting things going on it

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.710 
of some interesting things going on it
does<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.709> safe<00:02:23.280> detent<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:24.510> side

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
does have the safe detent on this side

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.670 
does have the safe detent on this side
which<00:02:24.959> i<00:02:25.110> don't<00:02:25.170> think<00:02:25.739> was<00:02:26.670> being<00:02:26.940> used<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.680> 99

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
which i don't think was being used in 99

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.449 
which i don't think was being used in 99
and<00:02:28.980> then<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:30.239> original<00:02:30.840> detent<00:02:31.349> hole<00:02:31.739> on<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and then the original detent hole on the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.710 
and then the original detent hole on the
blade<00:02:32.730> doesn't<00:02:33.060> quite<00:02:33.300> match<00:02:33.569> up<00:02:33.630> with<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
blade doesn't quite match up with the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.059 
blade doesn't quite match up with the
detent<00:02:36.720> hole<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.110> liner<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.680> think<00:02:37.769> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
detent hole in the liner so I think the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.949 
detent hole in the liner so I think the
liners<00:02:38.459> had<00:02:38.640> been<00:02:38.790> replaced<00:02:39.239> at<00:02:39.480> some<00:02:39.690> point

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
liners had been replaced at some point

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.380 
liners had been replaced at some point
with<00:02:40.200> newer<00:02:40.470> liners<00:02:41.090> although<00:02:42.090> I'm<00:02:42.209> not<00:02:42.269> a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
with newer liners although I'm not a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.170 
with newer liners although I'm not a
hundred<00:02:42.569> percent<00:02:42.750> sure<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.580> also<00:02:44.790> think

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
hundred percent sure and I also think

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.180 
hundred percent sure and I also think
the<00:02:45.480> hardware<00:02:45.959> has<00:02:46.080> been<00:02:46.260> changed<00:02:46.819> because<00:02:47.819> I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the hardware has been changed because I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
the hardware has been changed because I
believe<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.489> should<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.910> had<00:02:51.180> flat<00:02:51.930> head

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
believe this should have had flat head

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.289 
believe this should have had flat head
screws<00:02:52.590> instead<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.190> Philips<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.030> could<00:02:54.269> be

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
screws instead of Philips but I could be

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.330 
screws instead of Philips but I could be
wrong<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.870> they<00:02:55.590> definitely<00:02:55.739> shouldn't<00:02:56.220> have

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
wrong and they definitely shouldn't have

wrong and they definitely shouldn't have
been<00:02:56.459> polished<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.090> looks<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.420> somebody

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
been polished it looks like somebody

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.930 
been polished it looks like somebody
possibly<00:02:58.260> polished<00:02:58.709> them<00:02:58.830> maybe<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.910> just

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
possibly polished them maybe it just

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.699 
possibly polished them maybe it just
wore<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.569> way<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.200> could<00:03:01.440> be<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.890> these

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
wore that way that could be that these

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.620 
wore that way that could be that these
screws<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:05.099> just<00:03:05.580> more<00:03:05.849> in<00:03:06.150> somebody's

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
screws just just more in somebody's

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.210 
screws just just more in somebody's
pocket<00:03:06.660> which<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.380> pretty<00:03:07.530> cool<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.970> that's<00:03:09.120> my

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
pocket which is pretty cool so that's my

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.530 
pocket which is pretty cool so that's my
99<00:03:11.220> commander<00:03:11.910> right<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.450> next<00:03:13.260> up<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.680> my

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
99 commander right here next up is my

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.960 
99 commander right here next up is my
2000<00:03:15.540> commander<00:03:16.260> similar<00:03:17.190> construction<00:03:17.820> with

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
2000 commander similar construction with

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.569 
2000 commander similar construction with
the<00:03:18.090> scales<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:19.320> one<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.709> basically<00:03:20.220> new<00:03:20.400> in

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
the scales this one is basically new in

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.050 
the scales this one is basically new in
box<00:03:20.820> though<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.720> has<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.440> original<00:03:23.130> satin

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
box though it has the original satin

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.300 
box though it has the original satin
finish<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.109> I<00:03:25.560> believe<00:03:26.100> it's<00:03:26.250> a

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
finish so it's like a I believe it's a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.150 
finish so it's like a I believe it's a
chrome<00:03:26.760> finish<00:03:27.390> on<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.840> blade<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.859> can<00:03:28.980> see

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
chrome finish on the blade you can see

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.430 
chrome finish on the blade you can see
right<00:03:29.190> there<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.420> actually<00:03:30.959> offered

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
right there it's not actually offered

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.650 
right there it's not actually offered
anymore<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.730> part<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> reason<00:03:33.450> why<00:03:33.480> I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
anymore it's part of the reason why I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.880 
anymore it's part of the reason why I
picked<00:03:34.319> this<00:03:34.470> one<00:03:34.739> up<00:03:34.799> just<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:36.890> don't

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
picked this one up just because I don't

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.420 
picked this one up just because I don't
have<00:03:38.220> any<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:39.989> finish<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.130> ought<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> be

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
have any with this finish so ought to be

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.750 
have any with this finish so ought to be
a<00:03:41.579> thought<00:03:41.819> it'd<00:03:41.940> be<00:03:41.970> cool<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:43.760> see

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
a thought it'd be cool to have it see

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.819 
a thought it'd be cool to have it see
the<00:03:45.000> scales<00:03:45.660> their<00:03:47.239> original<00:03:48.239> liner<00:03:48.510> thin<00:03:49.290> on

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
the scales their original liner thin on

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.670 
the scales their original liner thin on
this<00:03:50.340> one<00:03:52.700> same<00:03:53.700> story<00:03:54.060> elsewhere<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:55.530> one

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
this one same story elsewhere it's one

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.400 
this one same story elsewhere it's one
thing<00:03:55.709> that's<00:03:55.980> really<00:03:56.100> cool<00:03:56.220> about<00:03:56.430> Emerson's

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
thing that's really cool about Emerson's

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.140 
thing that's really cool about Emerson's
because<00:03:58.410> he<00:03:58.530> has<00:03:58.760> models<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.030> been

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
because he has models that have been

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.270 
because he has models that have been
around<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.660> long<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:01.560> cool<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.040> kind<00:04:02.220> of

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
around so long it's cool to kind of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.190 
around so long it's cool to kind of
collect<00:04:02.519> these<00:04:02.940> little<00:04:03.269> changes<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.989> have

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
collect these little changes that have

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.530 
collect these little changes that have
happened<00:04:04.230> over<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.769> years<00:04:05.239> with<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.420> model

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
happened over the years with the model

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.030 
happened over the years with the model
so<00:04:09.540> really<00:04:09.750> cool<00:04:10.049> i<00:04:10.079> like<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.560> knife<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> lot

so really cool i like this knife a lot
that's<00:04:11.310> pretty<00:04:11.519> cool<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.060> then<00:04:12.329> my<00:04:12.420> latest
