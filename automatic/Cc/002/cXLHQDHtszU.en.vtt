 practical tool and knowledge without 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.070
 However, they have been relegated by 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.530
 new technologies why today

 about the work and experience of 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.890
 hairdresser manuel montesinos who is 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.530
 originating from the disorder of sure and moon 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.170
 oaxaca commented that for 30 years 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.540
 practice the job of a hairdresser and that the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.940
 Mr. Jesus Estrada, native of that same 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.710
 community was your teacher my mom told me 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.500
 he says you're going to get into a trade because 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.180
 one wants a people that is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 irresponsible that does not have work as 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.430
 you will keep 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.760
 for your family to get ahead and it's like 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.790
 I focused on learning with the Lord 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.130
 jesus estrada in that time I started 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.550
 down to the top I started with some 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.910
 scissors and my little machine and 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.800
 and this a wooden armchair at that time 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.990
 I'll start with scissors instep nothing 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.060
 more because my water pistol having 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.580
 more with rosary than my water and milk 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.880
 biggest customer 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.830
 but it resulted in a wooden chair 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.300
 that's how I started 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.980
 well practically a wooden chair 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.950
 Then came the time of his mom mom 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.570
 I'm buying a site and it was they say 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.070
 tehuacán armchair with the narrow lord 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.159
 with was my teacher 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.039
 a new wooden and then he spent the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.050
 time but I was ashamed they came 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.860
 the clients and chased it was already 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.090
 disrupting and I told them then I already 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 I was already winning better and I went to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.150
 United States and I will be in time 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.550
 because the economy was hard and if 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.690
 I had front but my children were 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.840
 little ones that I went ahead 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.840
 and what he earned here could not get us out 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:44.260
 that's what my wife came from 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.360
 purchase of metal for metal because the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.050
 wooden armchair I will not be 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.250
 disarmed gave it and I'm going to sell it with the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.780
 old wood varying to 0 and it's like the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.580
 morning I bought that mirror was a 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.530
 little box that I had now as a mirror 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.780
 of the little ones with these cut of 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.180
 Opel said in this regard has 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.280
 taught his knowledge to young people who 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.820
 for personal reasons they have stopped 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.590
 I went to two young people for a while but 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.140
 they left for the united states had 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.050
 One year with me studying now in the USA 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.230
 they cut the hair only very strong is 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.140
 here an office because I do not dedicate myself to 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.900
 another thing just to any court of 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.720
 hair and each craft represents a part 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.970
 important of the social structure but 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.850
 more for whoever does it since this 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.950
 represents the family livelihood there 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.960
 an office that gives pleasure to the palate of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.450
 guys and big we talk about the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.970
 baker who performs delicious and 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.140
 varied pieces let's see and listen to the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.790
 work of the companion jose lopez arab 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.459
 flour butter yeast egg yolks 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:58.000
 salt sugar are elements that can not 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.600
 Missing for the preparation of delicious 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.450
 varieties of breads like breads shells 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.450
 Nochales chicharrón champéry nash 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.490
 volcanoes and scolded these are just 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.070
 some bread names that have been 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.950
 preserved thanks to the effort that since 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.850
 more than 40 years ago don julio reyes 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.040
 martínez puts him to his trade as a baker 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.830
 don julio is from tezoatlan de 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.800
 safe and moon oaxaca learned this 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.500
 job starting as assistant to the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.630
 Lord Theodore Celis Peace currently 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.000
 continues to preserve the process of 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.430
 baked with firewood which makes the 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.280
 difference because it gives a better flavor 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.470
 to the product contrary to what happens to 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.830
 baking with gas depends on the wood 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.710
 well this version to the method all the 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.400
 night I know that the lottery is already 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:55.750
 dry already ready to burn the time that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.729
 it is burning as much as a 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.830
 hour and half 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:06.520
 it is not difficult the thing since it does not 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:10.870
 put effort then as interested in 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.439
 learn then if in a year do not make bread 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.439
 Well, that's why I sell this nothing 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:22.980
 here in the house did not deliver any 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:26.740
 time grace people consume it here 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.930
 there will not be before and if I delivered 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.260
 several stores not 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.810
 But right now, because of my age, 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.310
 I can not stand it anymore because we can not stand it because 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.890
 I want to say no because the lady also 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.310
 work here with me and not before 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:48.460
 because she goes out to distribute the bread 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:52.330
 it's about parties so sometimes I 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:58.090
 ask in wemble 500 pieces 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:06:01.990
 300 will see if it starts is that the 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:06.940
 increase then not everything 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:10.060
 and competition nothing else that is not there 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.550
 I can tell who is because they are 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.740
 several and here 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.560
 only to the taste of the people not with 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.900
 July has had several apprentices the 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.450
 problem is that some have left without 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.730
 learn completely because nothing more than 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:29.230
 input per output because it comes to me 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:32.440
 talk and I tell them to see if you like it 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.000
 23 months later he can not stand it if he 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.050
 go 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.770
 and some who think they've already learned 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:45.910
 to his house and then he asks to undertake his 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:49.390
 work but does not take effect 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.480
 because when they learned well when 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.730
 have a craving for a bread 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.940
 remember the authentic one is the one that 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:00.610
 Bakes with firewood will also help 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.700
 July continue to preserve this traditional 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.510
 office this was another mission of his 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300
 Program 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.650
 the old offices of my people 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.600

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.810
