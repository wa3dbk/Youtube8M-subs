00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
different things that I've done so this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.800 
different things that I've done so this
one<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.909> reason<00:01:05.180> why<00:01:05.269> I<00:01:05.299> picked<00:01:05.539> it<00:01:05.689> is

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
one the reason why I picked it is

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.059 
one the reason why I picked it is
because<00:01:06.079> it<00:01:06.110> has<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.770> D<00:01:07.069> on<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:08.740> hopefully<00:01:09.740> my

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:10.069 
because it has the D on it hopefully my

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.039 
because it has the D on it hopefully my
camera<00:01:10.490> will<00:01:10.670> adjust<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:11.359> that<00:01:11.389> you<00:01:11.659> can<00:01:11.840> see

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
camera will adjust so that you can see

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.899 
camera will adjust so that you can see
it<00:01:12.229> but<00:01:12.740> that's<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.130> reason<00:01:13.490> why<00:01:13.579> I<00:01:13.639> picked

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
it but that's the reason why I picked

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.999 
it but that's the reason why I picked
this<00:01:14.060> style<00:01:14.509> they<00:01:14.779> have<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.439> many<00:01:15.499> on<00:01:15.889> the

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
this style they have so many on the

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.300 
this style they have so many on the
website<00:01:16.459> it<00:01:17.450> was<00:01:17.600> kind<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:17.959> hard<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.679> choose

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
website it was kind of hard to choose

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.859 
website it was kind of hard to choose
which<00:01:19.549> one<00:01:19.759> I<00:01:19.789> want<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.240> but<00:01:20.389> I<00:01:20.420> just<00:01:20.689> thought

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
which one I want it but I just thought

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.050 
which one I want it but I just thought
this<00:01:21.139> one<00:01:21.380> was<00:01:21.499> really<00:01:21.709> really<00:01:21.979> nice<00:01:22.249> because

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
this one was really really nice because

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.419 
this one was really really nice because
I<00:01:23.599> wanted<00:01:23.899> something<00:01:24.319> that<00:01:24.349> was<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.619> little<00:01:24.770> bit

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
I wanted something that was a little bit
