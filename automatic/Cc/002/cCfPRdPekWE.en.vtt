00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello such friends today I will 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.870
 give them a little tutorial of some of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 how we will make the root the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 superuser to our galaxy ds4 the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.230
 Mexican version of third party since it is 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.060
 difficult to get it is usually something 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.699
 sad for the international version 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 but today I'm going to teach you a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.500
 little and then I'm going to teach them 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.240
 what is the version I have 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.940
 this is the newest version that comes out 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.770
 was launched in 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.470
 at the end of June or the beginning of July 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:42.130
 Of 2014 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.130
 we see that the android version is the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.020
 4.4 points 2 skeet cat here we are going to 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.320
 to verify 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.270
 alright we go android 4.4 with all to 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.720
 next the next step we're going 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.720
 to do 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.870
 is to activate them 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.140
 the developer options for this 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.620
 let's give it 78 times to the number of 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.240
 compilation 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.960
 and the menu will appear 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.940
 Developer will give you click let 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.940
 to activate the option that says debugging 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.650
 once this is done we can turn off the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.650
 terminal 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.640
 very well once the terminal is turned off 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.250
 let's enter the done gradin mode of the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.659
 the device that we are going to be 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.530
 pressing the volume key down 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.530
 and the power 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.130
 for a few seconds the vibration will 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.310
 phone and this message will come out 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.560
 I'm going to say that it can cause us 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.270
 problems let's give the volume towards 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.210
 up to continue 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.090
 and we will leave this little android 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.280
 and this device and we're going to leave it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.770
 now what we are going to do 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 let's leave aside and let's 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.020
 download the file that I will leave in 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.850
 the description 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.170
 I have not downloaded 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.170
 we are going to decompress them 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.660
 [Music] 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.050
 and well we will leave this series of 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.599
 files in which we will have the md5 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.670
 file that is what we're going to give us the 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:49.530
 root and login 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.020
 on this occasion 3307 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.390
 very well then let's connect 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.440
 our device to the computer to 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.440
 through its usb cable 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.400
 but let's open odin first let's go 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.400
 to give him run as administrator 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.499
 now then let's connect the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.889
 device to the computer for this 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:16.049
 They should have installed the 10-3 for 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.310
 give us the device drivers 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.989
 we have no problem 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.900
 and we saw how he recognized us 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.760
 Immediately the port where 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.760
 find the man's phone 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.110
 now below is not very simple 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.250
 we will only give 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.290
 in this option it pastes 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.500
 let's select our file that 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.760
 we download that comes in the winrar that 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.920
 downloaded 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.530
 very well now let's start 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.980
 open 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.980
 and here he is going to tell us that he will be 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.180
 checking the file and if everything is very 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.489
 Well are you going to tell us here 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.469
 lips and is now the only thing 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.469
 remains to be done is to start 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.060
 Here we will start making 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:07.799
 process just like in the terminal is going to 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.799
 start loading and it will restart 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.110
 devices are found 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.090
 I'm doing a series of processes 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.440
 in which he tells us he was surrounding 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.000
 installing the application in your port 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.370
 [Music] 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.550
 and it's going to restart only not that 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.449
 we do nothing is not necessary everything 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.499
 it is automated 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.499
 just have to wait 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.310
 start now let's corroborate 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.300
 that is correctly installed 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.680
 for that we are going to look for the application 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.750
 [Music] 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.840
 named of his person 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.710
 [Music] 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.710
 let's open it 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.100
 the cheerful samsung 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.750
 s 4 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.460
 and ready it must be working 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.340
 perfectly 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.930
 now let's corroborate what are we going 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.180
 place thor 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.180
 [Music] 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.860
 and we are going to look 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.770
 [Music] 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.410
 the rut checker 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:23.020
 and verify that the device has been 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:26.129
 correctly rooted 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.129
 let's see install 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.620
 meanwhile on the computer 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.479
 we can close the program 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.650
 of the program has already performed its function 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.440
 correctly 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.729
 we will only wait for this 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.150
 program that is going to give us 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:45.400
 so let's check to see if yes 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.060
 performed correctly we have 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.060
 our 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.220
 let's check root 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.860
 after the request we will not see 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.180
 allow not to leave congratulations this 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.210

 correctly and well this would be all for 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.660
