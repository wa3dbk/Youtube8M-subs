00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.500
 the galera that is the juscelino and in the tutorial 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.139
 or bring you how to transform a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.759
 pen drive a butte 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.539
 Windows 7 installation is very 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.019
 very sought after 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:33.930
 the users of ultrabooks netbooks and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:36.630
 other services there that do not have dvd 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 therefore the formatting of the computer 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.610
 windows installation 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.850
 everything is by means of a hard disk and in the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:57.510
 if teaching how to do with the pen drive 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:01:00.390
 then by command by command 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.629
 who will dictate the galley inter will also 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 need to get into party disco party 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:22.470
 in having the command here it is used for 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.520
 He's going to be for us all the records. 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:34.729
 that are on the computer in my case with 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:37.920
 a pen drive select said 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.180
 in my case as one I'm going to dictate your 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.880
 if it can be another 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.040
 so in my case I'm going to select him 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.640
 And how we gonna need delinquents? 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 give a clime cleaning on when the disc 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.100
 now you will have to create the partition 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:01.770
 as we do in the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 and will now have to activate 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:13.980
 this active partition and now let's 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:18.959
 format 32 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.680
 quick vote and no time has been 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.980
 formatted and quickly 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.640
 if it were that easy 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:36.150
 now let's command here he will do the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:44.010
 that he will give a letter to name the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:49.349
 sound editing partition and a letter is 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.160
 naming people created and now who goes 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.099
 do 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.920
 does not exist because the galley is 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:59.129
 practically close here and now everything 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.390
 What we need is to copy all the 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:11.000
 windows cd files copy all 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:13.500
 the files and put where to play here 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.700
 copy is ready our pendrive 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:24.209
 and it's only you 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.120
 pen drive on some computers that 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.579
 they have the preference 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.579
 it boots in hd 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.329
 the pendrive 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.690
 so there are other tutorials that they will 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.239
 talk about setting up bills for 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.900
 you put the priority 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.359
 the thumb drive to another disk 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.459
 so just finish copying here already 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.250
 but then you will need to do this 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.340
 another setting this I'm going to put 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.419
 a link in the description there of another 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.450
 tutorial 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:03.540
 How will you change the priority of the bill? 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.620
 to run to put the flash drive before 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.209
 of her to put another disc and butane pen 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.730
 drive will run the normal installation of the 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.900
 windows 7 operating system that you 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.109
 copy into the pen drive and that's it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.720
 It's going to be cute for you. 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.849
