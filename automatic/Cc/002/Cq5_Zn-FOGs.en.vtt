00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
like it just kind of

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.650 
like it just kind of
into<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.020> weird<00:02:13.380> glob<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.700> even

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
into this weird glob and it just even

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.780 
into this weird glob and it just even
though<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:15.930> dry<00:02:16.350> at<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.460> day<00:02:17.610> goes

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
though it's dry at just as the day goes

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.670 
though it's dry at just as the day goes
on<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.540> whether<00:02:18.930> you're<00:02:19.170> sweating

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
on like you know whether you're sweating

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.320 
on like you know whether you're sweating
or<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.130> heat<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.910> melting

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
or if the heat is just kind of melting

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.360 
or if the heat is just kind of melting
it<00:02:21.450> I'm<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.660> sure<00:02:21.720> what<00:02:22.110> exactly<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.890> doing

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
it I'm not sure what exactly is doing

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.850 
it I'm not sure what exactly is doing
that<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:24.240> just<00:02:24.450> settles<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.380> makes<00:02:25.650> it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that but it just settles and it makes it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.560 
that but it just settles and it makes it
look<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.820> didn't<00:02:27.090> blend<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.420> out<00:02:27.540> so

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
look like you didn't blend it out so

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.510 
look like you didn't blend it out so
that's<00:02:27.990> why<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.230> don't<00:02:28.560> prefer<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.250> wear<00:02:29.370> these

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520

by<00:02:29.730> themselves<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.360> don't<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.960> they

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
by themselves I don't think that they

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.350 
by themselves I don't think that they
work<00:02:31.680> well<00:02:31.950> enough<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.400> be<00:02:32.490> worn<00:02:32.700> alone<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.210> so

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
work well enough to be worn alone so so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.910 
work well enough to be worn alone so so
now<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.780> gonna<00:02:33.870> quickly<00:02:34.170> swatch<00:02:34.650> the

almost<00:03:01.290> straight<00:03:01.560> up<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.800> water<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.730> other

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
almost straight up like water the other

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
two are a little bit thicker but all in

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.490 
two are a little bit thicker but all in
all<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.640> very<00:03:05.730> thin<00:03:06.180> runny<00:03:06.600> formula<00:03:07.170> and

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
all it is a very thin runny formula and

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.590 
all it is a very thin runny formula and
that's<00:03:08.100> what<00:03:08.370> they<00:03:08.520> all<00:03:08.700> look<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:08.970> streaked

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
that's what they all look like streaked

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.650 
that's what they all look like streaked
applied<00:03:10.110> from<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.560> tube<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.190> no<00:03:11.280> primer<00:03:11.660> but

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
applied from the tube and no primer but

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.450 
applied from the tube and no primer but
the<00:03:12.780> lasting<00:03:13.170> power<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.590> very<00:03:13.830> poor<00:03:14.130> if<00:03:14.340> you

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
the lasting power is very poor if you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.910 
the lasting power is very poor if you
were<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.760> rub<00:03:14.970> these<00:03:15.150> after<00:03:15.750> they<00:03:15.870> dry<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.680> just

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
were to rub these after they dry it just

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.070 
were to rub these after they dry it just
crumbles<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:17.970> goes<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.390> disappears<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
crumbles and it goes it disappears the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.050 
crumbles and it goes it disappears the
pigmentation<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.160> fades<00:03:20.610> away<00:03:20.790> it's

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
pigmentation just like fades away it's

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.240 
pigmentation just like fades away it's
crazy<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.750> lasting<00:03:22.200> power<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.680> really<00:03:22.890> poor

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
crazy the lasting power is really poor

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.520 
crazy the lasting power is really poor
on<00:03:23.490> these<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.000> texture<00:03:24.510> isn't<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.990> best<00:03:25.230> it's

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
on these the texture isn't the best it's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.590 
on these the texture isn't the best it's
just<00:03:25.800> kind<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.220> almost<00:03:26.610> liquidy<00:03:27.360> it's

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
just kind of like almost liquidy it's

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.500 
just kind of like almost liquidy it's
not<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.110> feels<00:03:28.680> very<00:03:28.830> wet<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.270> too

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
not it feels very wet and it's just too

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.810 
not it feels very wet and it's just too
thin<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.140> feel<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.860> layering<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.610> that

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
thin I feel like the layering is that

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.220 
thin I feel like the layering is that
it's<00:03:32.940> hard<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.180> layer<00:03:33.420> these<00:03:33.630> products<00:03:34.080> like

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
it's hard to layer these products like

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.290 
it's hard to layer these products like
if<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.800> want<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.220> build<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.550> up<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.880> look<00:03:36.060> as

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
if you want to build it up to look as

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.390 
if you want to build it up to look as
pigmented<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> tube<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.160> kind

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
pigmented as it is in the tube you kind

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and it just is weird like the texture is

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.440 
and it just is weird like the texture is
so<00:03:43.140> wet<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.770> doesn't<00:03:44.100> want<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.520> apply<00:03:45.390> it
