disappointed with multiplayer

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.759 
disappointed with multiplayer
I<00:00:58.410> think<00:01:00.440> FPS<00:01:01.440> drops<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.219> little<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.769> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
I think FPS drops a little bit and the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.500 
I think FPS drops a little bit and the
maps<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:06.409> small<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.490> used<00:01:09.390> to
