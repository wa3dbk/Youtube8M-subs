space<00:00:12.870> weather<00:00:13.110> calm<00:00:13.590> had<00:00:13.860> constantly<00:00:14.670> lists

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
space weather calm had constantly lists

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.470 
space weather calm had constantly lists
the<00:00:16.049> next<00:00:16.320> asteroid<00:00:16.680> that's<00:00:17.490> gonna<00:00:17.760> come<00:00:18.300> near

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the next asteroid that's gonna come near

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.370 
the next asteroid that's gonna come near
us<00:00:18.630> point<00:00:19.109> eight<00:00:19.320> lunar<00:00:19.650> distances<00:00:20.130> away<00:00:21.109> yep

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
us point eight lunar distances away yep

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.279 
us point eight lunar distances away yep
that<00:00:22.650> means<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.250> closer<00:00:23.550> than<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> moon<00:00:24.300> yep

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that means it's closer than the moon yep

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.529 
that means it's closer than the moon yep
so<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.189> thought<00:00:26.340> maybe<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.789> poured<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.390> that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so we thought maybe we poured on that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.570 
so we thought maybe we poured on that
and<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> clone<00:00:28.109> gets<00:00:28.380> scared<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.429> have

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and then a clone gets scared and I have

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.179 
and then a clone gets scared and I have
