hi<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:02.129> Tony<00:00:02.340> Guerra<00:00:02.639> pharmd<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.600> wanted

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi I'm Tony Guerra pharmd and I wanted

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.880 
hi I'm Tony Guerra pharmd and I wanted
to<00:00:04.049> go<00:00:04.200> over<00:00:04.560> metoprolol<00:00:05.870> morphology<00:00:06.890> there's

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
to go over metoprolol morphology there's

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.230 
to go over metoprolol morphology there's
some<00:00:08.040> question<00:00:08.429> as<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.849> proper

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
some question as to the proper

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780 
some question as to the proper
pronunciation<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.309> now<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.370> question

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
pronunciation of it now the question

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.520 
pronunciation of it now the question
there<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.509> two<00:00:12.719> ways<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> pronounce<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
there are two ways to pronounce the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.499 
there are two ways to pronounce the
generic<00:00:13.860> beta-blocker<00:00:14.309> metoprolol<00:00:14.670> which<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
generic beta-blocker metoprolol which is

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.150 
generic beta-blocker metoprolol which is
correct<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.440> metoprolol

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
correct is it metoprolol

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.340 
correct is it metoprolol
or<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:17.970> meta<00:00:18.420> pro-law<00:00:20.570> first<00:00:21.570> what's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
or is it meta pro-law first what's

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
or is it meta pro-law first what's
morphology<00:00:23.060> second

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
morphology second

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.460 
morphology second
what's<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> morphology<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.140> other

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
what's the morphology of other

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.050 
what's the morphology of other
beta-blockers<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.880> in

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
beta-blockers so we can get this in

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.820 
beta-blockers so we can get this in
context<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.680> make<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
context to see if we can make a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.139 
context to see if we can make a
comparison<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:30.570> why<00:00:31.320> does<00:00:31.500> metoprolol

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
comparison and then why does metoprolol

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.830 
comparison and then why does metoprolol
violate<00:00:33.149> our<00:00:33.300> expectations<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> first<00:00:36.239> what

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
violate our expectations so first what

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.290 
violate our expectations so first what
is<00:00:36.870> morphology<00:00:37.620> let's<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.730> linguistic

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
is morphology let's look at linguistic

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.110 
is morphology let's look at linguistic
morphology<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.219> stem<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> root<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> has

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
morphology a stem is a root that has

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.709 
morphology a stem is a root that has
meeting<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> word<00:00:43.350> run<00:00:43.710> has<00:00:44.219> meaning

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
meeting so the word run has meaning

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.690 
meeting so the word run has meaning
you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> put<00:00:46.050> FX's<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> put<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you can put FX's on it you can put a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.240 
you can put FX's on it you can put a
prefix<00:00:48.210> something<00:00:48.870> before<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.680> run<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.129> make

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
prefix something before the run to make

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.979 
prefix something before the run to make
it<00:00:50.309> rerun<00:00:50.850> which<00:00:51.149> makes<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> completely

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
it rerun which makes it a completely

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.590 
it rerun which makes it a completely
different<00:00:52.110> word<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> suffix

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
different word or you can put a suffix

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.410 
different word or you can put a suffix
on<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.530> run<00:00:55.800> ER<00:00:55.910> which<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.270> the

the<00:04:23.310> third<00:04:23.550> sounds<00:04:23.940> awkward<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.810> both<00:04:24.990> cases

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
the third sounds awkward in both cases

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.200 
the third sounds awkward in both cases
so<00:04:25.890> we<00:04:26.040> don't<00:04:26.250> do<00:04:26.400> that

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
so we don't do that

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.809 
so we don't do that
but<00:04:27.569> in<00:04:27.870> two<00:04:28.440> different<00:04:30.740> references<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:31.979> found

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
stem we now have to split it and make

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.570 
stem we now have to split it and make
this<00:05:00.150> very<00:05:00.360> strange<00:05:00.840> five<00:05:01.320> one<00:05:01.560> five<00:05:01.740> five

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
five five one two one two and that's

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.640 
five five one two one two and that's
uncomfortable<00:05:06.120> for<00:05:06.539> us<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:06.990> because<00:05:07.440> of<00:05:07.500> that

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
uncomfortable for us and because of that

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.450 
uncomfortable for us and because of that
we<00:05:08.430> have<00:05:08.580> these<00:05:08.759> two<00:05:08.820> choices<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:10.770> there<00:05:11.340> are

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
we have these two choices so there are

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.610 
we have these two choices so there are
two<00:05:11.729> ways<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.720> pronounce<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.259> generic

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
two ways to pronounce the generic

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.249 
two ways to pronounce the generic
beta-blocker<00:05:14.130> metoprolol<00:05:14.630> which<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.810> correct

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
beta-blocker metoprolol which is correct

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.129 
beta-blocker metoprolol which is correct
well<00:05:16.949> there<00:05:17.729> really<00:05:17.759> isn't<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.419> correct<00:05:18.750> one<00:05:18.930> I

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
well there really isn't a correct one I

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.670 
well there really isn't a correct one I
found<00:05:19.889> both<00:05:20.490> reliable<00:05:21.270> references<00:05:22.020> one<00:05:22.409> says

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
found both reliable references one says

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.320 
found both reliable references one says
metoprolol<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.639> was<00:05:23.729> a<00:05:23.759> medical<00:05:24.000> dictionary

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
metoprolol it was a medical dictionary

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.140 
metoprolol it was a medical dictionary
and<00:05:24.900> one<00:05:25.500> says<00:05:25.770> meta<00:05:26.039> pro-law<00:05:26.490> this<00:05:26.849> is<00:05:27.000> one<00:05:27.120> of

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
and one says meta pro-law this is one of

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.809 
and one says meta pro-law this is one of
those<00:05:27.330> paid<00:05:27.630> online<00:05:28.050> references<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.669> go

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
those paid online references that you go

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.740 
those paid online references that you go
to<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:31.759> really<00:05:32.759> we<00:05:32.909> can<00:05:32.940> only<00:05:33.210> take<00:05:33.720> a

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
to so really we can only take a

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.560 
to so really we can only take a
descriptive<00:05:34.349> view<00:05:34.590> here<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.039> say<00:05:35.570> wherever

descriptive view here and say wherever
you're<00:05:36.750> at<00:05:36.780> that's<00:05:37.669> how<00:05:38.669> I<00:05:38.699> would<00:05:39.000> pronounce

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
you're at that's how I would pronounce

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.659 
you're at that's how I would pronounce
it<00:05:39.750> if<00:05:39.930> they<00:05:40.110> say<00:05:40.320> meta<00:05:40.530> pro-law<00:05:40.919> there<00:05:41.130> I'd

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
it if they say meta pro-law there I'd

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.360 
it if they say meta pro-law there I'd
say<00:05:42.110> pronounce<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.259> that<00:05:43.289> way<00:05:43.620> if<00:05:43.889> they<00:05:44.159> say

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
say pronounce it that way if they say

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.339 
say pronounce it that way if they say
metoprolol<00:05:44.729> there<00:05:45.300> I'd<00:05:45.599> pronounce<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.169> that

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
metoprolol there I'd pronounce it that

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.500 
metoprolol there I'd pronounce it that
way
