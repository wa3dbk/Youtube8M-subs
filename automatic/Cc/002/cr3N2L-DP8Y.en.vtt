do is you knit into the back of this

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.890 
do is you knit into the back of this
loop<00:02:50.500> if<00:02:51.340> you're<00:02:51.520> peeling<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.210> purl<00:02:52.510> into<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
loop if you're peeling you purl into the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.070 
loop if you're peeling you purl into the
back<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.370> peeling<00:02:54.790> what<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.450> would<00:02:55.570> do<00:02:55.750> is

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
back so for peeling what you would do is

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.620 
back so for peeling what you would do is
you'll<00:02:56.260> go<00:02:56.670> open<00:02:57.670> under<00:03:00.120> back<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:01.420> loop

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
you'll go open under back of that loop

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:10.740 
you'll go open under back of that loop
like<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:04.740> put<00:03:05.740> fur<00:03:05.980> mitting<00:03:09.630> instead<00:03:10.630> of

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
like that put fur mitting instead of

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.520 
like that put fur mitting instead of
going<00:03:11.610> up<00:03:12.610> like<00:03:12.850> that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
going up like that

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.170 
going up like that
you'll<00:03:14.530> go<00:03:15.570> underneath<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:17.590> loop<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.310> go

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
you'll go underneath that loop you go

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.140 
you'll go underneath that loop you go
underneath<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.980> up<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.380> would<00:03:23.500> knit<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
underneath and up if you would knit the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
underneath and up if you would knit the
back<00:03:27.990> of<00:03:28.990> that<00:03:29.200> stitch<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.840> will<00:03:32.020> ensure

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
back of that stitch and that will ensure

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.140 
back of that stitch and that will ensure
that<00:03:33.960> it<00:03:34.960> becomes<00:03:35.290> twisted<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> rest<00:03:36.970> of

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
that it becomes twisted like the rest of

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.810 
that it becomes twisted like the rest of
the<00:03:37.240> stitches<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:38.110> doesn't<00:03:39.010> leave<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.280> hole

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
the stitches and doesn't leave a hole

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:53.770 
the stitches and doesn't leave a hole
I<00:03:42.450> was<00:03:43.450> carry<00:03:43.750> on<00:03:43.870> knitting

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.040 

got<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.050> more<00:03:55.319> yarn<00:03:55.740> over

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
got one more yarn over

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.320 
got one more yarn over
so<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.170> just<00:03:58.260> knit<00:03:58.560> as<00:03:59.490> normal<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.209> that

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
so you just knit as normal and that

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:14.990 
so you just knit as normal and that
produces<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:01.370> whole

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.160 

so<00:04:16.000> now<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.180> can<00:04:16.390> see<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.750> holes<00:04:16.930> you've

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
so now you can see the holes you've

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:26.810 
so now you can see the holes you've
produced<00:04:17.590> by<00:04:18.370> spreading<00:04:18.730> out<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.120> stitches

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.610 

another<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.880> can<00:04:31.060> use<00:04:31.270> these<00:04:31.449> holes<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:32.470> make

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
another you can use these holes to make

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.180 
another you can use these holes to make
pretty<00:04:32.860> patterns<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.820> your<00:04:34.030> work
