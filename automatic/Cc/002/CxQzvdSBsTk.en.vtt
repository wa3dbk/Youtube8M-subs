00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.740
 both is light or is it is but 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.180
 It has not arrived yet, there have been good 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.790
 some problems with the system 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.590
 numbering already come to the moment that I'm going 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.850
 to remove a number through the drawing 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.730
 for many reasons 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.460
 listen to that that can understand me and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.740
 conscious maybe because of a failure there 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.990
 people who walk with fabrics all three 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.210
 entities with you on the trigger but 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.790
 forget the part of the bathtub 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.590
 and the place is full of blood but what 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.320
 good is that the accident of form of 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.320
 face and poor to the well- done 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.280
 how much time I take in doing that 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.640
 beautiful suit in first 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.309
 let me clarify something about this bank that is 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.409
 a great trend and greatly exaggerates not 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.269
 you come closer people I do not 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.540
 I will ask made after I am in the 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.750
 place I want to say that it is totally 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.030
 inefficient leads only one puts of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.080
 to seat him appropriate moods unfortunately 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.880
 I wear was made with a very pony 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.800
 it does not have an end 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.700
 do not think it 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.080
 they have fun and it is clear that yes which 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.400
 is your opinion about beings 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.990
 humans the dns w and the clubs and if it's 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.729
 very elongated by them 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.630
 if there is one thing that you have learned from the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.770
 life that is can give the best of you 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.039
 all 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.500
 outside the violence the cannibalism and the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.590
 bondage or whatever you do 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.469
 what is your favorite hobby and it will still happen 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.240
 when I beat cannibalism I like the 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.759
 violence 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.770
 and she if you are already a corpse that follows 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.420
 moving away until the last drop of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.899
 blood and tissue with a speed 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.360
 extraordinary speaks in a poly way but 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.170
 for me it's age no problem there 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.570
 a lot of life that I throw 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.170
 choke him to say it 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.440
 simply the most dishes could up 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.480
 go hungry or say good but if 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.170
 is next to that I'm afraid not 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:24.470
 can they make me the corpse and cut it like this 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.470
 that maybe I could use it as 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.760
 behind the home maybe we can see the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.030
 corpse as the lights of certain and color 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.450
 but the chimney be my theory I chose 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.230
 the atmosphere of this room 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:43.140
 it is said that the school is true today is 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.980
 the desert and that is a good one for and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 come on, come 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:57.400
 the jude group on dvd 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.400
 everything blooms and is a fucking ball 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.790
 i 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.790
 m 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.609
