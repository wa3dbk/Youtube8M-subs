00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
in this area that this is where the UI

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.779 
in this area that this is where the UI
is<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.780> that's<00:01:54.440> like<00:01:54.890> where<00:01:55.160> this<00:01:55.310> appears

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
is so that's like where this appears

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.520 
is so that's like where this appears
here<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.090> that's<00:01:56.360> why<00:01:56.539> there's<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.840> blank<00:01:57.170> space

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
here so that's why there's a blank space

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.169 
here so that's why there's a blank space
at<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.489> top<00:01:58.989> why<00:01:59.989> exactly<00:02:00.200> are<00:02:00.979> we<00:02:01.280> seeing<00:02:01.700> it

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
at the top why exactly are we seeing it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.839 
at the top why exactly are we seeing it
not<00:02:03.050> take<00:02:03.380> up<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.619> full<00:02:03.770> screen<00:02:04.099> so<00:02:04.580> because

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
not take up the full screen so because

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.729 
not take up the full screen so because
tablets<00:02:05.599> these<00:02:05.720> days<00:02:05.959> are<00:02:06.170> sixteen<00:02:06.560> by<00:02:06.709> nine

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
tablets these days are sixteen by nine

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.680 
tablets these days are sixteen by nine
which<00:02:07.250> means<00:02:07.550> it's<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.330> ratio<00:02:08.830> 16<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.009> 9

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
which means it's the ratio 16 to 9

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.020 
which means it's the ratio 16 to 9
height<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.870> width<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.550> fitting<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.000> to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
height to width so it's fitting it to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.360 
height to width so it's fitting it to
width<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.569> it's<00:02:15.470> doing<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.860> best<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.220> can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
width and it's doing the best it can

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.950 
width and it's doing the best it can
without<00:02:16.700> stretching<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.300> image<00:02:17.570> it's<00:02:17.750> kind

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
without stretching the image it's kind

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.090 
without stretching the image it's kind
of<00:02:17.990> like<00:02:18.110> fitting<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.500> square<00:02:18.830> into<00:02:18.980> a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
of like fitting a square into a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.670 
of like fitting a square into a
rectangle<00:02:19.610> you're<00:02:19.730> either<00:02:19.820> gonna<00:02:20.030> have<00:02:20.270> to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
rectangle you're either gonna have to

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.080 
rectangle you're either gonna have to
expand<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:22.280> that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
expand it like that

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.759 
expand it like that
to<00:02:23.300> get<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.569> height<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:23.900> then<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.140> lose<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
to get the height but then you lose the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.320 
to get the height but then you lose the
width<00:02:24.980> or<00:02:26.050> stretch<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.290> image<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.830> then<00:02:28.069> that

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
width or stretch the image and then that

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.759 
width or stretch the image and then that
when<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.690> it'll<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:30.019> be<00:02:30.110> distorted

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
when you do that it'll just be distorted

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.320 
when you do that it'll just be distorted
so<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.129> is<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.430> best<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.849> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.180> all

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
so this is the best of kind of all

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.559 
so this is the best of kind of all
worlds<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:32.959> one<00:02:33.170> has<00:02:33.379> to<00:02:33.410> wonder<00:02:33.910> does<00:02:34.910> do<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
worlds so one has to wonder does do you

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.449 
worlds so one has to wonder does do you
still<00:02:35.870> see<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.440> space<00:02:36.739> when<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:37.040> flip<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.340> the

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
still see this space when we flip it the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.190 
still see this space when we flip it the
landscape<00:02:37.879> mode<00:02:39.010> turn<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.160> give<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.330> tilt<00:02:41.599> we

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
landscape mode turn it give it a tilt we

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.059 
landscape mode turn it give it a tilt we
now<00:02:42.379> have<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> two<00:02:42.830> column<00:02:43.489> split<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.569> you<00:02:45.069> get

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
now have a two column split and you get

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.559 
now have a two column split and you get
a<00:02:46.099> little<00:02:46.280> bit<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.549> space<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:47.000> either<00:02:47.239> side

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
a little bit of space on either side

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.500 
a little bit of space on either side
