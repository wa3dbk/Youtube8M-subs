00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.150
 well we have a friend who is 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.459
 studying in the faculty 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.580
 We wanted to leave Machu Picchu 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.740
 the race ends 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.100
 Machu Picchu spent time 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.130
 this alter boy went on a trip and we 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.669
 we had known we are going to live together 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.460
 well it was not the time we had other 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.710
 the tour and I told him I want to do 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.329
 that trip 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.329
 well she told me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.450
 I will not leave all good airs 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.890
 well then this step this guy 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 she was traveling she started to see the photos of 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.520
 your blog 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.820
 if we go to it alone and there is a first 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.820
 increase 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.110
 the original idea was backpacks made 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 we were all two years saving 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 money and everything 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.970
 The first thing we bought was a backpack 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.820
 two years before leaving on a trip 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.680
 and everything was for the trip in the middle it 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.380
 we happened to do it on a motorcycle with sidecar 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.260
 with the ice cream cart no che guevara 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.050
 but we 're not so brave was a 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.810
 madness and then I go back to the backpack and 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.650
 We enjoyed a car a lot 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.650
 the holidays by car 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.880
 first because we look for a car 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.840
 economic and simple we knew a car 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.840
 for the entire tour 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.990
 but not knowing in all america just 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.149
 we find out all America of those who 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.600
 have then we wanted it 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.190
 that's why I do not like what I do 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.290
 like and she also did for pleasure 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.720
 and after finding out they told us there 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.050
 people who did it and the car arrives if 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.050
 it's good 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.940
 and the 281 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.740
 we think that mechanics and reality 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.740
 but 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.120
 labarta we also open a lot there is no 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.830
 many people who travel in old cars 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.140
 and before we left we did the engine 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.060
 Of course we fix it and I 'm good if it goes 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.280
 to break the truth there 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.730
 I have my tools for someone 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.730
 fix it 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.880
 and the car broke, we contacted a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.490
 mechanic of buenos aires that 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.140
 specializes in this type of car we 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.920
 recommended that spare parts carry because 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.709
 something was happening 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.910
 now the engine is pretty good but 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.500
 good all the problems he had 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.270
 they were part of the engine between 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.670
 Front and career management the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.200
 pump direction of nothing if the pump of the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.239
 Brake 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.319
 the car sends well but if not 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.319
 treatment that is why 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 when you have grandparents you are also 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.560
 we make 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.720
 and we always try to have some 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.210
 contact or something in the country from where 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.510
 we're 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.330
 for anything the worst thing that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.080
 It can happen to you is that you get sick or that 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.180
 pass something to the car luckily to the car 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.420
 that is, everything that happened to him could be 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.450
 solve how much good is is silver 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.040
 that from somewhere we took it 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.780
 but luckily that is, it has not happened to us 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.900
 we are not beyond any 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.329
 breakdown if something we ate 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.130
 and suffer a little bit to the height in the 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:07.970
 peace fortunately nothing happened to us like this 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.030
 Serious supplies of lentils flour 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.650
