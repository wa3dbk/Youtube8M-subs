firstly this is the Nick 95 rod made by
mechanika<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> day<00:00:27.420> ez<00:00:27.920> must<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.099> the

can actually turn this part down and it
just<00:00:59.340> means<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.300> extra<00:01:00.809> piece<00:01:01.010> if

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you're fishing with three rods is now

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
you're fishing with three rods is now
down<00:01:04.199> below<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.949> looks<00:01:05.850> nice<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> neat<00:01:08.510> the

down below just looks nice and neat the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
down below just looks nice and neat the
other<00:01:09.659> thing<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.350> about<00:01:10.380> his<00:01:10.650> rod

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
other thing I really like about his rod

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
other thing I really like about his rod
Ford<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> fact<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> don't<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.240> any

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
Ford is the fact that you don't have any

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.520 
Ford is the fact that you don't have any
movement<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> reason<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.530> if

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
movement this way and the reason is if

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.969 
movement this way and the reason is if
you<00:01:16.740> undo<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.310> part<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you undo this part here this is how it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.719 
you undo this part here this is how it
folds<00:01:20.340> down<00:01:21.020> okay<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.500> assembly<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.340> for

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
folds down okay for assembly and for

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
folds down okay for assembly and for
putting<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> together<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.590> means

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
putting it together and it just means

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.760 
putting it together and it just means
you<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.220> any<00:01:26.540> movement<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.530> way

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you don't have any movement this way

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
you don't have any movement this way
which<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.159> sometimes<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.939> other<00:01:30.060> rod

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
which you sometimes get with other rod

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
pots you know the good thing with this

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.490 
pots you know the good thing with this

design<00:01:34.860> here<00:01:35.520> which<00:01:36.090> also<00:01:36.329> means<00:01:36.720> when<00:01:37.110> you're

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.700 

extending<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.579> putting<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.630> again<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
extending it or putting it in again you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.819 
extending it or putting it in again you
don't<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.040> any<00:01:44.220> movement<00:01:45.200> this<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.470> which

don't get any movement this way which

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.319 
don't get any movement this way which
you<00:01:46.979> sometimes<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
you sometimes get when you have the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539 
you sometimes get when you have the
single<00:01:48.659> bar<00:01:48.930> design<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> single<00:01:50.130> tube

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.639 

one<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.570> very<00:01:54.720> good<00:01:55.049> thing<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.439> rod

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
one other very good thing with this rod

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.010 
one other very good thing with this rod
father<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
father I really like and this is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
father I really like and this is
probably<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> main<00:01:59.430> reasons<00:02:00.030> why

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
probably one of the main reasons why

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
probably one of the main reasons why
I've<00:02:00.600> switched<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.090> actually<00:02:03.770> rotate

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
I've switched is you can actually rotate

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.080 
I've switched is you can actually rotate
the<00:02:05.159> pod<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.350> 360<00:02:07.350> degree

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the pod on a 360 degree

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.640 
the pod on a 360 degree
Kengo<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.709> benefit<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.260> want<00:02:14.440> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
Kengo the benefit of this if you want to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.770 
Kengo the benefit of this if you want to
change<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.220> position<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.640> your<00:02:15.700> rods<00:02:16.030> it

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
change the position of your rods it

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.900 
change the position of your rods it
means<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.140> don't<00:02:17.290> have<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.680> take<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.550> pod<00:02:18.700> out

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
means you don't have to take the pod out

is the camouflage finish now they do two

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.910 
is the camouflage finish now they do two
types<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.720> camouflage<00:03:52.900> they<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.620> green

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
types of camouflage they do a green

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.319 
types of camouflage they do a green
camouflage<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.819> they<00:03:54.910> do<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> brown

camouflage and they do a brown

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.360 
camouflage and they do a brown
camouflage<00:03:55.930> I've<00:03:56.620> gone<00:03:56.829> for<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.130> green

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
camouflage I've gone for the green

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.809 
camouflage I've gone for the green
camouflage<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:59.130> brown<00:04:00.130> camouflage<00:04:00.549> it's

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
camouflage and brown camouflage it's

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.729 
camouflage and brown camouflage it's
very<00:04:01.000> similar<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.079> depends<00:04:02.470> on<00:04:02.560> your

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
very similar it just depends on your

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.720 
very similar it just depends on your
taste<00:04:03.569> it's<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.660> very<00:04:04.870> delicate<00:04:05.170> finish<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.430> if

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
taste it's a very delicate finish so if

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.870 
taste it's a very delicate finish so if
you're<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.329> type<00:04:07.569> of<00:04:07.600> angler<00:04:08.139> who<00:04:08.880> doesn't

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
you're the type of angler who doesn't

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.460 
you're the type of angler who doesn't
look<00:04:10.150> after<00:04:10.450> their<00:04:10.569> equipment<00:04:11.049> very<00:04:11.230> well

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
look after their equipment very well

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.860 
look after their equipment very well
then<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.190> rod<00:04:12.430> pod<00:04:12.639> probably<00:04:13.060> is<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.569> finish

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
then this rod pod probably is the finish

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.050 
then this rod pod probably is the finish
for<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.260> they<00:04:14.769> do<00:04:14.829> a<00:04:14.950> black<00:04:15.310> finish<00:04:15.639> which<00:04:16.030> is

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
for you they do a black finish which is

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.390 
for you they do a black finish which is
more<00:04:16.389> durable<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.289> they<00:04:17.440> also<00:04:17.590> do<00:04:17.889> a<00:04:17.919> silver

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
more durable and they also do a silver

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.159 
more durable and they also do a silver
finish<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:19.359> thing<00:04:19.539> I<00:04:19.630> like<00:04:19.810> about<00:04:19.840> the

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
finish the thing I like about the

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.840 
finish the thing I like about the
camouflage<00:04:20.470> finish<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.370> don't<00:04:21.579> get<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
camouflage finish is you don't get the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.029 
camouflage finish is you don't get the
reflection<00:04:22.210> off<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.660> Sun<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.650> if<00:04:23.830> you're

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
reflection off the Sun so if you're

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.810 
reflection off the Sun so if you're
you're<00:04:24.550> trying<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.820> be<00:04:24.910> discreet<00:04:25.479> or<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.320> just

of the rods when you're fishing and this
is<00:04:30.430> probably<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.850> finish<00:04:31.150> for<00:04:31.360> you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.750 

I<00:04:39.810> used<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.500> be<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.650> technology<00:04:41.280> teacher<00:04:41.460> in

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
I used to be a technology teacher in

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.840 
I used to be a technology teacher in
England<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.590> one<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.770> my<00:04:43.890> specialities<00:04:44.190> was

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
England and one of my specialities was

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.990 
England and one of my specialities was
product<00:04:45.210> development<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:45.990> evaluation

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
product development and evaluation

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.880 
product development and evaluation
I<00:04:48.000> certainly<00:04:48.570> recognized<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.440> good<00:04:49.620> product

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
I certainly recognized a good product

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.640 
I certainly recognized a good product
when<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.190> see<00:04:50.460> one<00:04:50.730> and<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.540> was<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.930> was<00:04:52.230> just<00:04:52.260> sold

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
when I see one and I was I was just sold

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.260 
when I see one and I was I was just sold
on<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.950> engineering<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.850> quality<00:04:54.240> of

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
on the engineering and the quality of

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.510 
on the engineering and the quality of
finish<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:55.440> get<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.650> little<00:04:55.950> bit<00:04:56.070> more<00:04:56.250> weight

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
finish you get a little bit more weight

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.630 
finish you get a little bit more weight
with<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:56.940> rod<00:04:57.210> pod<00:04:57.480> but<00:04:58.140> when<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.830> consider

bear

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
bear

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.930 
bear
and<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:08.100> doesn't<00:05:08.280> mean<00:05:08.490> you've<00:05:08.610> got<00:05:08.760> more

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
and it doesn't mean you've got more

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.150 
and it doesn't mean you've got more
stability<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.660> strong<00:05:09.960> winds<00:05:10.230> now<00:05:10.830> talking

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
stability and strong winds now talking

stability and strong winds now talking
about<00:05:11.340> stability<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.090> strong<00:05:12.480> wind<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:12.990> I

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
about stability and strong wind so I

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.320 
about stability and strong wind so I
just<00:05:13.170> want<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.470> say<00:05:13.620> one<00:05:13.920> more<00:05:14.190> great<00:05:14.970> feature

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
just want to say one more great feature

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.480 
just want to say one more great feature
about<00:05:15.480> this<00:05:15.810> rod<00:05:16.080> pod<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.980> can<00:05:17.100> actually

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
about this rod pod you can actually

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.780 
about this rod pod you can actually
remove<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.120> legs<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.520> can<00:05:20.550> actually

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
remove the legs and you can actually

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.000 
remove the legs and you can actually
position<00:05:21.510> them<00:05:21.660> into<00:05:21.960> this<00:05:22.080> part<00:05:22.410> here<00:05:22.740> which

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
position them into this part here which

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.010 
position them into this part here which
means<00:05:23.280> you've<00:05:23.460> got<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.760> more<00:05:23.970> stable<00:05:24.300> rod<00:05:24.750> pod

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
means you've got the more stable rod pod

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.890 
means you've got the more stable rod pod
if<00:05:25.560> you've<00:05:25.710> got<00:05:25.890> very<00:05:25.920> very<00:05:26.400> strong<00:05:26.850> winds<00:05:27.150> and

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
if you've got very very strong winds and

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.380 
if you've got very very strong winds and
you<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.170> need<00:05:28.320> a<00:05:28.350> little<00:05:28.530> bit<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:28.920> stability

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
you just need a little bit of stability

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.740 
you just need a little bit of stability
get<00:05:30.390> an<00:05:30.510> allen<00:05:30.810> key<00:05:30.840> supplied<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:33.270> legs<00:05:33.510> here

get an allen key supplied the legs here

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.260 
get an allen key supplied the legs here
you<00:05:34.320> can<00:05:34.470> attach<00:05:34.560> them<00:05:34.980> into<00:05:35.250> these<00:05:35.400> parts

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:06:08.060 

scuffling<00:05:41.230> all<00:05:41.500> set<00:05:41.770> on<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.580> ground

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.550 

this<00:06:09.070> is<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.400> knick<00:06:09.610> 95<00:06:10.240> version<00:06:10.900> there<00:06:11.380> are

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
this is the knick 95 version there are

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.620 
this is the knick 95 version there are
two<00:06:11.860> other<00:06:12.040> models<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.640> mechanika<00:06:13.510> the

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
two other models that mechanika the

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.450 
two other models that mechanika the
Daisy<00:06:13.810> mate<00:06:14.200> there's<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.680> technique<00:06:15.190> and

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
Daisy mate there's the technique and

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.020 
Daisy mate there's the technique and
there's<00:06:16.240> an<00:06:16.360> evolution<00:06:17.050> now<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:18.220> technique

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
there's an evolution now the technique

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.520 
there's an evolution now the technique
just<00:06:19.840> has<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.470> one<00:06:20.500> two<00:06:20.980> here<00:06:21.610> and<00:06:21.960> also<00:06:22.960> it's

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
just has the one two here and also it's

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.440 
just has the one two here and also it's
lighter<00:06:23.800> in<00:06:24.100> weight<00:06:24.330> it's<00:06:25.710> five<00:06:26.710> kilos<00:06:27.420> okay

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
lighter in weight it's five kilos okay

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.590 
lighter in weight it's five kilos okay
and<00:06:28.630> also<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:30.370> legs<00:06:30.610> don't<00:06:30.910> come<00:06:31.150> off<00:06:31.300> here<00:06:31.540> so

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
and also the legs don't come off here so

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.540 
and also the legs don't come off here so
you<00:06:31.900> can't<00:06:32.200> actually<00:06:32.410> attach<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:32.890> legs<00:06:33.250> onto

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
you can't actually attach the legs onto

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.600 
you can't actually attach the legs onto
this<00:06:33.670> part<00:06:33.970> but<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:35.230> legs<00:06:35.470> splay<00:06:36.100> out<00:06:36.130> more

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
this part but the legs splay out more

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.400 
this part but the legs splay out more
you<00:06:36.850> have<00:06:37.000> more<00:06:37.030> of<00:06:37.270> a<00:06:37.450> degree<00:06:37.780> of<00:06:37.810> an<00:06:37.990> angle<00:06:38.380> so

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
you have more of a degree of an angle so

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.080 
you have more of a degree of an angle so
you've<00:06:38.740> got<00:06:38.860> more<00:06:39.010> stability

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.590 

the<00:06:42.810> evolution<00:06:43.560> has<00:06:44.250> the<00:06:44.550> twin<00:06:44.850> pipe<00:06:45.150> design

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
the evolution has the twin pipe design

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.500 
the evolution has the twin pipe design
it's<00:06:46.530> six<00:06:46.980> kilos<00:06:47.430> it's<00:06:47.700> a<00:06:47.790> little<00:06:48.060> bit<00:06:48.180> heavier

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
it's six kilos it's a little bit heavier

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.580 
it's six kilos it's a little bit heavier
okay

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
okay

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.690 
okay
and<00:06:49.710> it<00:06:49.889> just<00:06:50.010> means<00:06:50.190> you've<00:06:50.460> got<00:06:50.580> the

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
and it just means you've got the

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.760 
and it just means you've got the
benefits<00:06:51.150> of<00:06:51.330> having<00:06:51.450> the<00:06:51.690> twin<00:06:51.930> tubes<00:06:52.320> so

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
benefits of having the twin tubes so

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.830 
benefits of having the twin tubes so
you've<00:06:52.919> just<00:06:53.070> got<00:06:53.220> the<00:06:53.370> more<00:06:53.970> splay<00:06:54.330> but<00:06:54.660> more

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
you've just got the more splay but more

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.750 
you've just got the more splay but more
stability<00:06:55.139> down<00:06:55.800> on<00:06:55.950> it<00:06:56.070> and<00:06:56.130> on<00:06:56.220> this<00:06:56.370> part<00:06:56.639> of

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
stability down on it and on this part of

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.650 
stability down on it and on this part of
the<00:06:56.850> pod

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.300 

okay<00:07:00.660> so<00:07:00.720> you've<00:07:00.900> got<00:07:01.020> the<00:07:01.140> Nick<00:07:01.290> 95<00:07:01.860> which<00:07:02.160> is

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
okay so you've got the Nick 95 which is

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.250 
okay so you've got the Nick 95 which is
the<00:07:02.430> one<00:07:02.580> I'm<00:07:02.730> using<00:07:02.940> here<00:07:03.300> you've<00:07:03.990> got<00:07:04.140> the

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
the one I'm using here you've got the
