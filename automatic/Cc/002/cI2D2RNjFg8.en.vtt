GUITAR - ELENA SADKO

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.080
My guitar is my best friend

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.240
I can’t let you out of my hands

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.420
We walked together along one hundred roads

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.780
And our life wasn’t easy

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.780
Sing and cry for me

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.020
All my life is in you, my guitar

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.560
Distant countries and cities you see more than I did

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.100
There are strength and power in your strings

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.360
And eternity has frozen there too

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.880
Sing and cry for me

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.900
All my life is in you, my guitar

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.760
You cure my wounds, take the pain away

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.400
I’m honest with you tête-à-tête

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.760
And you are giving me a melody again

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.060
And now I’m flying like in a dream

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.700
Sing and cry for me

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.580
All my life is in you, my guitar

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.260
All my life is in you, my guitar
