00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 good that you gave me not once more if 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.430
 these hands I am here to have be 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.649
 free photo editor for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.090
 Android number 5 nothing editor that all 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.440
 the people the vif and kings and that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.209
 let's see it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.339
 well then nothing else to enter the program 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.789
 the application the first thing that you will see will be 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.560
 this tab here we have two options 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.140
 is the career option an image 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.329
 change the role and then the option to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 take a picture and then edit 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.649
 the camera view and well then here 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.210
 below we have explores to see the 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.390
 images that people have hung and everything 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.710
 that and the solution is really good the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.350
 upload an image 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.240
 and well we just do to the gallery 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.680
 and we select the image that we want 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.480
 well, a download of the image 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.640
 we will have this tab here 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.860
 the first little eyelash that will serve us 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.690
 is that of leeds and here below we have 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.060
 all the effects that we can add that 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.670
 are not few good among them is therefore 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.770
 modify the color modify the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.070
 saturation give contrast to shine 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.740
 rotate the image and nothing then to add 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.380
 effect we have to explain above and 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.290
 we will leave the options that for 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.540
 modify the effect that the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.640
 very good here such as 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.430
 we can modify the degree or put 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.520
 more brightness and lower the brightness in 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.760
 contrast in this case after the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.870
 second tab is the effects 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.870
 to the load 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.750
 well, nothing here we just have down 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.760
 all the effects thus stops closing 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.620
 we have here below all the effects that 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.980
 we can add between them is the 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.240
 paint black and white to add as if 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.670
 out more temperature 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.740
 the typical ones that both the programs are 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.660
 quite the truth nothing this simply 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.180
 is to give the effect more or less the same as 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.480
 the other and we can also modify the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.700
 grade 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.200
 if we want it to be seen completely 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.330
 one hundred percent that effect we want to be 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.700
 see less simply die zeit after 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.530
 of salt and the good effect is already added 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.880
 finally we have the frames tab 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.370
 and here nothing is the same 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.250
 we select the frame that we want 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.280
 we give and here we skip the options that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.540
 we have with the framework in this case is 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.540
 move the image so that you see a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.830
 part or another at some time we have it 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.450
 modified as we want the girl to tic 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.460
 and ready 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.050
 and nothing these are all effects that brings 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.470
 after having added to everything 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.210
 You want oil, and well, there 's the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.900
 option to save the gallery to hang it 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.890
 a beat funk and facebook twitter or tumblr 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.510
 well, this would be all that we 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.220
 brings this application the truth is that it is 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.770
 a good editor and I recommend that what 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.690
 you try so nothing as you always have 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.820
 linke descriptions of the project for 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.980
 download it and nothing else to tell us in 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.980
 a week that comes with a new video 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.980
 goodbye
