dive and have to search places with one
meter<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.579> meter<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.910> sent<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
meter or two meter just sent put the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.319 
meter or two meter just sent put the
camera<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:55.949> put<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> right

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
camera up there put it in the right

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420 
camera up there put it in the right
position<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> Sun<00:00:58.320> comes<00:00:58.680> behind<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
position that the Sun comes behind and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
position that the Sun comes behind and
then<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> perfect<00:01:00.390> picture<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
spot and the rig and then place the rig

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.380 
spot and the rig and then place the rig
perfect<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.240> we're

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
perfect out and that's it so so we're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060

better last year we've chased a battery
pack<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> housing<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.810> between<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
pack with the housing and between was a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.469 
pack with the housing and between was a
plastic<00:01:32.040> pole<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.790> would<00:01:33.030> change<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
plastic pole this would change the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
plastic pole this would change the
aluminum<00:01:34.049> now<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> plastic<00:01:35.009> placer

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
aluminum now because the plastic placer

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.899 
aluminum now because the plastic placer
pro<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.790> broke<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:37.110> next<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.680> change<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
pro can broke the next we change to the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.819 
pro can broke the next we change to the
perfect<00:01:39.390> balls<00:01:39.600> inna<00:01:39.780> grass<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.530> come<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
perfect balls inna grass is to come a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.350 
perfect balls inna grass is to come a
flash<00:01:41.189> coating<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:42.210> so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
flash coating right so

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.290 
flash coating right so
like<00:01:43.600> piscina<00:01:44.170> grass<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.860> we<00:01:45.610> will<00:01:45.820> see<00:01:46.030> at

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
like piscina grass and we will see at

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.230 
like piscina grass and we will see at
the<00:01:46.690> footage<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.470> fish<00:01:47.710> doesn't<00:01:48.250> doesn't

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
the footage the fish doesn't doesn't

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.330 
the footage the fish doesn't doesn't
care<00:01:49.390> what<00:01:49.780> are<00:01:49.900> what<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:50.500> they<00:01:50.710> they

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
care what are what it is so they they

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.790
