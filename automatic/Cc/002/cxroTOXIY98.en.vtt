hi<00:00:04.290> I'm<00:00:04.500> Andy<00:00:04.770> Segal<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.670> shot<00:00:05.879> here<00:00:06.210> is

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
hi I'm Andy Segal this shot here is

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.839 
hi I'm Andy Segal this shot here is
called<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.899> banana<00:00:07.230> shot<00:00:07.620> it's<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.370> second

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
called the banana shot it's the second

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.700 
called the banana shot it's the second
in<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.269> series<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.630> four<00:00:09.929> draw<00:00:10.230> shots<00:00:10.559> that

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
in a series of four draw shots that

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.620 
in a series of four draw shots that
we're<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:12.090> reason<00:00:12.269> why<00:00:12.480> it's

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
we're going to do the reason why it's

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.509 
we're going to do the reason why it's
called<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> banana<00:00:13.200> shot<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:14.070> because<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
called the banana shot is because the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.680 
called the banana shot is because the
cue<00:00:14.700> ball<00:00:14.849> doesn't<00:00:15.150> go<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> straight<00:00:15.420> line

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
cue ball doesn't go in a straight line

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.109 
cue ball doesn't go in a straight line
it<00:00:16.199> follows<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.830> curved<00:00:17.130> path<00:00:17.460> kind<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.000> like

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
it follows the curved path kind of like

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.560 
it follows the curved path kind of like
a<00:00:18.359> banana<00:00:19.189> anyway<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.060> see<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> cue

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a banana anyway you can see that the cue

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.240 
a banana anyway you can see that the cue
ball<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.109> trapped<00:00:22.500> between<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.100> one

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
ball here is trapped between the one

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.640 
ball here is trapped between the one
ball<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.670> cushion<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.350> also<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> two

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
ball and the cushion and also the two

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.740 
ball and the cushion and also the two
ball<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> direct<00:00:26.789> path<00:00:26.880> between<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
ball is in the direct path between the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.769 
ball is in the direct path between the
cue<00:00:27.990> ball<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> eight<00:00:29.119> now<00:00:30.119> obviously<00:00:30.570> in

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
cue ball and the eight now obviously in

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.669 
cue ball and the eight now obviously in
the<00:00:30.840> game<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.109> eight<00:00:31.260> ball

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the game of eight ball

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.560 
the game of eight ball
I<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> sync<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> eight<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> win<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I want to sync the eight to win and I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.660 
I want to sync the eight to win and I
can't<00:00:33.930> hit<00:00:34.200> any<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> solids<00:00:35.250> first<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.550> have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
can't hit any of the solids first I have

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.720 
can't hit any of the solids first I have
58<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.579> I'm

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
58 first so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.040 
58 first so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> shoot<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> cue<00:00:39.329> ball<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
going to shoot the cue ball into the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.350 
going to shoot the cue ball into the
cushion<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:41.250> happens<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.030> cue<00:00:42.210> ball

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
cushion what happens is the cue ball

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
cushion what happens is the cue ball
compresses<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> rail<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.040> giving<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
compresses the rail like this giving it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.319 
compresses the rail like this giving it
enough<00:00:45.300> space<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:46.289> come<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:47.000> around<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> one

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
enough space to come out around the one

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:59.060 
enough space to come out around the one
without<00:00:48.989> touching<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:57.859> all<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:59.039> doing

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
without touching it so all I'm doing

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.060 
without touching it so all I'm doing
here<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:00:59.760> shooting<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> cue<00:01:00.600> ball

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
here is I'm shooting the cue ball

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
here is I'm shooting the cue ball
somewhere<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.280> area<00:01:03.110> just<00:01:04.110> pass<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
somewhere in this area just pass the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.149 
somewhere in this area just pass the
third<00:01:04.680> diamond<00:01:04.970> with<00:01:05.970> straight<00:01:06.270> backspin<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
third diamond with straight backspin and

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.380 
third diamond with straight backspin and
the<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> set<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the way you set this up is I have the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
the way you set this up is I have the
cue<00:01:09.600> ball<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:10.430> between<00:01:11.430> these<00:01:11.729> two

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
cue ball right between these two

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.480 
cue ball right between these two
diamonds<00:01:12.240> frozen<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> rail<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.310> ball

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
diamonds frozen to the rail the one ball

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
diamonds frozen to the rail the one ball
frozen<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.030> cue<00:01:15.270> ball<00:01:15.450> directly<00:01:15.780> across

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
frozen to the cue ball directly across

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
frozen to the cue ball directly across
the<00:01:16.500> table<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.880> eight<00:01:18.030> ball<00:01:18.210> hanging<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the table the eight ball hanging in the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.469 
the table the eight ball hanging in the
pocket<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.860> two<00:01:20.009> ball<00:01:20.250> well<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.240> two

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
pocket and the two ball well the two

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.420 
pocket and the two ball well the two
ball<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.780> about<00:01:22.049> maybe<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.920> between<00:01:23.070> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
ball is about maybe right between this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.149 
ball is about maybe right between this
diamond<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> side<00:01:24.210> pocket

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
diamond in the side pocket

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
diamond in the side pocket
maybe<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.970> third<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> way<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.259> from

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
maybe about a third of the way out from

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
maybe about a third of the way out from
this<00:01:28.619> rail<00:01:28.860> basically<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:29.909> want<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
this rail basically you just want it to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.289 
this rail basically you just want it to
be<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.850> cue<00:01:33.030> ball<00:01:33.060> going

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
be in the way of the cue ball going

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.160 
be in the way of the cue ball going
straight<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> aid<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.170> straight

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
straight into the aid so straight

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.980 
straight into the aid so straight
backspin<00:01:37.619> into<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> rail<00:01:38.509> slightly<00:01:39.509> left<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
backspin into the rail slightly left of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.469 
backspin into the rail slightly left of
the<00:01:40.290> third<00:01:40.530> diamond

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.590 

all<00:01:45.469> right<00:01:45.799> now<00:01:45.979> why<00:01:46.399> did<00:01:46.549> I<00:01:46.640> miss<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:47.030> well

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
all right now why did I miss that well

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.260 
all right now why did I miss that well
the<00:01:48.380> cue<00:01:48.590> ball<00:01:48.799> never<00:01:49.219> curved<00:01:49.640> enough<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.149> get

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
the cue ball never curved enough to get

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.270 
the cue ball never curved enough to get
to<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.479> 8<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.890> mean<00:01:51.979> one<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.159> two

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
to the 8 so that can mean one of two

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.459 
to the 8 so that can mean one of two
things<00:01:52.610> either<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.600> didn't<00:01:53.960> hit<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:54.200> hard

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
things either I didn't hit it hard

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.819 
things either I didn't hit it hard
enough<00:01:54.560> with<00:01:55.399> enough<00:01:55.429> backspin<00:01:56.149> or<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.990> aim<00:01:57.500> too

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
enough with enough backspin or I aim too

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.440 
enough with enough backspin or I aim too
far<00:01:58.100> down<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.429> table<00:01:58.820> which<00:01:58.939> means<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.270> cue

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
far down the table which means the cue

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.559 
far down the table which means the cue
ball<00:01:59.600> took<00:01:59.780> too<00:02:00.020> long<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:01.310> an<00:02:01.399> angle<00:02:01.759> in<00:02:01.909> this

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
ball took too long of an angle in this

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.029 
ball took too long of an angle in this
case<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:03.049> don't<00:02:03.110> think<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.439> cue<00:02:03.619> ball<00:02:03.740> took<00:02:03.860> too

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
case I don't think the cue ball took too

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.190 
case I don't think the cue ball took too
long<00:02:04.069> of<00:02:04.310> an<00:02:04.399> angle<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.850> did<00:02:05.030> go<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.390> way<00:02:05.600> but

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
long of an angle it did go this way but

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.450 
long of an angle it did go this way but
I<00:02:06.229> don't<00:02:06.439> think<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.649> hit<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.860> with<00:02:06.979> enough<00:02:07.219> facts

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
I don't think I hit it with enough facts

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.669 
I don't think I hit it with enough facts
then<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.599> I'm<00:02:08.720> going<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.869> hit<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.110> cue<00:02:09.289> ball<00:02:09.319> a

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
then so I'm going to hit the cue ball a

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.250 
then so I'm going to hit the cue ball a
little<00:02:09.920> lower<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:11.180> ball<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.540> time<00:02:11.599> to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
little lower on the ball this time to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.699 
little lower on the ball this time to
give<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.530> more<00:02:12.739> backspin<00:02:17.319> all<00:02:18.319> right<00:02:18.530> what

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
give it more backspin all right what

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.920 
give it more backspin all right what
happened<00:02:19.040> there<00:02:19.220> well<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.209> think<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.569> over

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
happened there well I think I over

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.930 
happened there well I think I over
adjusted<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.920> hit<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.190> cue<00:02:22.370> ball<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.549> little

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
adjusted and I hit the cue ball a little

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.900 
adjusted and I hit the cue ball a little
too<00:02:23.269> low<00:02:23.540> with<00:02:24.140> too<00:02:24.410> much<00:02:24.560> backspin<00:02:25.069> so<00:02:25.730> what

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
too low with too much backspin so what

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.699 
too low with too much backspin so what
happened<00:02:26.299> is<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.660> cue<00:02:26.870> ball<00:02:27.019> came<00:02:27.260> out<00:02:27.290> along

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
happened is the cue ball came out along

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.589 
happened is the cue ball came out along
the<00:02:27.829> right<00:02:28.010> line<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:28.880> instead<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.269> curving

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
the right line but instead of curving

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.130 
the right line but instead of curving
here<00:02:30.579> it<00:02:31.579> came<00:02:31.849> out<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.239> curved<00:02:32.480> here<00:02:32.959> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
here it came out and curved here and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.069 
here it came out and curved here and
went<00:02:33.769> into<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.069> 2<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.360> what<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.840> do<00:02:35.959> is

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
went into the 2 so what I have to do is

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.509 
went into the 2 so what I have to do is
they<00:02:36.170> have<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.349> find<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.709> happy<00:02:37.010> medium<00:02:37.040> and

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
they have to find a happy medium and

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.180 
they have to find a happy medium and
shoot<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.360> kind<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.930> right<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.290> between<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
shoot it kind of right in between the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.940 
shoot it kind of right in between the
first<00:02:40.370> two<00:02:40.549> attempts

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.619 

and<00:02:47.040> that's<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.000> way<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.120> win<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.360> game<00:02:48.510> of
