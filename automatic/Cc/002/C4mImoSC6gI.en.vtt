00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
much was that to 459 on you then sell

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.590 
much was that to 459 on you then sell
for<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:56.640> 24<00:03:57.640> 55<00:03:58.450> and<00:04:00.120> then<00:04:01.120> we're<00:04:01.420> going<00:04:01.510> to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
for like 24 55 and then we're going to

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.920 
for like 24 55 and then we're going to
start<00:04:01.750> selling

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.180 

hopefully

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.059 

yep<00:04:11.090> cheap

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.960 

sold<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.879> lot<00:04:14.909> instantly<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:16.070> if<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.340> sells<00:04:17.549> too

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
sold a lot instantly but if it sells too

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.740 
sold a lot instantly but if it sells too
fast<00:04:18.269> like<00:04:18.600> if<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.900> sells<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.380> basically<00:04:19.979> the

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
fast like if it sells like basically the

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.930 
fast like if it sells like basically the
moment<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.810> sell<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.079> then<00:04:22.520> that's<00:04:23.520> not<00:04:23.759> good

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
moment you sell it then that's not good

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.210 
moment you sell it then that's not good
you<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.930> should<00:04:25.199> like<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:26.039> should

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
you you should like you should

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.740 
you you should like you should
definitely<00:04:26.400> take<00:04:26.699> them<00:04:26.910> out<00:04:27.090> as<00:04:27.330> quickly<00:04:27.630> as

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
definitely take them out as quickly as

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.820 
definitely take them out as quickly as
possible<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.169> then<00:04:28.229> raise<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> price

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
possible and then raise the price

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.700 
possible and then raise the price
because<00:04:29.160> if<00:04:29.310> they're<00:04:29.460> selling<00:04:29.729> too<00:04:29.880> fast<00:04:30.120> then

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
because if they're selling too fast then

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.930 
because if they're selling too fast then
that<00:04:31.710> means<00:04:31.830> you're<00:04:31.979> not<00:04:32.220> getting<00:04:32.639> enough

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
that means you're not getting enough

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.779 
that means you're not getting enough
profit<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:34.830> know<00:04:34.979> like<00:04:35.370> because<00:04:35.610> you're
