when I actually found the lump just

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.410 
when I actually found the lump just
thought<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.369> know<00:00:25.490> maybe<00:00:25.699> he<00:00:25.910> got<00:00:26.060> sick<00:00:26.390> and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
thought you know maybe he got sick and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.140 
thought you know maybe he got sick and
it<00:00:26.779> was<00:00:26.810> a<00:00:26.900> lymph<00:00:27.140> node<00:00:27.380> that<00:00:27.410> was<00:00:27.830> just

it was a lymph node that was just

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.820 
it was a lymph node that was just
enlarged<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.359> it<00:00:29.449> would<00:00:29.599> go<00:00:29.750> away<00:00:29.869> for<00:00:30.320> about

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
enlarged and it would go away for about

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.230 
enlarged and it would go away for about
a<00:00:30.980> year<00:00:31.820> it<00:00:32.060> stayed<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:33.250> got<00:00:34.250> bigger<00:00:34.490> and<00:00:34.910> so

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
a year it stayed and got bigger and so

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.480 
a year it stayed and got bigger and so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you know to get checkups so we know the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.200 
you know to get checkups so we know the
nurses<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.870> know<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.530> doctors<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.550> definitely

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
nurses we know the doctors so definitely

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030

I think the compassion that was shown to
us<00:01:34.440> is<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> essential<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.230> healing<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.950> you're
