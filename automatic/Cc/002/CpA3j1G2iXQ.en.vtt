00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.740
 the wsb it went very well too 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.539
 neglected year six wins out of seven 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.460
 fights I was able to discover a new 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.279
 championship team spirit 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.890
 but after I read continue bea group 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.750
 for failure to comply with the contract there was 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.130
 a three-year contract and wanted it 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.460
 break the contract after eight months 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.320
 activity and also for non-payment of 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.690
 wages like never before and tpg tpg the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.559
 first two months after nothing we have 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.840
 tried to find an arrangement to 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.469
 amicably at first but it 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.450
 did not work out 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.700
 I started going out that here it is 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.739
 was not going to get paid and if I 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.680
 not to judge but I do not take a 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.000
 lawyer I would not have been paid so 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.190
 at first I won the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.820
 to do at the cost of a group bep has nothing 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.129
 wanted to know 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.260
 so they decided it's reminiscent of 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.420
 go to public court and the decision 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.920
 was again favorable to the court of appeal 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.270
 I want one case too had a 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.100
 group and in particular to brahim asloum 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.540
 since he is the president 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.430
 I know what we use to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.290
 gecina constraints so I respected the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.689
 contract so reverse had to comply 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.640
 his contract and to other athletes the 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.439
 boxing she dismissed them edf who are 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.299
 no pressure back and I had 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.159
 other venues of the Olympics 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.659
 after that I'm young I still 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.380
 a career that is before me so I 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.350
 rest motivated 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.040
 after that's sure what made us do that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.040
 did not do us any good 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.540
 on my defeat against the Irishman who 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.220
 not justifiable it hurt me being 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.980
 given that I had gone there for 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.540
 to make a medal so make me fly 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.590
 this win while the count of 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.630
 win it easily 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 it's really an injustice and even 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.840
 outrageous then putting today 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.060
 I have no regrets I have been there and 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.070
 it's all my work I have terrible 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.500
 fight will be redone I would do it again 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.030
 even so I think that if the nba does put 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.640
 not a pressure stroke does not want any 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.050
 judges and that really makes them their priority 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.030
 to give back to the noble art 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.180
 really these values ​​of nobility and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.040
 ordered that in london 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.660
 boxing it was everything but not one 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.430
 was not the noble art and all the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.900
 flights that took and that corruption is 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.900
 inadmissible and scandalous 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.150
 when I told you that I at least 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.250
 have it done so I will be less than 1000 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.140
 in flat then there for the year 2012 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.970
 I will not have to commit so planned for 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.680
 the year 2013 the different 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.530
 alternatives to I can stay as an amateur 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.989
 I can make or wsb or PBC 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.760
 the web the professional boxing but 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.680
 really professional boxing that him 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.510
 will also make the next game 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.930
 what was not the frame is to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.909
 heavens 4th alternative it would be of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.069
 simply go professional 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.230
 so there I have a lot of proposals 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.980
 so being more injured 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.290
 it's not worse 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.819
 me it allows me to back products 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.129
 to really see what I want and what 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.470
 that I want to continue within 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.410
 the nba for really tried next may 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.049
 game jamin second Olympiad and for 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.159
 third but good booster if a 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.860
 third to make a medal 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.540
 bring back a title 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.490
 I sign right now after 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.360
 it's still corruption so 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.710
 I hope that mentalities will change 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.450
 and at the level of the nba they will make a 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.080
 little housekeeping in everything that is a 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.080
 little bit of bad guys 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.049
 I am well supported at the level of my 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.640
 wife and my brother who is behind 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.370
 I have the president of the club too 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.629
 a lot behind me and after the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.939
 city ​​of bagnolet that supports us 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.980
 a lot and it's thanks to them too 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.599
 that I am here that I have not troubled 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.989
 of certain things since they 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.540
 are really behind me for that 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.329
 I'm efficient and he believes at least you 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.500
 give the means I gave thoroughly 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.900
 after as we say payroll 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.260
 so far peace so sure of 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.090
 labyad omar I got this medal 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.760
 but despite that there is not a lot of sports 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.650
 so after my sporting value all the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.510
 the world ordered both 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.170
 coaches that the promoters or 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.760
 coaching the French stadium 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.040
 as I say I can not fight that 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.250
 judges maybe after I can more 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.229
 accept and after as I say after 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.479
 this is not feeling sorry for himself 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.889
 and that's it, it's a sailing thing to 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.070
 all plated then good as I'm not 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.630
 like this here I go attractions we go 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.100
 to say I look at mom I look ahead 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.370
 and as we say we must not look at our 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.370
 Visa
