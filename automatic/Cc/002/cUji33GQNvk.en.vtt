00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
show are going to be black dice when

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.040 
show are going to be black dice when
that<00:02:52.319> happens<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.340> take<00:02:53.640> all<00:02:53.849> seven<00:02:54.599> dice<00:02:54.810> at

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that happens you take all seven dice at

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.530 
that happens you take all seven dice at
this<00:02:55.170> point<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:56.250> roll<00:02:56.550> them<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.030> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
this point and you roll them and you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.149 
this point and you roll them and you
count<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.049> number<00:02:58.349> of<00:02:58.379> arrows<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.099> are

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
count the number of arrows that are

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.640 
count the number of arrows that are
showing<00:02:59.489> on<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.849> black<00:03:00.090> dice<00:03:00.329> only<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.049> you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
showing on the black dice only and you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.790 
showing on the black dice only and you
can<00:03:01.769> see<00:03:01.890> here<00:03:02.129> are

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
can see here are

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.720 
can see here are
so<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.730> Train<00:03:04.060> moves<00:03:04.690> three<00:03:05.140> spots<00:03:05.470> one<00:03:06.280> two

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
so the Train moves three spots one two

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.920 
so the Train moves three spots one two
three<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.890> train<00:03:09.220> hits<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:10.060> rabbit<00:03:10.540> doesn't

three if the train hits a rabbit doesn't

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.900 
three if the train hits a rabbit doesn't
actually<00:03:11.200> hit<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.530> rabbit<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.400> rabbit<00:03:12.550> fleas

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
actually hit the rabbit the rabbit fleas

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.870 
actually hit the rabbit the rabbit fleas
and<00:03:13.090> terror<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.510> goes<00:03:14.080> back<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.440> its<00:03:14.470> owner

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
and terror and goes back to its owner

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.360 
and terror and goes back to its owner
then<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.480> other<00:03:16.690> players<00:03:17.110> who<00:03:17.650> were<00:03:17.890> not<00:03:18.100> hit

then the other players who were not hit

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
then the other players who were not hit
by<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.610> train<00:03:18.970> are<00:03:19.420> going<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:20.020> carrots

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
equal to the spot there on so the green

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.160 
equal to the spot there on so the green
and<00:03:22.810> red<00:03:23.590> rabbit<00:03:24.310> would<00:03:24.430> get<00:03:24.670> two<00:03:24.910> carrots<00:03:25.360> the

and red rabbit would get two carrots the
blue<00:03:26.440> rabbit<00:03:26.740> down<00:03:27.130> here<00:03:27.550> would<00:03:27.970> get<00:03:28.180> three

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
a lot of choices really when you roll

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.190 
a lot of choices really when you roll
the<00:04:42.910> dice<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.120> can<00:04:43.419> move<00:04:43.570> one<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.990> four

different<00:04:44.490> rabbits<00:04:45.490> maybe<00:04:45.730> sometimes<00:04:46.450> you

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
different rabbits maybe sometimes you

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.420 
different rabbits maybe sometimes you
don't<00:04:46.720> roll<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:46.990> certain<00:04:47.290> color<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:48.250> then<00:04:48.370> you

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
don't roll a certain color but then you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.950 
don't roll a certain color but then you
decide<00:04:48.790> which<00:04:48.940> one<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.150> move<00:04:49.419> you<00:04:49.810> don't

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
decide which one to move you don't

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.510 
decide which one to move you don't
always<00:04:50.200> want<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.500> move<00:04:50.650> yourself<00:04:51.160> because

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
always want to move yourself because

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.680 
always want to move yourself because
sometimes<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:51.970> put<00:04:52.120> yourself<00:04:52.419> in<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.600> bad

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
sometimes you put yourself in a bad

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.659 
sometimes you put yourself in a bad
position<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:54.010> also<00:04:54.160> have<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.400> kind<00:04:54.610> of

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
position and you also have to kind of

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.220 
position and you also have to kind of
guess<00:04:54.940> how<00:04:55.150> far<00:04:55.419> that<00:04:55.570> train<00:04:55.930> is<00:04:56.050> going<00:04:56.140> to

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
guess how far that train is going to

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.840 
guess how far that train is going to
move<00:04:56.290> probably<00:04:57.160> it's<00:04:57.280> going<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.460> move<00:04:57.610> between

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
move probably it's going to move between

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.750 
move probably it's going to move between
two<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:58.660> four<00:04:58.960> spaces<00:04:59.460> but<00:05:00.460> you're<00:05:00.640> never

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
two and four spaces but you're never

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.850 
two and four spaces but you're never
sure<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.240> can<00:05:01.390> move<00:05:01.510> really<00:05:01.660> far<00:05:01.990> sometimes<00:05:02.710> it

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
sure it can move really far sometimes it

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.620 
sure it can move really far sometimes it
did<00:05:02.980> right<00:05:03.220> yeah<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.000> sometimes<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.480> didn't

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
did right yeah and sometimes it didn't

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.090 
did right yeah and sometimes it didn't
move<00:05:04.690> at<00:05:04.840> all<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.650> can<00:05:05.770> sit<00:05:05.919> right<00:05:05.980> in

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
move at all so you can sit right in

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.860 
move at all so you can sit right in
front<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.730> you<00:05:07.419> want<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.660> three

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
front of it and you want the three

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.780 
front of it and you want the three
carats<00:05:08.169> eight<00:05:08.620> carats<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> little<00:05:09.460> longer

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
carats eight carats is a little longer

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.370 
carats eight carats is a little longer
than<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.120> like<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.450> game<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.720> be<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:10.870> think<00:05:10.990> six

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
than I like the game to be I think six

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.890 
than I like the game to be I think six
carats<00:05:11.710> might<00:05:11.830> work<00:05:12.010> better<00:05:12.280> but<00:05:12.880> it<00:05:13.660> works

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
carats might work better but it works

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.270 
carats might work better but it works
pretty<00:05:14.050> good<00:05:14.169> it's<00:05:14.380> cute<00:05:14.650> easy<00:05:14.890> to<00:05:15.130> set<00:05:15.250> up

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
pretty good it's cute easy to set up

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.890
