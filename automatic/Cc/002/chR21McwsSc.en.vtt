00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello how about the captors like all 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.580
 on Mondays in fact this is the first 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.220
 Monday but like the following 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 Monday I bring you the top 5 skins the top 5 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.019
 skins and this time we go with one that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.250
 you said and it's dragon ball z like that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.470
 let's start and remember if you 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
 you want a top 5 skins of some 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
 series some show or some videogame 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 some book some what has been commented 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.859
 and if you see one that I like, I'll do it like that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.019
 let's start, I remind you that the five 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.699
 skins do not go more important because 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 in that case the first place would be goku 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.000
 if they do not go which is better which one is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.800
 better created which is therefore justly 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.840
 that which is better created which have 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.469
 best pixels play with colors 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.710
 so let's start number 5 and in the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.020
 place number 5 we have this character 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.550
 how good was one color and a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.770
 bag here and changed it to a color 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.860
 purple which was stupid more 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.000
 big saying that it looks like it looked 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.399
 originally an African-American to a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 black and the truth is that I never saw it 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 that way in fact I never never 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.760
 I imagined that people would see it as a 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.240
 african but good is mister popo who 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240
 he does not know him 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.580
 good in my case if we had friends 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.740
 which are very dark skin almost black and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.060
 we tell you mister little in fine what is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.159
 also the power that I liked the most is that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.869
 is recognizable towards then later when 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.130
 You see, you recognize that it's our little 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.090
 Also look at those sexy lips and lips 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 says that I realized that I had eyes 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.399
 I thought that the eyes are the black I say what 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.730
 white good here is mister little in the 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.440
 position number 5 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.640
 number 4 we take it with the position 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.230
 number 2 to this staff that at 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.530
 beginning was bad then it did good 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.530
 rather 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 that part I never understood that it was bad 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 and it became good or it was bad and at 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 destroy it a new person of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.450
 he the good colleague I never know what 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.049
 I understood what he says is that good 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.360
 is a person of serious character 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:07.350
 embittered but affection and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.780
 itching and cordoba that is peak what in 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.780
 Spanish was placed on the network good because 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.790
 it's because I chose it as number 4 because 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.330
 it's recognizable, just see what you see 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.550
 you say itch oy and that 's it and I liked it 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.920
 how are your little antennas I liked it a lot 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.960
 it lacks the good turban is that it is 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.460
 in his fight mode truth but still I 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.310
 I really liked how they play 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.680
 with the pixels so well this is the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.600
 position number 4 number 3 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.400
 we go with the number 3 position of dragon 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.040
 ball z the top 5 of skins that I can 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.870
 find in what I rely on the way 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.460
 which is designed on how it looks like jan 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.650
 with pixels not just in what 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.260
 most important character but how is 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.850
 created the skin and we're going with this position 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.000
 number 3 which a curious fact in 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.570
 make you had a mustache and the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.250
 fans did not like it and then the daughter of 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.530
 akira or the creator I think it's called 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.210
 kieran I'm not sure good your daughter's 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.510
 creator told him he did not like that 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.050
 I had a mustache and that's why I summarized it and 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.040
 good 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.020
 It's Mr. Vegueta with his uniform 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.480
 warriors and someone who according to is very 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.480
 mighty but then it sucks 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.070
 because they always destroy it but everything 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.520
 I liked it I loved the color as it is a 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.830
 color something dark I loved the radar I 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.480
 loved the radar I loved it just 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.850
 that's why I chose the radar I loved the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.060
 radar how is it is that it is great the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.440
 radar and let's see the back 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.230
 look at this is that it's great as 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.000
 they combine the medium dark colors and 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.610
 Well, I'm saying what it took 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.050
 of the radar is just great I'm in 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.790
 the number 2 post to see do not get angry no 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.230
 they are like vaginas of schoolgirls 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.230
 This is position number 2 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.060
 is that if I say anything they will know 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.830
 Who is Mr. Goku? That's how we are. 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.000
 with Mr. Goku the father of all the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.120
 best of all 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.600
 the creator the killer the fighter is more 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.730
 strong if I say that this is against him he has not 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.680
 put against him you're stupid is 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.690
 true simply because you can 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.760
 confuse one thinks that is what one 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.160
 you may think that it is ccoo jaÃ©n already of 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.380
 big even at night can be 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.780
 confuse so good here is I do that 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.970
 I loved it in the singing that they put it with 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.380
 the combat suit and well let's see 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.910
 how it looks from behind 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.010
 look what I liked was the hair 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.930
 also the version there is someone who is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.910
 exactly the same thing but 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.660
 obviously with golden hair so 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.870
 good 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.720
 goku number 2 then who is the place 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.200
 number one 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.570
 but not always more and we go with the 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.820
 position number 1 the coveted number one 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.000
 1 what would they say if I did not fire who the fuck 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.970
 it was a good thing I chose it because 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.380
 it is recognized at the first instant number 2 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:06.470
 the face is epic and faces of laughter with the 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.040
 ok face to see 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.570
 some little things about him and he has 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.340
 several versions version bad version 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.140
 good is transformed into things you can 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.750
 divide in things he was the enemy more 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.040
 difficult for my taste the most difficult the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.600
 best enemy has several 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.990
 transformations can absorb people 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.900
 as good what I already said too much and he 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.380
 is 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.880
 ma jin wook but in its fat version or 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.330
 be the first version in which after 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.330
 you look 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.610

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.620
 the face protrudes making it travel 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.720
 It seems that the chubby loved me 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.169
 loved it for the fucking face I loved it for 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.099
 the face was the only thing I liked and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:11.740
 there are better ones with 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:14.319
 talking about playing with the pixels that 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.199
 the tone is better but none with a 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.210
