00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.579
 for most children, the bicycle is the first means of transport 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.049
 guidance with this is very important because that is how you do it 

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:24.029
 children experience in traffic 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.079
 teach them how to handle dangerous situations 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.060
 ref 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.810
 as long as the children are not good enough even to ride a bike 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.170
 steal thus for which bicycle taxi a representative all kinds of different 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.500
 ways adapted to age 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 but for a damper 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.320
 just being burgled at home 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.200
 for him and are welcome 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.860
 can just do that rpl fm 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.490
 the 29 year old actress and when you get there I won't fall again 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.860
 this is too long 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.320
 he stops 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.539
 one of the suspects 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.650
 it is no longer under guardianship 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.750
 and i feel like a friend a real store the room 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.150
 because that goes very far 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510
 very strange 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.780
 10 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.450
 The studies have shown that children are around 3 years of age 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.200
 be able to cycle a ribbon 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 naturally, experience and maturity gained during the weekend play an important role 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.140
 role 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.040
 the number of industrial accidents with a beautiful shot 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 comes around Saturday morning 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.340
 tomorrow I look forward to being the easiest and safest way 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.080
 nadal continues to belong alongside storylines and boldly the black rat on the two 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.120
 girls 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.440
 I stay there too early to finally be a kind of buffer for the car 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.710
 arrest 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 it is important to assess the situation correctly 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.130
 especially if you like the street 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.030
 designated to wear already at the first 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.420
 sprinkle if necessary 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820
 therefore the name 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.820
 gray and that applies to both intersections 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.529
 we are going to stop for a while 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.569
 let's see what the situation is 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.329
 as overlooked 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.329
 after two defeats 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.969
 that has his left shoe 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.459
 they are out of the way 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.010
 children respond slower than adults 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.820
 take therefore the coming time and what your child does not recognize the situation 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.339
 turn left onto the road 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.739
 is from now on the first night is under the control of others 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.879
 he said it wasn't 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.879
 then raise your hand 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.919
 of the world 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.709
 after a while you can drive a little further 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.310
 and your child I almost want to pass the hour with 7 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.399
 very well 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.589
 how the last bit 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:05.879
 it's like being alone for it 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.879
 but if I say stop, stop 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.219
 after the cycle route together a few times 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.639
 you can decide whether your child is ready or not can only send it on the road 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.709
 he says 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.779
 9 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.779
 a little kuranyi 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.639
 Friday afternoon 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.089
 stealing the bike indispensable in the 20 dead investigations can speak 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.199
 of a breakthrough of the investigation thus a spokesperson 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.709
 has shown that the risk of brain injury spotting stepmother decreases 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.009
 and how different 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.819
 this concerns both the airport of the fund and hit him in the event of a collision 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.489
 at Schiphol it is obvious that we are going to contact his renault bolide cyclist 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.559
 Everything a priest who can provide the answer is sufficient 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:58.959
 to be replaced 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.439
 Another aspect that is that the Zaanstreek must sufficiently protect the 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.689
 Regulation has so far-reaching expectations about the 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.999
 slapstick such that it is sufficiently protected 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.269
 and the last aspect is that there must be a good season firmly on the head 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.870
 in view of the smit jenny smit site, our research has shown that 

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:19.199
 Poach them under the trust to win the head and be the most harmful 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.189
 are for the staff so if the ball is not properly secured and the bike falls 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.830
 then the band moss can come and that rotary motion actually makes it worse 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.719
 there are well must be well confirmed 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:34.210
 children learn through timmy there tip you always to set the right example 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.330
 respect the road code put a bike all over and wear a fluorescent mitt 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.830
 to see is not the same as it is in order 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.810
 For more information, consult the various injuries of GDP and 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.050
 Familiarize your children with the traffic as soon as possible
