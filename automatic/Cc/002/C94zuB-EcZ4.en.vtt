00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:09.452
 I really do not understand, if you could not stop the guy in the high hat first ... 

00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:12.841
 How did Clara jump to your present time, and suddenly set the problem? 

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:13.708
 Yes really. 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.573
 It just worked out, I do not know, she's the impossible girl. 

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:20.440
 So you two just sit here, every day, how do you not get bored? 

00:00:20.557 --> 00:00:22.172
 So what are you doing here, Mr. Doctor? 

00:00:22.173 --> 00:00:26.061
 Well, being the master of time I saved entire planets over and over again, 

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:28.781
 I'm technically a superhero of the universe. 

00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:33.604
 So I thought to take a little break, jump to visit, and say no for what, gentlemen. 

00:00:33.707 --> 00:00:34.862
 Are you saving planets? 

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:36.509
 All the time. Yes. 

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:39.070
 My star exploded, so what's the deal? 

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:44.673
 Oh yes. Krypton. Sorry, a fixed moment in time, I could not intervene. 

00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:46.376
 It's very complicated to explain. 

00:00:47.142 --> 00:00:49.385
 comfortable. -Yes, yes indeed. 

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:52.151
 Just like your accessories belt. 

00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:53.099
 as they say. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.265
 Just like your magic wand. 

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:57.279
 It's not magic, it's a voice screwdriver. And I'm sure you'd want one. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.988
 No, I have a batty screwdriver. 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.689
 What would a bat do with a voice screwdriver? 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.574
 You could save Rory and Amy! 

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:04.941
 What ... they lived happily ever after. 

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:06.408
 You abandoned them in America. 

00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:07.721
 Is he always like that? 

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:09.558
 Amy! 

00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:12.136
 I'd come back for you! 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.419
 Because I'm Batman! 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.226
 Sorry, it is full of passion ... 

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:17.113
 It's so worth it. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.414
 Attractive companies. Yes. Another super heroes item for comparison. 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.550
 As I said, there is nothing for it. 

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:24.607
 So what after that, Doctor? 

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:28.767
 I do not know, as usual, I guess. Always running away, always a lifeguard. 

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:30.329
 I'll probably have a new body soon. 

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.216
 A period of great change, to tell the truth. 

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:35.061
 Well tell us if you need help with Dalek or something. 

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:37.377
 I do not think it will be necessary. 

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:38.082
 Why not? 

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:40.167
 You see, it's hard to break Dalk's neck, 

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:41.942
 Because they do not have a neck, for starters. 

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:43.577
 Or ... break. 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.557
 More like, no ... break. 

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:47.291
 See what I did there? 

00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:48.554
 Not bad, Mr. Doctor. 

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:50.195
 You'll never let it go, will you? 

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:54.647
 No, seriously, come back and save Amy. 

00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:57.471
 -Coffee shop: Oh Hero- 

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:03.746
 Hey, wanna know the secret identity of ... 

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:06.393
 No! No, how did you get in here anyway? 

00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:07.736
 Because I'm Batman! 

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:17.420
 Thank you for watching!
