00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.130
 Well I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.470
 how to prepare a trap to kill and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.600
 drive away anise challenge 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.570
 I say mice because I do not know if it will work 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.130
 for rats but I know that for mice if 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 works 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.210
 we need two things 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.140
 or three things better and more novel but 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.150
 Tunisia is like a kind of glue 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.150
 where the mice are stuck 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 come and not industrial 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.960
 or agricultural 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.960
 for Japanese 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.770
 or rodents 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.250
 and a piece of cardboard 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:57.440
 piece of paper 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.440
 the magazine sheet for you with the step 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.430
 we take the glue 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:11.020
 so that it covers the entire surface 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.020
 of the cardboard in this case 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.210
 I want to remind you that this rubber is not 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.200
 poisonous 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.360
 she is not going to eat is coming 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.450
 for the only thing that works is having this 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 rubber sword and so they have 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 stuck 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.960
 finally we miss 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.350
 the agricultural poison is very effective 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.960
 it really is very effective 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.540
 you can ask for a supermarket in 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.540
 your city in the country where you are 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.870
 if you want to add cookie crumbs 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.260
 of bread because that 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.729
 although that has very effective because it is 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.880
 very painful about all the cheese is very 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.880
 olorosa 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.600
 and ready 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.630
 and I assure you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.270
 that if they are not killed, it drives them away 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.240
 effective above all to guide them 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.390
 because we have already verified that the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.550
 mice are very smart and fall to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.720
 one or two but the rest of us do not fit 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.550
 will fall then if placed several 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.070
 traps of these in strategic locations 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.990
 sure they will not go through there anymore and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.140
 they will end and end up leaving you 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.140
 home
