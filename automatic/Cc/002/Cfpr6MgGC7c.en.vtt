00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 to defend from the ca 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.140
 The next one for that does not exist 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.520
 luisa builds the umpire and that 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.290
 is incredible 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.809
 So friends I have something like that in life 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.430
 not seen yet that was a real one 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.699
 strike against the referee 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.530
 and that will be for luisa about this 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.290
 festspiel out have follow 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.820
 an embarrassing unsportsmanlike 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.769
 occurs from luisao 31 years of playing 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:00.879
 his ninth season and that goes too far 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:05.140
 that is incredibly guilty 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.970
 behave like the portuguese on this 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.090
 ship have responded but then 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.479
 on top of that luisao against the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.479
 referee 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 So that's a blow against the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:26.890
 upper body and that is for luisa 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.050
 So massive consequences have it now 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:35.140
 the red card is not one 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:38.140
 big surprise and referee 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.700
 Christian Fischer seems to be playing the game 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.700
 to end provisionally 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.180
 for when he hurt me in the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.220
 location good play is to continue as 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.009
 So we are back in DÃ¼sseldorf 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.330
 Game ends everyone sooner and later 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.920
 we see pictures that are anything but 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:05.149
 normal, therefore, i think christian 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.149
 fischer wanted 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.590
 give garcia the yellow red card and 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.870
 That's why the Portuguese got into trouble 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.450
 but already in a frame where you look 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.400
 people have to say this is it please 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.510
 Not 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.819
 norbert meier 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.439
 clearly one thinks then of this picture the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.379
 have sometimes gone through the nerves 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.450
 against albert quarrels so purely theoretically 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.230
 It may happen to you but it may 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 not happen 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.450
 this attack is from luisao 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.150
 indiscreet bottom drawer 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.709
 and I bet that will follow for him 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.709
 also have in the compulsory school
