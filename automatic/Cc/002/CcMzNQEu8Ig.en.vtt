it's like super hydrolyzed protein

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:09.620 
it's like super hydrolyzed protein
without<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.519> taste<00:01:05.790> literally<00:01:06.790> it's<00:01:07.180> like

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.850 

they<00:01:10.630> actually<00:01:10.750> is<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.080> complex<00:01:11.470> blend<00:01:11.650> of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
they actually is a complex blend of

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.219 
they actually is a complex blend of
pharmaceutical<00:01:12.670> aminos<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.630> it's<00:01:13.930> actually

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
pharmaceutical aminos so it's actually

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.510 
pharmaceutical aminos so it's actually
utilized<00:01:14.740> by<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:14.890> body<00:01:15.100> one<00:01:15.280> hundred<00:01:15.490> percent

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
utilized by a body one hundred percent

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.420 
utilized by a body one hundred percent
whereas<00:01:16.060> wave

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
whereas wave

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.389 
whereas wave
so<00:01:18.430> it's<00:01:19.090> not<00:01:19.270> really<00:01:19.329> a<00:01:19.750> protein<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.280> it

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
so it's not really a protein but it

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.969 
so it's not really a protein but it
affects<00:01:21.850> like<00:01:22.090> protein<00:01:24.420> 60<00:01:25.420> servings<00:01:26.670> yeah

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
affects like protein 60 servings yeah

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.719 
affects like protein 60 servings yeah
well<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.100> equivalent<00:01:30.490> be<00:01:30.549> about<00:01:30.729> 25<00:01:31.060> grams

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
well the equivalent be about 25 grams

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.550 
well the equivalent be about 25 grams
only<00:01:33.729> five<00:01:33.880> calories<00:01:34.210> right<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:35.320> doesn't
