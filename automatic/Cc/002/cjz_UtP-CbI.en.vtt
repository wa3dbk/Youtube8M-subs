00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
before I paint that but I'm like you can

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
see it is a bit darker so I might have

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.760 
see it is a bit darker so I might have
to<00:01:50.470> lighten<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.979> up<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.869> little<00:01:53.380> bit<00:01:53.619> of

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
to lighten that up with a little bit of

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.730 
to lighten that up with a little bit of
white<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.720> difference<00:01:56.140> there

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
white you can see the difference there

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.020 
white you can see the difference there
the<00:01:57.369> original<00:01:57.970> against<00:01:58.539> didn't<00:01:59.349> you<00:02:00.030> but

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
the original against didn't you but

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.699 
the original against didn't you but
overall<00:02:01.569> good<00:02:02.259> coverage<00:02:02.799> on<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:04.439> scuffs<00:02:05.439> and

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
overall good coverage on the scuffs and

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.640 
overall good coverage on the scuffs and
that<00:02:05.830> looks<00:02:06.159> way<00:02:06.789> better<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:10.230> might<00:02:11.230> just<00:02:11.410> put<00:02:11.470> a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
that looks way better I might just put a

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.009 
that looks way better I might just put a
bit<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.040> finish<00:02:12.370> on<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.610> when<00:02:12.819> I'm<00:02:12.910> done

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.009 

here's<00:02:17.019> both<00:02:17.290> shoes<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.980> finish<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
here's both shoes to finish and the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.490 
here's both shoes to finish and the
paint<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.190> infrared<00:02:21.730> part<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.329> not<00:02:23.049> quite

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
paint on the infrared part is not quite

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.890 
paint on the infrared part is not quite
an<00:02:23.680> exact<00:02:24.130> match<00:02:24.400> even<00:02:24.819> though<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.150> added<00:02:25.660> white

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
an exact match even though I added white

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.660 
an exact match even though I added white
so<00:02:26.349> just<00:02:26.590> keep<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:26.980> mind

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
so just keep that in mind

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.840 
so just keep that in mind
maybe<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.209> infra<00:02:28.630> red<00:02:28.859> 2014<00:02:29.859> color<00:02:30.549> would<00:02:30.819> be

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
maybe the infra red 2014 color would be

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.229 
maybe the infra red 2014 color would be
better<00:02:32.310> overall<00:02:33.310> I'm<00:02:33.609> happy<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.090> the

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
better overall I'm happy with the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.880 
better overall I'm happy with the
