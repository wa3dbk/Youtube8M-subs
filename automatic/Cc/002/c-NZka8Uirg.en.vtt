00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
index finger kind of bars across and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
index finger kind of bars across and
then<00:00:30.150> he<00:00:30.240> brings<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.859> two<00:00:31.859> notes<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
then he brings on two notes in the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.270 
then he brings on two notes in the
strings<00:00:32.730> four<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.329> two<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.469> case<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
strings four and two in this case if it

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
strings four and two in this case if it
was<00:00:35.430> down<00:00:35.579> low<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.300> frets<00:00:36.660> four<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
was down low it be just frets four and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.160 
was down low it be just frets four and
three<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.059> makes<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.420> D<00:00:39.660> over<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
three and this actually makes a D over a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.479 
three and this actually makes a D over a
chord<00:00:40.680> now<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:40.980> you're<00:00:41.100> getting<00:00:41.190> really

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
chord now if you're getting really

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.479 
chord now if you're getting really
confused<00:00:41.879> about<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.809> imagine<00:00:43.020> your

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
confused about that if you imagine your

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
confused about that if you imagine your
C<00:00:44.489> shape<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.690> open<00:00:46.110> here

C shape that you would have open here

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.029 
C shape that you would have open here
and<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.010> move<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.520> two<00:00:47.850> frets<00:00:48.890> into<00:00:49.890> your

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and you move that up two frets into your

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
and you move that up two frets into your
bar<00:00:50.250> chord<00:00:50.579> version<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> C<00:00:51.239> shape<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
bar chord version of the C shape and you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.110 
bar chord version of the C shape and you
take<00:00:52.110> off<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.530> finger<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.760> drop

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
today so we're going to doing this up an

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.260 
today so we're going to doing this up an
octave<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> D<00:01:11.220> /<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
octave we do this one here the D / a and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.219 
octave we do this one here the D / a and
then<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.450> moved<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> around<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.170> two

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
then I've moved it around in two

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.480 
then I've moved it around in two
different<00:01:13.380> positions<00:01:13.619> he<00:01:13.979> doesn't<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
different positions he doesn't do this a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.039 
different positions he doesn't do this a
lot<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> wanted<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> make<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:15.900> fun

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
lot but I wanted to make it a little fun

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:16.850 
lot but I wanted to make it a little fun
example<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
example for you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.289 
example for you
we're<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.720> /<00:01:19.229> E<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.250> G<00:01:20.729> /<00:01:21.090> D

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
we're then going into a / E and a G / D

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.880 
we're then going into a / E and a G / D
and<00:01:21.630> then<00:01:21.900> we've<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.500> little<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and then we've got a kind of little a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.219 
and then we've got a kind of little a
major<00:01:23.220> pentatonic<00:01:23.759> lick<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.630> finish<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> one

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
major pentatonic lick to finish this one

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
major pentatonic lick to finish this one
up<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.560> let's<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.640> one

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
up so let's have a look at that one

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:54.740 
up so let's have a look at that one
start<00:01:27.659> slowly<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.110> always<00:01:28.409> build<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.829> up

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.940 

example<00:01:55.750> two<00:01:55.870> revolves<00:01:56.230> around<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.560> technique

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
example two revolves around a technique

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.730 
example two revolves around a technique
today<00:01:57.610> I'm<00:01:57.730> gonna<00:01:57.910> call<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.270> technique

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
today I'm gonna call the technique

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.220 
today I'm gonna call the technique

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.460 
does this extremely well and what I've
built<00:02:04.000> here<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.390> little<00:02:04.630> run<00:02:04.900> up<00:02:05.080> it's<00:02:05.350> kind

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
built here is a little run up it's kind

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.800 
built here is a little run up it's kind
of<00:02:05.590> like<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> dildey<00:02:06.370> run<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.060> you'll<00:02:07.510> see

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
of like a dildey run up and you'll see

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.750 
of like a dildey run up and you'll see
when<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.110> played<00:02:08.350> through<00:02:08.740> this<00:02:08.890> he<00:02:09.100> runs<00:02:09.580> a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
when you played through this he runs a

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.210 
when you played through this he runs a
series<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.119> notes<00:02:10.390> then<00:02:11.020> starts<00:02:11.470> from<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.740> the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
series of notes then starts from the the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.160 
series of notes then starts from the the
second<00:02:12.640> note<00:02:12.790> he<00:02:13.000> started<00:02:13.420> off<00:02:13.510> runs<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.990> same

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
second note he started off runs the same

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.410 
second note he started off runs the same
series<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.500> notes<00:02:14.770> again<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.160> adds<00:02:15.940> him<00:02:16.210> one

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
series of notes again but adds him one

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.000 
series of notes again but adds him one
more<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:16.870> case<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.290> bend<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:17.710> kind<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
more in this case of bend it's kind of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.950 
more in this case of bend it's kind of
got<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> slight<00:02:18.490> pinch<00:02:18.820> harmonic<00:02:19.360> too<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:19.720> dig

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
got a slight pinch harmonic too so dig

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.410 
got a slight pinch harmonic too so dig
the<00:02:20.170> underside<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.710> your<00:02:21.010> thumb<00:02:21.400> under<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
the underside of your thumb under the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
the underside of your thumb under the
string<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.050> get<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.320> pinch<00:02:23.560> time<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.040> and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
string to get that pinch time on it and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.540 
string to get that pinch time on it and
then<00:02:24.520> he<00:02:24.580> runs<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.000> down<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.420> his<00:02:25.630> signature

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
then he runs it down with his signature

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.430 
then he runs it down with his signature
trademark<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:28.060> hammer-ons<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.720> pull-offs<00:02:28.810> so

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
trademark of hammer-ons and pull-offs so

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.720 
trademark of hammer-ons and pull-offs so
you<00:02:29.530> can<00:02:29.650> also<00:02:29.830> bring<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.160> out<00:02:30.460> of<00:02:30.580> this

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
you can also bring that out of this

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.520 
you can also bring that out of this
technique<00:02:31.120> here<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.140> resolved

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
technique here and then I just resolved

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.560 
technique here and then I just resolved
it<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.770> root<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.280> deep<00:02:33.520> at<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
it to a root and I have deep at the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.990 
it to a root and I have deep at the
twelfth<00:02:35.050> fret<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.530> fourth<00:02:36.400> string<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.970> D

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
twelfth fret of the fourth string the D

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.120 
twelfth fret of the fourth string the D
string<00:02:37.420> there<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.470> little<00:02:38.740> fun<00:02:38.950> one

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
string there so this is a little fun one

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.949 
string there so this is a little fun one
so<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.340> technique<00:02:39.700> really<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.180> try<00:02:40.690> running

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
so the technique really is try running

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.600 
so the technique really is try running
wherever<00:02:41.380> you've<00:02:41.470> got<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> scale<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.130> series<00:02:42.580> of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
wherever you've got a scale a series of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.790 
wherever you've got a scale a series of
notes<00:02:42.940> start<00:02:43.570> from<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> second<00:02:44.230> one<00:02:44.350> go<00:02:44.530> up<00:02:44.650> to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
notes start from the second one go up to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.350 
notes start from the second one go up to
the<00:02:44.890> next<00:02:45.040> note<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.520> scale<00:02:45.610> then<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.150> can

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the next note of the scale then you can

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
the next note of the scale then you can
carry<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.780> from<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.050> third<00:02:47.290> etc<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.980> run

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
carry on from the third etc and run

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.100 
carry on from the third etc and run
backwards<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.850> well<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.480> quite<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> fun<00:02:49.930> way

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
backwards as well it's quite a fun way

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.960 
backwards as well it's quite a fun way
of<00:02:50.140> maximizing<00:02:50.950> your<00:02:51.250> scales<00:02:51.580> let's<00:02:51.850> have<00:02:51.940> a

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
of maximizing your scales let's have a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:25.590 
of maximizing your scales let's have a
look<00:02:52.120> at<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.270> link<00:02:52.450> too

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.980 

mmm<00:03:26.950> lick<00:03:27.950> 3ish<00:03:28.340> or<00:03:28.520> lick<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.180> style<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.600> so

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
mmm lick 3ish or lick in the style of so

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.780 
mmm lick 3ish or lick in the style of so
I've<00:03:30.110> kind<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.440> tried<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.010> create<00:03:31.400> something

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
I've kind of tried to create something

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.330 
I've kind of tried to create something
here<00:03:31.820> that's<00:03:32.150> quite<00:03:32.270> fun<00:03:32.630> quite<00:03:33.020> jam<00:03:34.010> packed

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
here that's quite fun quite jam packed

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.000 
here that's quite fun quite jam packed
full<00:03:34.580> with<00:03:34.640> techniques<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.500> often<00:03:36.500> one<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:36.950> my

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
full with techniques I often one of my

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.410 
full with techniques I often one of my
most<00:03:37.190> asked<00:03:37.400> questions<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:37.970> how<00:03:38.150> do<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.330> get

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
most asked questions is how do I get

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.990 
most asked questions is how do I get
speed<00:03:38.990> on<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.350> guitar<00:03:39.680> well<00:03:39.950> often<00:03:40.760> players

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
speed on the guitar well often players

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.330 
speed on the guitar well often players
like<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.450> like<00:03:41.930> Satriani<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.010> things<00:03:43.220> like

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
like the like Satriani and things like

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.010 
like the like Satriani and things like
that<00:03:43.520> they're<00:03:43.670> using<00:03:43.820> big<00:03:44.120> lagarto<00:03:44.810> they're

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
that they're using big lagarto they're

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.170 
that they're using big lagarto they're
using<00:03:45.290> tapping<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:45.980> know<00:03:46.100> whatever<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:46.640> guys

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
using tapping you know whatever but guys

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.030 
using tapping you know whatever but guys
like<00:03:47.390> Brian<00:03:47.630> May<00:03:47.959> would<00:03:48.140> get<00:03:48.320> their<00:03:48.500> speed<00:03:48.770> by

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
like Brian May would get their speed by

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.820 
like Brian May would get their speed by
a<00:03:49.070> combination<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:50.590> hammer-ons<00:03:51.590> pull-offs

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
a combination of hammer-ons pull-offs

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.400 
a combination of hammer-ons pull-offs
and<00:03:52.610> slides<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.989> they'd<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.140> doing<00:03:54.350> a

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
and slides so they'd be doing a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.680 
and slides so they'd be doing a
hammer-on<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.770> pull-off<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.370> specific

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
hammer-on and pull-off in a specific

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.960 
hammer-on and pull-off in a specific
scale<00:03:56.690> mainly<00:03:57.350> pentatonic<00:03:58.040> based<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.820> they

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
scale mainly pentatonic based and they

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.670 
scale mainly pentatonic based and they
would<00:03:59.120> slide<00:03:59.420> back<00:03:59.810> into<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.350> different

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
would slide back into a different

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.729 
would slide back into a different
position<00:04:00.860> or<00:04:01.250> up<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:02.270> to<00:04:02.690> get<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.959> speed<00:04:03.260> there

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
position or up to to get the speed there

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.320 
position or up to to get the speed there
as<00:04:03.920> well<00:04:04.100> now<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.430> one<00:04:04.610> combines<00:04:04.970> in<00:04:05.180> some

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
as well now this one combines in some

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.940 
as well now this one combines in some
nice<00:04:05.480> bends<00:04:05.810> as<00:04:06.080> well<00:04:06.260> but<00:04:06.440> what<00:04:06.590> you'll<00:04:06.709> see

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
nice bends as well but what you'll see

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.220 
nice bends as well but what you'll see
is<00:04:07.100> it's<00:04:07.640> mainly<00:04:08.090> around<00:04:08.270> kind<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.600> B<00:04:08.930> minor

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230
