00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 the first thing to do is to go 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.020
 to whisk the eggs with the sugar 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.060
 this is an operation to be done 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.859
 preferably with a whisk with a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.750
 electric whips because the eggs yes 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.560
 must fit very well must 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.480
 then add the salt 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.090
 add the milk 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.790
 also incorporate this well then 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.030
 prepare the flour with the yeast e 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.100
 cinnamon went to sift 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.950
 sieved because why so avoided by 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.680
 let this come to create lumps 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.390
 it's pretty obvious 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.100
 once you have put all the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 flour and the fairy also incorporate him 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.930
 without forcing too much because we don't have to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.780
 disassemble the mixture and then we go to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.149
 prepare apples for lamela choose 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.100
 the quality of apple you prefer 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.260
 if you want it slightly more sour 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 take a big green apple 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.830
 schmidt or whatever 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.460
 concerns the apple choose yours 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.890
 taste 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.830
 if you add a bit of lamela flour 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.040
 it will be more difficult than it settles towards 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.050
 the bottom then add the chocolate 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.780
 can be chocolate or chocolate drops 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.610
 also chopped tablets and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.330
 mix well then take a mold 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.820
 of about 24 cm buttered well where 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.360
 farinate well so you avoid the risk 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.680
 then stick the cake to us 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.830
 all the compound inside is gone 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.780
 in oven already preheated to 200 degrees 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.130
 the cooking will have to be more or less 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 about an hour 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.360
 once the net is pulled out of the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.580
 oven if you want you can dust it off 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.590
 icing sugar and this is the cake is the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.800
 moist but very good cake 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.800
 enjoy your meal
