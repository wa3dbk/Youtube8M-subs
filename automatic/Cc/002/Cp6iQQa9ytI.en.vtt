00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.690
 hey i'm the rocks and i'll show you 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.949
 in this video a little review too 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.100
 my new drumset the bland 8000 that 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.170
 home ddr 1000 until finally everything 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.960
 a normal james also has one 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:29.450
 snare a base unit crashs in the plus 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.750
 and of course the toms the interesting one 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:38.840
 Of course, this is a movie ddr 1000 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.970
 is three basin petz owns and 4 tom 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.700
 pÃ¤tz that was the reason why me 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.700
 I have bought and yes 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.910
 the construction of the vdd 8000 is actually 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.500
 pretty easy 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.850
 you have a detailed 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.860
 manual in which you first the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.200
 This super stable way can build this 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:10.820
 quite a lot has feet and is 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:16.899
 shockproof and of course one more 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.899
 guide me to fix the whole well 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.380
 to the service as 8000 owns one 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.890
 relatively large module that is very 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.630
 many buttons and three times as many 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:41.310
 functions and if you are doing relatively well 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.990
 to deal with that one has approximately in 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 a week like the whole thing 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 works and how to do something 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.330
 can and I want to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.680
 say that is not really easy 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.000
 initially to deal with it so for all 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.580
 who think now I have the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.800
 instructions I did not read 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.890
 I read it and it is very important to me 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.580
 It's hard to come in but me 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:14.690
 I got it now so partially 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.440
 to cope with the operation and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.440
 it like it very much 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.450
 to the sounds one has over 600 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.310
 different sounds between you 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:37.450
 can now select normal drum 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:41.780
 sounds or different sounds and 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 Other also comes to a video 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.140
 from a small demonstration 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.500
 additional to that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.350
 You have the opportunity to the kids too 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.500
 create and you can even with 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.300
 its own name, rename the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.040
 I think the function is really great 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.910
 wine comb a little better out here 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.310
 switch 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.070
 So you do not have to search for that forever 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.520
 child but one reads yes okay that's 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:20.900
 now just background percussion 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.720
 then I have a whole nation sound at nation 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.610
 normal assets and yes you have a lot 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.680
 many possibilities 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.680
 I think that's great 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.830
 for the price of 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.770
 Essens ratio so I think so 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.300
 price performance ratio very good 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:47.350
 It was always around the 550 euro as well 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.150
 Of course, this is the case here 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.910
 without the headphones without the double base 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.910
 without the chair and without the music stands 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.550
 but what you get for your money 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:06.650
 is actually very good 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.990
 So it has everything my own 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.110
 heart desires 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.760
 okay then it's time 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.239
 and if any questions have arisen 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.380
 are or else yesterday pos is yes 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.380
 just below in the comments 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.790
 and yes , here are some pictures 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.030
 and of course the promised one 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.930
 soundcheck video 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.930
 I wish you a lot of fun
