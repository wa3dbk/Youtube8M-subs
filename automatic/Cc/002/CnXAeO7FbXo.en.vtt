separate<00:01:58.110> those<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.850> also<00:02:00.180> fine-tune

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
separate those you can also fine-tune

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.990

spacing so just by pulling that little

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029 
spacing so just by pulling that little

transfer<00:04:37.650> so<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.760> trick<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.570> lot

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
transfer so the trick to this is a lot

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.280

of<00:04:40.290> heat<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.400> lot<00:04:41.639> of<00:04:41.700> pressure<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.780> Michael

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
of heat and a lot of pressure so Michael

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.760
