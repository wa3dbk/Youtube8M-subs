00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.000
 when only economic essential to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.200
 reduce fuel consumption and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.810
 reduce spending on components 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.550
 mechanics and vec several factors 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.590
 influences the operation cost of the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.050
 truck but with simple tips we can 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.610
 optimize the use of this machine 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.320
 saving fuel and reducing 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.330
 wear of some components 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.550
 so today in the engineering series 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.110
 we are going to address the importance of 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.110
 economic condition let's go there 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.440
 before leaving the truck driver must 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.380
 be attentive to some items the first 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.090
 of them is the calibration of tire tires 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.010
 withered creates drag one hour between 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.350
 truck and the ground by increasing the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.810
 fuel and quickly 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.610
 tire of irregular shape already tires very 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.560
 the comfort of the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.990
 truck driver increases wear on parts 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.460
 and put safety at risk due to 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.590
 reduction of adhesion 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.780
 each mother has to calibrate the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.759
 which can be consulted in the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.979
 owner's manual 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.780
 these guidelines for calibration and 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.229
 do not forget to keep the wheels 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.179
 balance and steering alignment 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.130
 another factor with great influence on 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.920
 fuel consumption is the shape of the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.140
 distribution of the load to the load must be 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.869
 distributed evenly over the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.869
 respecting the limit fell by 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.460
 according to the law of the balance this or 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.470
 be given the use of the form of 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.009
 Truck components avoiding 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 displacement of the load in a braking 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.020
 specific products can 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.819
 change the shape of load distribution 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.440
 in case of doubts consult the manufacturer 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.190
 of implements 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.099
 it is important to be aware of how the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.560
 The load protection canvas is attached to the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.510
 loose or poorly placed besides dangerous 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.880
 considerably increases the consumption of 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.160
 due to the greater friction with the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.140
 the way we conduct is fundamental 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.090
 to reduce fuel consumption 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.629
 The first tip starts when you call 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.629
 the way 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.629
 avoid stepping on the accelerator during 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.700
 This is not necessary and increases. 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.049
 fuel consumption is not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.360
 I need to warm up the engine 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.250
 just turn on the vehicle check the marker 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.170
 system pressure since the panel 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.790
 make sure it is full and 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.829
 able to release the student felipe 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.849
 for the first gear and leave only 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.739
 take advantage of the inertia and down to 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.480
 planar if the truck is already in 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.349
 Speed does not have to follow the order 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.329
 in the corner 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.159
 the automated teller system already 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.170
 recognizes the load condition in 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.879
 automatically set 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.620
 better gait for fabric 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.260
 this technique takes advantage of the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.030
 truck and always saves fuel 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
 keep on the way working regime 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.599
 of ideal rotation 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.400
 drivers can also anticipate the 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.829
 gear changes a semi system 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.900
 automatic 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.510
 still on the exchange of never traffic 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.549
 neutral truck or in the thug is illegal 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.379
 dangerous and increases wear on 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.639
 transmission costs 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.129
 not necessary 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.680
 always be aware of panel costumes 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.569
 it indicates by means of colors and numbers the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.609
 correct acceleration range 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.410
 the green belt is a moment in which the 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.840
 engine makes all your touch 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.980
 where is the best performance ratio with 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.199
 lower consumption 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.940
 recommended not to press the 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.099
 accelerator pedal until the end of your 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.260
 because this would be the request of 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.699
 maximum pipe price by increasing the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.129
 fuel consumption 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:55.120
 independent of the range of turns achieved 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.459
 by motor 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.040
 the ideal is whenever possible to combine 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.159
 low throttle focus revs 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.139
 the famous guide on shea still avoid being 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.090
 accelerated acceleration and therefore 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.269
 affects fuel consumption in a way that 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.579
 in the transit situation in the 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.979
 which way the separate meeting places 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.820
 the box in position it through the button 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:20.880
 of the panel and apply the 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.880
 parking 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.180
 this prevents unnecessary wear and tear on the 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:28.979
 unsecured clutch and manual shift the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.020
 vehicle only by the clutch or 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.240
 travel with the hand on the exchange 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.819
 these attitudes deplete the components 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.030
 of the March box that increases consumption 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:41.099
 attention to the position of the feet support them 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.430
 Clutch Pedal Decreases Life 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.680
 usefulness of the pieces of this system 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.919
 also deserves attention. 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.169
 brake or accelerate unnecessarily has 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.449
 the anticipated view of situations 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.250
 if you need to slow down 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.830
 the engine brake on the stage 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.379
 system that works with the butterfly on the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.690
 collector if you need to reduce 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:06.060
 the march even with the 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.430
 reduction of automated actions in box 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.949
 Stage Two The Brake Engine System 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.009
 decompression of the two cabeções 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.779
 combined systems generate 415 horsepower 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.419
 braking and reduces the consumption of 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.279
 fuel in vehicles conditioning 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:24.539
 later the power capacity of 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:26.669
 braking comes to us 178 horses for 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.330
 braking or in case of 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.340
 emergency use the brake pedal is very 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.599
 important to plan the trip well 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.879
 before leaving 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.039
 always check the best way 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.569
 shortest route and the weather forecast 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.520
 for the period of travel 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.310
 this information can be fundamental 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.259
 for safe and economical travel 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.449
 remember also to follow the plan 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.490
 scheduled maintenance for your vehicle 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.560
 they are key to reducing 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.659
 consumption and increase the life of your 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.460
 Winter 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.409
 Another tip is to not rush the excess of 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.360
 speed only brings disadvantages to the 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.520
 truck driver increases fuel consumption 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.529
 fuel leaves the driver more 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.310
 stressful and even increases the chances of 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.839
 an accident 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.810
 the minimum time gain and the 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:11.849
 many disadvantages this was one more 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.650
 engineering helps to define the 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.930
 theme of the next episode with suggestions 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.069
 of our profiles on twitter facebook or 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.839
 on youtube channel 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.839
 Thank you until the next
