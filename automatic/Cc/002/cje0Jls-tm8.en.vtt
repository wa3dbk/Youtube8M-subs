like zaccardo Ambrosini and we're not

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.250 
like zaccardo Ambrosini and we're not
going<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.179> use<00:00:15.210> much<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.809> they're<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.080> high

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
going to use much and they're on high

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.230 
going to use much and they're on high
wages<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.070> good<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> get<00:00:18.029> rid<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
wages so it's just good to get rid of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390 
wages so it's just good to get rid of
them<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.660> even<00:00:19.410> for<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.740> 2<00:00:19.949> million<00:00:20.189> they'll

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
them if even for about 2 million they'll

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
them if even for about 2 million they'll
be<00:00:20.520> good<00:00:20.640> enough<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.750> makes<00:00:21.930> our<00:00:22.080> wage

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
be good enough and that makes our wage

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.660 
be good enough and that makes our wage
budget<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.800> higher<00:00:22.949> because<00:00:23.160> all<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
budget a lot higher because all the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939 
budget a lot higher because all the
players<00:00:23.850> normally<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.390> high<00:00:24.570> wages<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.619> our

it<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.810> most<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.170> my<00:02:16.260> career<00:02:16.320> modes<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.980> set<00:02:17.610> up

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it in most of my career modes and set up

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
it in most of my career modes and set up
a<00:02:17.850> scouting<00:02:18.210> network<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.350> looked<00:02:19.770> through<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
a scouting network so I looked through a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.920 
a scouting network so I looked through a
couple<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.400> there's<00:02:20.640> torsten<00:02:21.330> uttal<00:02:21.750> i

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
couple here there's torsten uttal i

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.290 
couple here there's torsten uttal i
think<00:02:22.140> thats<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.350> say<00:02:22.380> who<00:02:23.250> has<00:02:23.580> three<00:02:24.060> star

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
think thats I say who has three star

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.210 
think thats I say who has three star
experience<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.900> five<00:02:25.050> star<00:02:25.260> judgment<00:02:25.680> don't

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
experience and five star judgment don't

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740 
experience and five star judgment don't
think<00:02:26.430> experience<00:02:26.790> matters<00:02:27.120> too<00:02:27.420> much<00:02:27.570> but

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
think experience matters too much but

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
think experience matters too much but
he's<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> lot<00:02:28.260> cheaper<00:02:28.290> than<00:02:28.650> coder<00:02:29.070> who<00:02:29.580> has

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
he's a lot cheaper than coder who has

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700 
he's a lot cheaper than coder who has
five<00:02:29.970> star<00:02:30.270> experience<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.320> five<00:02:31.470> star

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
five star experience and five star

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.340 
five star experience and five star
judgment<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.790> you'll<00:02:32.970> see<00:02:33.180> what<00:02:33.420> he<00:02:33.570> I'm

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
judgment so you'll see what he I'm

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.900 
judgment so you'll see what he I'm
planning<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:34.980> getting<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> Brazilian

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
nationally unless we get to the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.850 
nationally unless we get to the
semi-finals<00:04:45.750> maybe<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.320> we<00:04:46.590> start<00:04:46.800> playing

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
semi-finals maybe and we start playing

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.800 
semi-finals maybe and we start playing
the<00:04:47.070> harder<00:04:47.340> teams<00:04:47.580> because<00:04:48.000> I'm<00:04:48.389> not<00:04:48.600> really

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
the harder teams because I'm not really

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.330 
the harder teams because I'm not really
bothered<00:04:48.960> about<00:04:49.169> this<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.650> it's<00:04:49.740> wasting<00:04:50.070> 20

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
bothered about this and it's wasting 20

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.189 
bothered about this and it's wasting 20
minutes<00:04:50.639> of<00:04:50.820> time<00:04:51.030> because<00:04:51.570> I'm<00:04:51.840> easily<00:04:52.080> going

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
minutes of time because I'm easily going

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.749 
minutes of time because I'm easily going
to<00:04:52.259> win<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.530> anyway<00:04:52.889> so<00:04:52.949> Pezzini<00:04:53.520> getting

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
to win this anyway so Pezzini getting

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.520 
to win this anyway so Pezzini getting
two<00:04:53.880> goals<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.389> then<00:04:54.840> not<00:04:54.990> really<00:04:55.199> no<00:04:55.350> going

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
two goals and then not really no going

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.779 
two goals and then not really no going
to<00:04:55.620> go<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.770> make<00:04:56.009> it<00:04:56.130> three<00:04:56.310> nil<00:04:56.490> at<00:04:56.580> halftime

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
to go to make it three nil at halftime

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.879 
to go to make it three nil at halftime
so<00:04:57.570> as<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.229> can<00:04:58.350> see<00:04:58.530> here<00:04:58.710> absolutely

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
so as you can see here absolutely

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.730 
so as you can see here absolutely
smashing<00:04:59.520> them<00:04:59.669> so<00:05:00.169> there's<00:05:01.169> no<00:05:01.349> point<00:05:01.560> of

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
smashing them so there's no point of

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.040 
smashing them so there's no point of
playing<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.669> if<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.120> get<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.449> semi-finals<00:05:03.960> I

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
playing so if I get to the semi-finals I

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.510 
playing so if I get to the semi-finals I
will<00:05:04.199> start<00:05:04.470> playing<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.860> because<00:05:05.130> then<00:05:05.370> it'll

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
will start playing it because then it'll

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.370 
will start playing it because then it'll
get<00:05:05.639> interesting<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.330> it'll<00:05:06.930> be<00:05:07.020> really<00:05:07.259> good

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
get interesting and it'll be really good

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.930 
get interesting and it'll be really good
if<00:05:07.560> we<00:05:07.650> can<00:05:07.800> get<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.979> cut<00:05:08.250> this<00:05:08.400> season<00:05:08.789> because

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
if we can get a cut this season because

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.920 
if we can get a cut this season because
I<00:05:09.090> don't<00:05:09.330> think<00:05:09.449> we're<00:05:09.539> going<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.720> win<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
I don't think we're going to win the

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.719 
I don't think we're going to win the
league<00:05:10.080> because<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.949> Ventus<00:05:11.250> have<00:05:11.430> kind<00:05:11.669> of

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
league because you Ventus have kind of

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.999 
league because you Ventus have kind of
run<00:05:11.880> away<00:05:12.120> with<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.479> so<00:05:13.259> into<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.680> game<00:05:13.889> off

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
run away with it so into a game off

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.650 
run away with it so into a game off
against<00:05:14.250> Napoli<00:05:14.729> now<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.270> there's<00:05:15.570> no

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
against Napoli now so there's no

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.600 
against Napoli now so there's no
insignia<00:05:15.990> which<00:05:16.349> is<00:05:16.500> probably<00:05:16.710> their<00:05:16.979> second

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
insignia which is probably their second

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.040 
insignia which is probably their second
threat<00:05:17.910> main<00:05:18.150> threat<00:05:18.449> obviously<00:05:18.630> behind

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
threat main threat obviously behind

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.320 
threat main threat obviously behind
Cavani<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.860> know<00:05:20.250> Hamsik<00:05:20.759> is<00:05:20.880> also<00:05:21.120> quite<00:05:21.240> good

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
Cavani I know Hamsik is also quite good

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.180 
Cavani I know Hamsik is also quite good
but<00:05:22.020> I'll<00:05:22.110> ganser<00:05:22.440> that<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.740> minute<00:05:22.889> so<00:05:23.160> you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
but I'll ganser that in a minute so you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.670 
but I'll ganser that in a minute so you
Ventus<00:05:23.610> as<00:05:23.820> you<00:05:24.000> see<00:05:24.210> there<00:05:24.419> on<00:05:24.599> 32<00:05:25.229> points

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
Ventus as you see there on 32 points

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.310 
Ventus as you see there on 32 points
then<00:05:25.889> let's<00:05:26.130> go<00:05:26.280> Udinese<00:05:26.820> Napoli<00:05:27.750> into<00:05:28.110> then

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
then let's go Udinese Napoli into then

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.770 
then let's go Udinese Napoli into then
we're<00:05:28.500> in<00:05:28.650> 6th<00:05:29.039> still<00:05:29.430> AC<00:05:29.849> Milan<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.570> we've

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
we're in 6th still AC Milan and we've

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.909 
we're in 6th still AC Milan and we've
actually<00:05:30.900> lost<00:05:31.139> a<00:05:31.289> couple<00:05:31.440> of<00:05:31.620> games<00:05:31.650> really

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
actually lost a couple of games really

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.159 
actually lost a couple of games really
so<00:05:32.190> we<00:05:32.310> can't<00:05:32.490> lose<00:05:32.639> many<00:05:32.880> more<00:05:33.150> games<00:05:33.330> or<00:05:33.630> will

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
so we can't lose many more games or will

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.350 
so we can't lose many more games or will
fall<00:05:34.770> behind<00:05:34.919> so<00:05:35.610> us<00:05:35.760> when<00:05:35.970> we<00:05:36.030> look<00:05:36.150> at<00:05:36.240> this

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
fall behind so us when we look at this

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.390 
fall behind so us when we look at this
one<00:05:36.570> so<00:05:36.810> he's<00:05:36.930> pacing<00:05:37.199> everyone<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.130> then

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
one so he's pacing everyone and then

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.770 
one so he's pacing everyone and then
luckily<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.729> quite<00:05:38.940> quick<00:05:39.180> team<00:05:39.389> but<00:05:39.570> look<00:05:39.690> at

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
luckily a quite quick team but look at

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.930 
luckily a quite quick team but look at
this<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.139> then<00:05:40.560> he<00:05:40.620> gets<00:05:40.800> into<00:05:40.949> the<00:05:41.099> box<00:05:41.340> just

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
this and then he gets into the box just

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.490 
this and then he gets into the box just
runs<00:05:42.300> past<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.659> defender<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:43.260> then<00:05:43.380> I'm

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
runs past the defender and then I'm

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.680 
runs past the defender and then I'm
really<00:05:43.830> nice<00:05:44.010> come<00:05:44.310> come<00:05:45.060> finish<00:05:45.270> in<00:05:45.630> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
really nice come come finish in the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.140 
really nice come come finish in the
seventh<00:05:46.289> minute<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.680> make<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:47.010> one<00:05:47.250> nil<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:48.030> we

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
seventh minute to make it one nil so we

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.750 
seventh minute to make it one nil so we
have<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.389> win<00:05:48.510> this<00:05:48.539> game<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:49.139> get<00:05:49.740> near<00:05:50.280> Napoli

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
have to win this game to get near Napoli

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.980 
have to win this game to get near Napoli
because<00:05:51.030> we<00:05:51.150> are<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.300> couple<00:05:51.510> of<00:05:51.630> points<00:05:51.870> behind

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
because we are a couple of points behind

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.870 
because we are a couple of points behind
Napoli<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:52.949> this<00:05:53.130> would<00:05:53.250> be<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.370> really<00:05:53.580> nice

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880
