this<00:00:42.649> interracial<00:00:43.100> bar<00:00:43.489> is<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.850> second<00:00:44.329> part

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
this interracial bar is a second part

this interracial bar is a second part
which<00:00:45.199> is<00:00:45.230> invisible<00:00:45.769> to<00:00:46.309> us<00:00:47.260> we<00:00:48.260> can<00:00:48.409> imagine

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
which is invisible to us we can imagine

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.889 
which is invisible to us we can imagine
it<00:00:48.980> as<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.190> second<00:00:49.789> hunger<00:00:50.120> bar<00:00:50.269> but<00:00:50.780> in

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
it as a second hunger bar but in

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.149 
it as a second hunger bar but in
peaceful<00:00:51.319> and<00:00:52.780> exhaustion<00:00:53.780> bar<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.260> after<00:00:54.800> bar

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
peaceful and exhaustion bar is after bar

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.389 
peaceful and exhaustion bar is after bar
that<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.699> also<00:00:55.999> visible<00:00:56.620> but<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.979> quite

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
that is also visible but is quite

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.939 
that is also visible but is quite
different<00:01:01.239> how<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.569> works<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.170> for

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
different how it works is that for

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.340 
different how it works is that for
example<00:01:04.040> one<00:01:04.970> sometimes<00:01:05.600> when<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:05.960> eat<00:01:06.170> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
example one sometimes when we eat a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.940 
example one sometimes when we eat a
pawnshop<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:07.159> cook<00:01:07.399> /<00:01:07.670> job<00:01:07.969> you<00:01:08.630> will<00:01:09.560> have<00:01:09.799> to

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
pawnshop a cook / job you will have to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.429 
pawnshop a cook / job you will have to
do<00:01:10.070> more<00:01:10.280> things<00:01:10.340> for<00:01:11.060> our<00:01:11.299> hunger<00:01:11.810> bar<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.229> go

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
do more things for our hunger bar to go

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.219 
do more things for our hunger bar to go
down<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:13.369> if<00:01:13.579> we<00:01:13.729> give<00:01:13.909> a<00:01:14.119> simple<00:01:14.750> Apple

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
down that if we give a simple Apple

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.029 
down that if we give a simple Apple
right<00:01:16.070> well<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:18.140> understand<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.829> we<00:01:19.009> are

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
right well to understand that we are

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.600 
right well to understand that we are
going<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.399> do<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> Senate<00:01:20.060> with<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.590> ok<00:01:21.610> every

half<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:37.009> mid-month<00:01:37.549> is<00:01:38.090> equal<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.990> one<00:01:39.259> snap

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
half of a mid-month is equal to one snap

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.179 
half of a mid-month is equal to one snap
and<00:01:40.570> here<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.869> are<00:01:41.930> going<00:01:42.109> to<00:01:42.259> have<00:01:42.500> our<00:01:42.740> hunger

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
and here we are going to have our hunger

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.169 
and here we are going to have our hunger
bar<00:01:43.369> right<00:01:44.060> here<00:01:44.619> ok<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:48.070> every<00:01:49.070> action<00:01:49.310> have

go down well every job takes 0.2

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.540 
go down well every job takes 0.2
exciting<00:02:13.640> part<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.140> means<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:16.160> take<00:02:16.340> out
