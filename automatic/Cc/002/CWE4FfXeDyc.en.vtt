00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.846
It's a hamburger toy.

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.256
It's like a balance game?

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:25.765
Let's open it up

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.112
They hamburgers have eyes! Yay!

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.186
Wow, there's so many faces!

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:39.177
Bread and

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.217
lettuce and

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:43.496
The onions are so cute!

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:44.521
bacon and

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:45.952
(that's ham)

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:46.919
boiled eggs and

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:47.785
tomatoes and

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:50.288
Patties. These are patties, right?

00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:51.389
and cheese

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:54.330
There are 20 cards.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.701
Let's play the Nico Burger Tower Game!

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:02.256
What should I do?

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.895
Stack a patty and a bun!

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:11.899
Stack a lettuce, a patty, a cheese and a bun!

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:12.882
Oh my god!

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:13.925
Put the lettuce down

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:15.762
Is this lettuce?

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:16.553
Yep.

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:19.443
Next is a patty!

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.746
Stack a patty and a bun!

00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:38.875
Stack a bacon, an egg and a bun!	

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:42.760
Ham! Ham!

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:44.460
Egg!

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:51.130
You lose!

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.580
Akira lost!

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:56.230
I didn't lose! The whole thing didn't fall down!

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:05.920
Stack a lettuce, a bacon, a tomato and a bun!

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:07.720

Stack two patties and a bun!

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.760
Which is the patty?

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:28.120
Akira loses! The whole thing fell over.

00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:35.700
Your turn.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.070
I win!

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:52.180
(Kanna wants to try stacking them all)

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:53.420
Only two left!

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:09.980
I was so close…

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:23.190
 First, take three cards, and the person who can make the burgers the fastest is the winner

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:24.230
Ready, start!

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.580
Finished!

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.960
That was a really fun game!

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:37.750
Byebye, come watch us again!

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.000
I wonder what everyone's favorite hamburger is?

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:45.870
I like alllllllll of them!

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:48.400

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.410
