00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.340 

all<00:00:02.669> right<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.600> tutorial<00:00:03.780> what<00:00:04.200> we're

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
all right in this tutorial what we're

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.720 
all right in this tutorial what we're
gonna<00:00:04.440> do<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.799> we're<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.130> use<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
gonna do is we're going to use the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.690 
gonna do is we're going to use the
ladder<00:00:05.970> method<00:00:06.359> or<00:00:06.720> double<00:00:07.080> division<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:08.160> find

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
ladder method or double division to find

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.270 
ladder method or double division to find
the<00:00:09.120> GCF<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:10.730> 24<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.599> 60<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.950> I'm<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the GCF of 24 and 60 so I'm going to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.700 
the GCF of 24 and 60 so I'm going to
start<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.940> those<00:00:15.150> two<00:00:15.210> numbers<00:00:15.980> 24<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.480> 60

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
start with those two numbers 24 and 60

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.689 
start with those two numbers 24 and 60
remember<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.859> we're<00:00:20.010> looking<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.640> are

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
remember what we're looking for here are

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.529 
remember what we're looking for here are
numbers<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.270> divide<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:22.500> both<00:00:22.650> 24<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.880> 60

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
numbers that divide into both 24 and 60

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.450 
numbers that divide into both 24 and 60
or<00:00:24.720> another<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> thinking<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
or another way of thinking about this is

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.599 
or another way of thinking about this is
looking<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.210> factors<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.810> 24<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.680> 60<00:00:29.070> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
looking for factors of 24 and 60 so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.009 
looking for factors of 24 and 60 so
what's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.910> number<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.359> goes<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:30.810> those

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
what's a number that goes into those

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.979 
what's a number that goes into those
well<00:00:31.320> they're<00:00:32.160> both<00:00:32.340> even<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.480> 2

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
well they're both even so I know that 2

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.319 
well they're both even so I know that 2
goes<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.730> 24<00:00:35.730> divided<00:00:36.180> by<00:00:36.270> 2<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.960> 12<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.579> 60

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
goes in 24 divided by 2 is 12 and 60

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.540 
goes in 24 divided by 2 is 12 and 60
divided<00:00:39.750> by<00:00:39.870> 2<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.820> 30<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.899> um<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.649> think

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
divided by 2 is 30 all right um I think

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.369 
divided by 2 is 30 all right um I think
there's<00:00:45.030> still<00:00:45.239> more<00:00:45.390> common<00:00:45.750> factor<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
there's still more common factor so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.279 
there's still more common factor so
let's<00:00:46.530> take<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:46.950> 12<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.270> 30<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:49.050> also

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
let's take a look 12 and 30 are also

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.279 
let's take a look 12 and 30 are also
once<00:00:49.680> again<00:00:49.950> both<00:00:50.129> even<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.879> 2<00:00:50.940> goes<00:00:51.690> into<00:00:52.110> both

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
once again both even so 2 goes into both

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.729 
once again both even so 2 goes into both
of<00:00:52.350> those<00:00:52.649> 12<00:00:53.520> divided<00:00:53.910> by<00:00:53.940> 2<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.660> 6<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.320> 30

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
of those 12 divided by 2 is 6 and 30

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
of those 12 divided by 2 is 6 and 30
divided<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.340> 2<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.210> 15<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:59.090> finally<00:01:00.090> 6<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> 15

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
divided by 2 is 15 and finally 6 and 15

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.070 
divided by 2 is 15 and finally 6 and 15
are<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:02.010> even<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.760> 3<00:01:03.420> goes<00:01:03.750> into<00:01:03.960> both

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
are not even but I know 3 goes into both

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.260 
are not even but I know 3 goes into both
of<00:01:04.229> those<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.339> 6<00:01:06.299> divided<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:06.869> 3<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.710> 2<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.030> 15

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
of those so 6 divided by 3 is 2 and 15

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
of those so 6 divided by 3 is 2 and 15
divided<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.080> 3<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:11.040> 5<00:01:11.960> now<00:01:12.960> 2<00:01:13.530> &amp;<00:01:13.710> 5<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:15.619> there's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
divided by 3 is 5 now 2 &amp; 5 are there's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
divided by 3 is 5 now 2 &amp; 5 are there's
no<00:01:16.740> common<00:01:17.070> factors<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.909> can

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
no common factors so what we can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.109 
no common factors so what we can
actually<00:01:18.240> say<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:20.070> two<00:01:20.460> numbers

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
actually say is that these two numbers

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:29.660 
actually say is that these two numbers
are<00:01:22.850> relatively<00:01:25.820> prime<00:01:28.250> meaning<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.400> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
are relatively prime meaning they have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.109 
are relatively prime meaning they have
no<00:01:30.030> common<00:01:30.780> factors<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:32.909> know

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
no common factors so that's how we know

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.060 
no common factors so that's how we know
we're<00:01:33.329> done<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:34.049> those<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:34.530> numbers<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
we're done when those two numbers at the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.670 
we're done when those two numbers at the
bottom<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.820> relatively<00:01:36.540> prime<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.500> let's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
bottom are relatively prime but let's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.390 
bottom are relatively prime but let's
focus<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> GCF<00:01:39.110> these<00:01:40.110> numbers<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:41.189> on

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
focus on the GCF these numbers here on

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.289 
focus on the GCF these numbers here on
the<00:01:41.759> left<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.360> all<00:01:42.390> common<00:01:43.140> factors<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.310> 24

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the left are all common factors of 24

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.990 
the left are all common factors of 24
and<00:01:45.420> 60<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.560> combine<00:01:46.829> those<00:01:47.579> common

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and 60 so if we combine those common

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.289 
and 60 so if we combine those common
factors<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.680> GCF<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
factors we actually get the GCF so the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.310 
factors we actually get the GCF so the
GCF<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.710> equal<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> 2<00:01:54.119> times<00:01:54.930> 2

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
GCF is going to be equal to 2 times 2

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.840 
GCF is going to be equal to 2 times 2
times<00:01:56.070> 3<00:01:56.579> which<00:01:56.960> happens<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> equal<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.250> 12

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
times 3 which happens to be equal to 12

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.800 
times 3 which happens to be equal to 12
so<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.810> GCF<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.469> 24<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.219> 60<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.850> 12<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.450> in

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
so the GCF of 24 and 60 is 12 or in

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.330 
so the GCF of 24 and 60 is 12 or in
other<00:02:03.960> words<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.409> largest<00:02:05.009> number<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
other words the largest number that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.830 
other words the largest number that
divides<00:02:05.490> evenly<00:02:06.149> into<00:02:06.630> both<00:02:07.320> 24<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.069> 60<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.390> 12

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
divides evenly into both 24 and 60 is 12

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.510 
divides evenly into both 24 and 60 is 12
and<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.129> look<00:02:11.160> at<00:02:11.400> these

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and actually if you look at these

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.330 
and actually if you look at these
numbers<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:12.090> at<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> bottom<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.930> can

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
numbers here at the bottom you can

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.600 
numbers here at the bottom you can
see<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.150> works<00:02:14.360> out<00:02:14.540> well<00:02:14.830> 24<00:02:15.830> divided

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
see that that works out well 24 divided

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.080 
see that that works out well 24 divided
by<00:02:16.640> 12<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:17.450> 2<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.610> 60<00:02:19.610> divided<00:02:20.450> by<00:02:20.569> 12<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.430> 5<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
by 12 is 2 and 60 divided by 12 is 5 and
