00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.069
 hello friends today we go with a dessert 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.639
 dedicated to chocolatiers pay of 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.639
 chocolate 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.410
 to prepare frola pasta 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.109
 we will need 220 grams of flour 130 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.509
 grams of icing sugar 30 grams of cocoa 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.849
 bitter powder 130 grams of 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.809
 butter that has to be fine 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:32.730
 cold an egg and 5 grams of powder 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.730
 Baking or chemical yeast 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 We begin by putting in the same bowl the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.000
 flour the yeast the bitter cocoa and the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.430
 icing sugar 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.850
 and mixing everything until you have a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.850
 uniform color 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.040
 in a separate bowl we put the butter 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.630
 cut into cubes and let's sift the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.230
 previous mix to make sure that 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.230
 no lumps left 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.510
 and now with your fingers or if you prefer 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.980
 with a fork we are integrating the 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.980
 butter with the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.750
 we have to make sure we have one 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.000
 kind of sand 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.000
 At this point we add the egg 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.260
 mix a little with a spoon or a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.420
 fork until it is integrated 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.690
 and then we go back to work with the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.030
 hands 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.460
 this mixture has to be worked alone 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 until it is well amalgamated is better 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.720
 do not work it too much 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.800
 this is the final goal a good ball 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.360
 amalgam that has a consistency 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.360
 similar to plasticine 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.490
 now the flat we are going well we wrap it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.320
 paper film and left resting 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.320
 the refrigerator for at least one hour 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.650
 After that time we extend 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.640
 the table a piece of film or paper 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.640
 wax paper 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.230
 we put the dough on top 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.270
 and without removing the transparent fill that 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.380
 we had put it before we started 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.380
 stretch it with a roller 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.470
 we have to make sure that there is more 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.220
 less than one size that serves to cover 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.220
 our mold 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.970
 we deposit it on our mold 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.450
 we remove the protection with a lot 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.060
 watch out 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.530
 and little by little we adapt the mass to 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.530
 the contours of our mold 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.710
 with the help of a knife we cut the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.510
 leftover dough this dough is very malleable 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.100
 so if we have stayed at any 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.410
 tear any discovered or 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.960
 Any little hole we can use 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.860
 this leftover mass to cover it and that he 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.860
 stay perfect 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.790
 let's puncture the entire surface of the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.370
 mass to make sure it does not go up 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.120
 too much, do not forget to click 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 also the edges 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.800
 and to make sure we're going to put something 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.560
 of weight over eg 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.660
 vegetables 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.510
 these vegetables can no longer be returned to 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.280
 use to eat them but always 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.810
 can save to reuse 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 the and re-make some kind of dough 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.760
 broken like this 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.590
 we put it in the preheated oven 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.590
 200 degrees for 15 minutes 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.330
 while the dough is cooled we will prepare 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.020
 the filling for which we are going to 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.530
 need 200 grams of chocolate 125 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.510
 grams of butter 3 eggs 150 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.720
 milliliters of cream to assemble or cream 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.720
 to beat and 175 grams of brown sugar 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.420
 I really have together in the microwave the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.580
 chocolate the butter remember 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.500
 always in 30 shots in 30 seconds 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.389
 to make sure that chocolate does not 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.669
 it's burning 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.710
 if you want to intensify the taste of 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.319
 mix I recommend you to throw a 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.319
 spoonful of coffee well loaded 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.750
 we add the three eggs 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.750
 and we beat well until they integrate 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.010
 we do the same with the cream 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.010
 and with sugar 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.840
 finally pour the filling over the 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.810
 dough 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.199
 and we bake this time at 180 degrees 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:12.419
 for about 40 or 45 minutes or until 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.419
 let's see that the filling is already done 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.920
 and that is how it is once it has been 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.080
 completely cooled 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.510
 I'm going to decorate it with some strawberries 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.130
 but you can use 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.370
 what you want the little bit of cream 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.730
 mounted a chocolate chips what 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.730
 you prefer 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.070
 and after a couple of hours of fridge 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.780
 this is how it is finally perfect 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.780
 for the most chocolatier palates 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.170
 this country is a delight not you 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.470
 you can lose I assure you that it deserves 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.470
 pain
