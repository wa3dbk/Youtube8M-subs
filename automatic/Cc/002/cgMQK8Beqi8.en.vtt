00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.230 
ahead and return once it's finished
okay<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:10.740> now<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.070> Apple<00:05:11.580> logo<00:05:11.700> actually

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
okay and now the Apple logo actually

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.510 
okay and now the Apple logo actually
went<00:05:12.450> away<00:05:12.540> came<00:05:13.050> back<00:05:13.110> up<00:05:13.440> again<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.040> we<00:05:14.280> have

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
went away came back up again and we have

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.450 
went away came back up again and we have
another<00:05:15.060> progress<00:05:15.570> wheel<00:05:16.220> focusing<00:05:17.220> there

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
another progress wheel focusing there

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.550 
another progress wheel focusing there
you<00:05:17.670> can<00:05:17.970> see<00:05:18.300> that<00:05:18.630> it's<00:05:18.840> actually<00:05:19.050> going<00:05:19.470> a

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
you can see that it's actually going a

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.200 
you can see that it's actually going a
lot<00:05:19.710> faster<00:05:20.280> than<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.550> other<00:05:20.670> one<00:05:20.790> the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
lot faster than the other one the

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.540 
lot faster than the other one the
initial<00:05:21.480> wheel<00:05:21.840> took<00:05:22.260> about<00:05:22.530> 10<00:05:23.010> minutes<00:05:23.040> or

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
initial wheel took about 10 minutes or

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.300 
initial wheel took about 10 minutes or
so<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:24.390> fully<00:05:24.690> complete<00:05:25.350> so<00:05:25.860> this<00:05:26.010> one<00:05:26.160> looks

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
so to fully complete so this one looks

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.250 
so to fully complete so this one looks
like<00:05:26.520> it's<00:05:26.670> just<00:05:26.750> finalizing<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.900> settings

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
like it's just finalizing the settings

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.380 
like it's just finalizing the settings
here<00:05:28.500> on<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.830> watch<00:05:29.010> itself<00:05:29.520> similar<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.270> what

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
here on the watch itself similar to what

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.060 
here on the watch itself similar to what
happens<00:05:30.720> on<00:05:30.840> iOS<00:05:31.230> when<00:05:31.470> you<00:05:31.560> complete<00:05:31.920> an

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
happens on iOS when you complete an

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.550 
happens on iOS when you complete an
update<00:05:32.460> okay<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.300> second<00:05:33.780> progress<00:05:34.290> loader

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
update okay the second progress loader

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.680 
update okay the second progress loader
is<00:05:34.770> gone<00:05:35.040> we<00:05:35.340> have<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.640> Apple<00:05:36.000> logo<00:05:36.180> once

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
is gone we have the Apple logo once

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.470 
is gone we have the Apple logo once
again<00:05:37.140> and<00:05:37.380> now<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.070> might<00:05:38.220> just<00:05:38.580> be<00:05:38.670> rebooting

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
again and now it might just be rebooting

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.630 
again and now it might just be rebooting
and<00:05:39.660> if<00:05:40.110> that's<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.530> case<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:41.040> will<00:05:41.190> take<00:05:41.430> some

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
and if that's the case it will take some

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.970 
and if that's the case it will take some
time<00:05:41.670> to<00:05:41.910> fully<00:05:42.360> come<00:05:42.720> up<00:05:42.900> here<00:05:43.200> the<00:05:43.530> watch<00:05:43.740> is

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
time to fully come up here the watch is

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.800 
time to fully come up here the watch is
back<00:05:44.190> up<00:05:44.400> now<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.610> entered<00:05:45.060> my<00:05:45.210> passcode<00:05:45.450> and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
back up now I entered my passcode and

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.700 
back up now I entered my passcode and
you'll<00:05:45.900> notice<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.170> the<00:05:46.380> battery

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
you'll notice that the battery

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.430 
you'll notice that the battery
percentage<00:05:46.980> is<00:05:47.460> at<00:05:47.640> 73<00:05:48.540> when<00:05:48.720> it<00:05:48.870> was<00:05:48.960> at<00:05:49.140> 80

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
percentage is at 73 when it was at 80

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.800 
percentage is at 73 when it was at 80
before<00:05:50.040> so<00:05:50.280> that's<00:05:50.430> obviously<00:05:50.700> why<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.420> need

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
before so that's obviously why you need

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.690 
before so that's obviously why you need
to<00:05:51.930> be<00:05:52.050> connected<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.710> a<00:05:52.740> power<00:05:53.010> source<00:05:53.190> in

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
to be connected to a power source in

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.970 
to be connected to a power source in

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
order to install updates it takes quite

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.070 
order to install updates it takes quite

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
emoji seeing as most of the changes are

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.020 
emoji seeing as most of the changes are
actually<00:06:22.440> under<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:22.890> hood<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.370> performance

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
actually under the hood and performance

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.240 
actually under the hood and performance
based<00:06:24.300> so<00:06:24.900> sending<00:06:25.200> myself<00:06:25.350> the<00:06:25.710> exact<00:06:26.010> same

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
based so sending myself the exact same

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.950 
based so sending myself the exact same
messages<00:06:26.730> before<00:06:27.150> with<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.420> same<00:06:27.600> skin<00:06:27.930> tone

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
messages before with the same skin tone

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.870 
messages before with the same skin tone
modifier<00:06:28.620> you'll<00:06:28.830> notice<00:06:29.130> that<00:06:29.250> it<00:06:29.370> shows<00:06:29.640> up

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
modifier you'll notice that it shows up

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.300 
modifier you'll notice that it shows up
correctly<00:06:30.600> now<00:06:30.810> so<00:06:31.470> that's<00:06:31.920> a<00:06:32.100> good<00:06:32.250> thing

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
correctly now so that's a good thing

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.880 
correctly now so that's a good thing
again<00:06:33.240> most<00:06:33.570> of<00:06:33.750> the<00:06:33.840> other<00:06:33.990> improvements<00:06:34.740> are

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
again most of the other improvements are

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.740 
again most of the other improvements are
performance<00:06:35.670> based<00:06:36.000> alright<00:06:36.420> guys<00:06:36.630> and

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
performance based alright guys and

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.300 
performance based alright guys and
that's<00:06:36.900> actually<00:06:37.260> going<00:06:37.410> to<00:06:37.500> wrap<00:06:37.830> up<00:06:38.070> this

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
that's actually going to wrap up this
