00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.290 
north of cranberry it's I don't know if
it's<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.200> boat<00:00:07.890> or<00:00:08.099> some<00:00:08.280> type<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.730> dock<00:00:09.000> it's

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
it's a boat or some type of a dock it's

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.910

got<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> little<00:00:09.690> bit<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.050> power<00:00:10.260> I'm<00:00:10.530> thinking

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
got a little bit of a power I'm thinking

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.850 
got a little bit of a power I'm thinking
it's<00:00:11.010> probably<00:00:11.460> more<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.830> scale<00:00:13.830> that

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
it's probably more like a scale that

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's probably more like a scale that
would<00:00:14.309> they<00:00:14.429> they<00:00:14.670> would<00:00:14.820> tow<00:00:15.030> behind<00:00:15.210> us<00:00:15.599> gift

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
would they they would tow behind us gift

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.870 
would they they would tow behind us gift
kind<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> wood<00:00:17.039> Scouts<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.699> up

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
kind of like the wood Scouts we have up

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.670 
kind of like the wood Scouts we have up
in<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.320> in<00:00:20.270> nakata<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:22.939> don't<00:00:23.939> see<00:00:24.240> any<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.779> don't

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
in the in nakata I don't see any I don't

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.419 
in the in nakata I don't see any I don't
see<00:00:25.920> any<00:00:27.230> sign<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.410> having<00:00:28.619> had<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> motor<00:00:29.250> out

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
see any sign of having had a motor out

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.359 
see any sign of having had a motor out
so<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:29.849> sure<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:31.340> like<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
so I'm pretty sure it's just a like a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.240

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
know this could have been anchored to a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.140 
know this could have been anchored to a
dock<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.940> maybe<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.239> work<00:02:36.420> platform<00:02:36.690> -
