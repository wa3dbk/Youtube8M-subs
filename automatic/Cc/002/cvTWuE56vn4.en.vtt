00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this last year with you know in my new

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.679 
this last year with you know in my new

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
coach there's a lot of the things that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.819 
coach there's a lot of the things that
we've<00:01:39.840> been<00:01:39.930> working<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> new<00:01:40.590> things

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
we've been working on the new things

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.480 
we've been working on the new things
that<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.790> he<00:01:42.270> felt<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.659> key<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.380> me<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.740> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that that he felt are key for me to you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.580 
that that he felt are key for me to you
know<00:01:44.610> reach<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> next<00:01:45.570> level<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:45.930> myself<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
know reach the next level for myself and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130 
know reach the next level for myself and
and<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.759> that's<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> key<00:01:48.960> for

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and I think that's that's the key for

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
and I think that's that's the key for
sure<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:49.619> what's<00:01:49.890> been<00:01:50.250> paying<00:01:50.520> off

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
sure and that's what's been paying off

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300 
sure and that's what's been paying off
these<00:01:51.119> last<00:01:51.329> three<00:01:51.600> weeks<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.049> 3-4<00:01:52.920> weeks<00:01:52.950> you

why do they do to that fact and your
rankings<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.530> mean<00:01:58.680> inevitably<00:01:59.070> gonna<00:01:59.219> rise<00:01:59.490> at

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
rankings I mean inevitably gonna rise at

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.569

least<00:01:59.969> sort<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.390> 1020<00:02:00.930> places<00:02:01.320> now<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.770> does

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
least sort of 1020 places now so does

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.550
