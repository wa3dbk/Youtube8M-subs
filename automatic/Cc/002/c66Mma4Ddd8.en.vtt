00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.729 
out of the saddle and possibly knock you
to<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.880> ground<00:03:35.940> -<00:03:36.300> so<00:03:36.690> it'll<00:03:37.290> take<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.500> while<00:03:37.680> to

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
to the ground - so it'll take a while to

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.729 
to the ground - so it'll take a while to
get<00:03:38.310> back<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> saddle<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.560> chase<00:03:40.560> after

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
get back in the saddle and chase after

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.199 
get back in the saddle and chase after
him<00:03:40.980> into<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.280> meantime<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.730> know<00:03:41.850> bolded

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
him into the meantime you know bolded

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.759 
him into the meantime you know bolded
riders<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.660> all<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.930> will<00:03:43.110> come<00:03:43.140> after<00:03:43.500> you

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
riders and all that will come after you

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.960 
riders and all that will come after you
and<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.519> big<00:03:44.670> pain<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.910> butt

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
and so it's just a big pain in the butt

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.460 
and so it's just a big pain in the butt
so<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.989> know<00:03:46.110> while<00:03:46.290> you're<00:03:46.380> running

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
so you know while you're running

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.900 
so you know while you're running
alongside<00:03:46.739> him<00:03:47.100> make<00:03:47.310> sure<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.459> precise<00:03:47.790> you

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
the bridge so he's got to be really

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.569 
the bridge so he's got to be really
careful<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.620> avoid<00:04:16.799> getting<00:04:17.160> hit<00:04:17.370> with<00:04:17.489> the

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579

front<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.940> oil<00:04:18.150> however<00:04:18.870> want<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.979> right<00:04:20.190> along

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
front of oil however want to right along

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.920 
front of oil however want to right along
the<00:04:20.489> side<00:04:20.700> get<00:04:20.910> as<00:04:21.120> close<00:04:21.269> as<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.450> can<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:21.870> you

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the side get as close as you can so you

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.469 
the side get as close as you can so you
can<00:04:22.049> slash<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.560> side<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:23.460> king<00:04:23.700> bullet<00:04:24.120> with

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
can slash the side of king bullet with

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.040 
can slash the side of king bullet with
your<00:04:24.630> sword

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.800 
your sword
so<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:26.150> recommend<00:04:27.150> sitting<00:04:27.390> on<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.630> right<00:04:27.750> side

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
so I recommend sitting on the right side

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.450 
so I recommend sitting on the right side
because<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.620> can<00:04:28.770> play<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.010> Wii<00:04:29.100> version

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
because you can play the Wii version

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.240 
because you can play the Wii version
that<00:04:29.640> these<00:04:29.820> wars<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.210> right<00:04:30.360> side<00:04:31.160> but<00:04:32.160> it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
that these wars on the right side but it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.730 
that these wars on the right side but it
makes<00:04:32.490> too<00:04:32.580> much<00:04:32.669> difference<00:04:33.110> but<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.410> like<00:04:34.650> to

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
makes too much difference but I like to

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.810 
makes too much difference but I like to
stay<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:34.979> right<00:04:35.070> side<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.490> then<00:04:35.610> once<00:04:35.729> you

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
stay on the right side and then once you

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.640 
stay on the right side and then once you
get<00:04:35.940> pretty<00:04:36.180> close<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.390> them<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:37.440> want<00:04:37.590> to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
get pretty close to them you want to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.930 
get pretty close to them you want to
swear<00:04:37.950> off<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.280> left<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.580> they<00:04:38.669> quickly

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
swear off to the left and they quickly

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.060

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
passing it this will lie close enough

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.840

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
guess he goes subconscious and when I

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.660 
guess he goes subconscious and when I
first<00:07:04.230> saw<00:07:04.410> this<00:07:04.560> I<00:07:04.680> actually<00:07:04.800> kind<00:07:05.580> of

like<00:07:07.320> that<00:07:07.410> and<00:07:07.590> I<00:07:07.680> thought<00:07:07.860> everybody<00:07:08.130> was

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
like that and I thought everybody was
