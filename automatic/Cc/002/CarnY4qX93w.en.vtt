00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
hair in place next to give my hair a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.290 
hair in place next to give my hair a
little<00:01:11.320> bit<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.650> hold<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.070> like<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.430> use<00:01:12.550> Dax<00:01:13.000> and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
little bit of hold I like to use Dax and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.359 
little bit of hold I like to use Dax and
this<00:01:13.509> works<00:01:13.780> really<00:01:14.140> really<00:01:14.259> great<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.160> if

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
this works really really great and if

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.950 
this works really really great and if
you<00:01:15.400> have<00:01:15.700> thicker<00:01:16.090> hair<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.570> would<00:01:16.630> suggest

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
you have thicker hair I would suggest

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.499 
you have thicker hair I would suggest
using<00:01:17.560> shea<00:01:18.340> butter<00:01:18.580> because<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.180> will<00:01:19.360> give

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
using shea butter because this will give

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.150 
using shea butter because this will give
you<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.660> little<00:01:19.899> bit<00:01:20.080> more<00:01:20.229> hold<00:01:20.470> because<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.979> is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
you a little bit more hold because it is

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.889 
you a little bit more hold because it is
thicker<00:01:21.310> as<00:01:21.640> well<00:01:21.880> if<00:01:22.030> your<00:01:22.210> hair<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.420> similar

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899

thicker as well if your hair is similar
to<00:01:23.110> mine<00:01:23.289> then<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.920> can<00:01:24.100> use<00:01:24.280> Dax<00:01:24.580> but<00:01:25.119> if<00:01:25.210> your

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.820 
to mine then you can use Dax but if your
hair<00:01:25.479> is<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> little<00:01:25.720> bit<00:01:25.899> thicker<00:01:26.170> or<00:01:26.500> if<00:01:26.710> you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
hair is a little bit thicker or if you

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.529 
hair is a little bit thicker or if you
want<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.160> little<00:01:27.310> bit<00:01:27.460> more<00:01:27.520> whole<00:01:27.910> then<00:01:28.390> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350

inside<00:03:19.129> and<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.420> really<00:03:20.900> helps<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.680> keep<00:03:21.890> it

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
inside and this really helps to keep it

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:55.259 
inside and this really helps to keep it
down
