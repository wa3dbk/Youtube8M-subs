00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640 

I<00:00:02.060> can't<00:00:03.060> won't<00:00:03.179> let<00:00:03.389> me<00:00:03.540> get<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> good<00:00:04.319> shot<00:00:04.350> of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
I can't won't let me get a good shot of

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.909 
I can't won't let me get a good shot of
it<00:00:04.980> but<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.420> just<00:00:07.230> figured<00:00:07.589> out<00:00:07.710> about

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
it but this I just figured out about

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.669 
it but this I just figured out about
this<00:00:08.630> it's<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:10.130> homemade<00:00:11.130> cat<00:00:11.759> toy<00:00:12.349> and<00:00:13.349> as<00:00:13.530> you

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
this it's a homemade cat toy and as you

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.620 
this it's a homemade cat toy and as you
can<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:13.889> they<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.969> play<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.389> it

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
can see they really like to play with it

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.490 
can see they really like to play with it
and<00:00:16.640> it's<00:00:17.640> very<00:00:18.000> expensive<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.810> make<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.380> can

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and it's very expensive to make you can

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.820 
and it's very expensive to make you can
either<00:00:19.619> use<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.369> toilet<00:00:20.910> paper<00:00:21.210> roll<00:00:21.449> tube<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
either use a toilet paper roll tube you

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.990 
either use a toilet paper roll tube you
just<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> make<00:00:23.310> sure<00:00:23.369> all<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.760> toilet

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
just have to make sure all the toilet

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.259 
just have to make sure all the toilet
papers<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:24.779> there's<00:00:24.990> no<00:00:25.109> fibers<00:00:25.560> or<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
papers off and if there's no fibers or a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.179 
papers off and if there's no fibers or a
paper<00:00:27.269> towel<00:00:27.570> tube<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.109> same<00:00:28.349> way<00:00:28.529> no<00:00:28.740> fibers

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
paper towel tube the same way no fibers

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.330 
paper towel tube the same way no fibers
on<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.580> what'd<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.590> cut

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
on it what'd you just do is you cut

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.990 
on it what'd you just do is you cut
slits<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.210> each<00:00:33.360> side<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
slits in it on each side and then you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.540 
slits in it on each side and then you
flatten<00:00:36.000> down<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.630> looks<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.989> little

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
flatten down so it looks like a little

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.490 
flatten down so it looks like a little
spikes<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.510> supposed<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.079> roll<00:00:40.350> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
spikes and it's supposed to just roll on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
spikes and it's supposed to just roll on
the<00:00:40.649> carpet<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the carpet but as you can see the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
the carpet but as you can see the
mistake<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.079> made<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.649> cutting<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> in

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
mistake I made was cutting it in

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.200 
mistake I made was cutting it in
different<00:00:45.020> selects<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.940> one

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
different selects like this one this one

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.060 
different selects like this one this one
looks<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.719> clear<00:00:49.050> down<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
looks like clear down here and then this

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.310 
looks like clear down here and then this
goes<00:00:50.309> way<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.750> want<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> at

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
goes way up here you want to do it at

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.340 
goes way up here you want to do it at
the<00:00:52.410> same<00:00:52.590> even<00:00:52.980> length<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.460> suggest<00:00:54.140> doing<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the same even length I suggest doing the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.709 
the same even length I suggest doing the
ones<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> little<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.449> not

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
ones that are a little bit like this not

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840 
ones that are a little bit like this not
all<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.350> here<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> do

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
all the way down here because if you do

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.560 
all the way down here because if you do
that<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.300> let<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.170> say<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.329> because<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that then let me say it because if you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.969 
that then let me say it because if you
do<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.140> probably<00:01:04.409> run<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> risk

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
do that then you probably run the risk

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
do that then you probably run the risk
of<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.339> cutting<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.750> through

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
of just cutting it all the way through

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.859 
of just cutting it all the way through
so<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.770> probably<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.729> blow<00:01:11.570> as<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.750> can

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so I probably do it can blow as you can

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
so I probably do it can blow as you can
see<00:01:13.049> cats<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> play<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> but

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
see cats really like to play with it but

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.840 
see cats really like to play with it but
see<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.840> clear<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.290> here

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
see if you do it like clear down here

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.100 
see if you do it like clear down here
it's<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> work<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.659> well<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it's not going to work as well so I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's not going to work as well so I
suggest<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:21.030> length<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:22.970> you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
suggest about this length right here you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
suggest about this length right here you
just<00:01:24.150> cut<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.509> each<00:01:24.659> side<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.409> just

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
just cut it on each side you just

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.310 
just cut it on each side you just
flatten<00:01:26.009> about<00:01:26.479> which<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> hard<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
flatten about which is hard to have it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
flatten about which is hard to have it
flat<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.890> guys<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.340> she's<00:01:29.689> done

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
flat for you guys because she's done

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.780 
flat for you guys because she's done
played<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> bunch<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> cut<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
played with it a bunch and if you cut it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
played with it a bunch and if you cut it
even<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> way<00:01:33.720> around<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:37.700> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> cut

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
even all the way around it's if you cut

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
even all the way around it's if you cut
it<00:01:39.090> flat<00:01:39.420> even<00:01:39.689> each<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.530> around<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.280> it's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it flat even each way around what it's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.660 
it flat even each way around what it's
supposed<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.509> supposed<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
supposed to do is it's supposed to just

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
supposed to do is it's supposed to just
slide<00:01:44.670> across<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> floor<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> don't<00:01:46.079> even

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
slide across the floor if you don't even

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
slide across the floor if you don't even
get<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.619> far<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.250> head<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.610> it's

get that far with your head because it's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.510 
get that far with your head because it's
not<00:01:47.939> getting<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.420> far<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.840> mine

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
not getting that far with mine

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.860 
not getting that far with mine
she<00:01:50.520> loves<00:01:50.730> it<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.940> pieces<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.540> cheap

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
she loves it to pieces is cheap

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.290 
she loves it to pieces is cheap
inexpensive<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.980> it's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.220> great<00:01:53.400> great<00:01:53.970> way

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
inexpensive and it's a great great way

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.110
