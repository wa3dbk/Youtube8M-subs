00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.999
 at the moment we click on login 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.130
 unlike the telephone network 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.660
 with voip technology a login is necessary 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.500
 then we take you off to see which of these contacts are connected to be able 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.980
 call them stick 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.600
 for that reason the sip protocol was developed 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.330
 ead october is that it makes it rivals with pacheta disasters that adapt and 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.140
 trot 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 both are intended to become the standard for home 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.280
 of multimedia sessions 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.130
 although this protocol is also used during the telephone call 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.170
 this is necessary because we still have connection type things 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.560
 as it happened with the traditional time 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.330
 yes no we have to find out if the user is behind an atc onfray 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.240
 higuaín 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.870
 in addition the protocol initiate session besides they will also go the ip address 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.910
 the client's 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.910
 it could connect from anywhere on the planet 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 the joseph revealed that it affects the river 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.930
 it will be in the park 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.300
 another difference is that internet cascón to the rector and in each connection with all 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.170
 the advantages that inconveniences that this entails 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.180
 for example if the network was saturated the quality of conversation will be lower 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.670
 to a traditional phone call 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.030
 but we have the advantage that both the call and the terminals are much 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.380
 more economical 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.680
 besides it we can have other resources such as videoconference and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.010
 very tikhon palencia 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.479
 file transfer and a long list of related services 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.799
 we can also observe that the telephone network terminals were quite 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.099
 This way it was simple to close the user but now it is necessary that the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.399
 terminals put a greater processing capacity 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:17.759
 The first thing you have to do is who are you going and expressed to you that the base is a 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.229
 honda elisa the audio signal that the microphone picks up 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.969
 this is imperative 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.779
 well, we are sending information in binary form and it also occupies 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.399
 eminem arcade possible 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:35.559
 for this they use 729 codex trading is sitting table and tote coding 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.699
 audio in packs every 10 milliseconds 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.729
 with esther goris morte if we had a minimum of eight kilometers per second 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.760
 although this represents the bandwidth needed for the transmission 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:51.389
 you can contribute more information although of course support understanding 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.389
 lower audio quality 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.629
 once we have the information processed 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.000
 it is encapsulated 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.459
 generally one of range join 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.309
 although it does not allow for greater flexibility as well as lower latency 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.179
 subsequently it is sent as a package of any 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.999
 for the mind it is usually used r tcp 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.659
 to control the state of the network 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.269
 When the packet arrives at its destination it is necessary to decode the data so that 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.549
 I hate it to be heard fully for the other user 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.269
 friends
