alright<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.550> Nate<00:00:02.760> storey<00:00:02.939> with<00:00:03.060> bright

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
alright this is Nate storey with bright

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.660 
alright this is Nate storey with bright
Agrotech<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.319> part<00:00:04.620> four<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.190> our

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
Agrotech and this is part four of our

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.450 
Agrotech and this is part four of our
series<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:06.600> potassium<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:08.040> I'm<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.400> to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
series on potassium and now I'm going to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.600 
series on potassium and now I'm going to
talk<00:00:08.639> about<00:00:08.820> how<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.210> treat<00:00:10.610> potassium

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
talk about how we treat potassium

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.610 
talk about how we treat potassium
deficiencies<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.420> how<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:12.929> manage<00:00:13.230> our

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
deficiencies and how we manage our

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.140 
deficiencies and how we manage our
system<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.490> don't<00:00:14.639> end<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.089> with

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
system so that we don't end up with

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150 
system so that we don't end up with
potassium<00:00:15.900> deficiencies<00:00:16.470> really<00:00:16.770> regularly

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
potassium deficiencies really regularly

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.890 
potassium deficiencies really regularly
because<00:00:17.670> those<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:18.029> really<00:00:18.480> cut<00:00:18.660> into<00:00:18.810> our

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
because those can really cut into our

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
because those can really cut into our
productivity<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> historically<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.480> had

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
productivity so historically we have had

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
productivity so historically we have had
to<00:00:24.990> supplement<00:00:25.490> systems<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.699> potassium

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to supplement systems with potassium

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.839 
to supplement systems with potassium
whether<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.320> potassium<00:00:28.920> carbonate<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
whether it's a potassium carbonate or a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.990 
whether it's a potassium carbonate or a
potassium<00:00:30.210> based<00:00:30.779> hydroxide<00:00:31.579> we're<00:00:32.579> adding

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
potassium based hydroxide we're adding

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.660 
potassium based hydroxide we're adding
potassium<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> system<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.620> many<00:00:35.340> folks

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
potassium to the system and many folks

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
potassium to the system and many folks
who<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.540> adding<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.500> seaweed<00:00:37.890> extracts

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
who are adding like seaweed extracts

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
who are adding like seaweed extracts
that<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.910> thing<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.360> realize

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that kind of thing they don't realize

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.209 
that kind of thing they don't realize
that<00:00:39.960> they're<00:00:40.110> also<00:00:40.559> supplementing

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that they're also supplementing

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.910 
that they're also supplementing
potassium<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> seaweed<00:00:43.320> extract<00:00:43.770> in

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
potassium we use a seaweed extract in

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.790 
potassium we use a seaweed extract in
our<00:00:44.040> system<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> rating<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.800> zero

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
our system it's got a rating of zero

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.100 
our system it's got a rating of zero
zero<00:00:46.890> ten<00:00:47.550> okay<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.800> our<00:00:49.920> NPK<00:00:50.399> rating

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
zero ten okay so this is our NPK rating

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
zero ten okay so this is our NPK rating
so<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.469> kind<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.399> kelp<00:00:53.640> meal

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so this is kind of a the kelp meal

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.049 
so this is kind of a the kelp meal
concentrate<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.809> use<00:00:55.340> has<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.640> rating

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
concentrate that we use has this rating

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
concentrate that we use has this rating
and<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.680> kelp<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and you can see then that that kelp and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.289 
and you can see then that that kelp and
kelp<00:01:00.059> meal<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:01.170> very<00:01:02.010> high<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.789> potassium

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
kelp meal is very very high in potassium

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
kelp meal is very very high in potassium
carbonates<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.619> hydroxides<00:01:07.619> are<00:01:07.830> also<00:01:08.040> high

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
carbonates and hydroxides are also high

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
carbonates and hydroxides are also high
in<00:01:08.670> potassium<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> nice<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
in potassium and the nice thing is is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
in potassium and the nice thing is is
they're<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.380> supplementing<00:01:11.119> nitrogen<00:01:12.119> or

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
they're not supplementing nitrogen or

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.320 
they're not supplementing nitrogen or
potassium<00:01:12.740> okay<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.159> end<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.030> put

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
potassium okay so we end up when we put

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.710 
potassium okay so we end up when we put
a<00:01:15.710> patate<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:16.950> phosphorous<00:01:17.850> re<00:01:18.030> phosphorous

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
a patate or phosphorous re phosphorous

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
a patate or phosphorous re phosphorous
so<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.590> put<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> potassium

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
so when we put like a potassium

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.899 
so when we put like a potassium
hydroxide<00:01:21.439> like<00:01:22.439> caustic<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> caustic

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
hydroxide like caustic like a caustic

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
hydroxide like caustic like a caustic
lye<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.900> potassium<00:01:25.710> hydroxide<00:01:27.500> Koh<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
lye is a potassium hydroxide Koh this is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.140 
lye is a potassium hydroxide Koh this is
caustic<00:01:29.970> lye<00:01:30.150> okay<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:32.150> something

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
caustic lye okay and this is something

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.630 
caustic lye okay and this is something
that<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.390> use<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> pH<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.470> very<00:01:34.710> low<00:01:35.100> we

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that we use when the pH is very low we

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.810 
that we use when the pH is very low we
also<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.210> potassium<00:01:37.079> carbonate<00:01:37.829> okay<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
also have potassium carbonate okay so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.569 
also have potassium carbonate okay so
this<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.390> K<00:01:40.880> usually<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.180> two<00:01:42.600> co3

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
this is K usually it's like a two co3

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.069 
this is K usually it's like a two co3
there's<00:01:44.579> there's<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> few<00:01:45.840> different

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
there's there's a few different

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.249 
there's there's a few different
carbonates<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.509> bicarbonates<00:01:48.509> but

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
carbonates there and bicarbonates but

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.920 
carbonates there and bicarbonates but
you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.189> we're<00:01:50.369> adding<00:01:50.759> carbonates<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you know we're adding carbonates and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.980 
you know we're adding carbonates and
we're<00:01:52.470> adding<00:01:52.909> hydroxides<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.810> only

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
we're adding hydroxides but they only

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.139 
we're adding hydroxides but they only
work<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.590> low<00:01:55.740> pH<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.549> both<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> these

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
work at low pH is because both of these

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.630 
work at low pH is because both of these
substances<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:58.020> our<00:01:58.950> carbonate<00:01:59.460> sandai

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
substances are our carbonate sandai

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.230 
substances are our carbonate sandai
hydroxides<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.840> raise<00:02:01.110> our<00:02:01.520> pH<00:02:02.520> right<00:02:03.000> these

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
hydroxides will raise our pH right these

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.109 
hydroxides will raise our pH right these
are<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:03.899> very<00:02:04.170> basic<00:02:04.469> compounds<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.000> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
are very very basic compounds so this is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
are very very basic compounds so this is
one<00:02:06.299> reason<00:02:06.479> why<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.140> people<00:02:07.469> will<00:02:07.619> use

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
one reason why a lot of people will use

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.070 
one reason why a lot of people will use
kelp<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.819> supplement<00:02:09.300> potassium<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.959> their

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
kelp to supplement potassium in their

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.330 
kelp to supplement potassium in their
system<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.220> pH<00:02:11.550> neutral

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.589 

so<00:02:15.340> there<00:02:15.489> are<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.849> other<00:02:16.239> substances

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
so there are a lot of other substances

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.430 
so there are a lot of other substances
that<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.140> can<00:02:17.440> use<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:19.110> depending<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.170> kind

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
that you can use and depending on kind

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.890 
that you can use and depending on kind
of<00:02:20.590> how<00:02:20.680> your<00:02:20.830> system<00:02:21.220> runs<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.569> choose

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
of how your system runs you can choose

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.809 
of how your system runs you can choose
from<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.680> number<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:24.069> different<00:02:24.400> things<00:02:24.550> and

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
from a number of different things and

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.640 
from a number of different things and
I'm<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.090> talk<00:02:25.209> about<00:02:25.239> those<00:02:25.629> today<00:02:25.870> so

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
I'm going to talk about those today so

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.530 
I'm going to talk about those today so
far<00:02:26.890> we've<00:02:27.099> just<00:02:27.129> talked<00:02:27.519> about<00:02:27.849> mostly

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
far we've just talked about mostly

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.080 
far we've just talked about mostly
substances<00:02:29.349> that<00:02:29.650> we<00:02:29.950> add<00:02:30.099> to<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.459> solution

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
substances that we add to the solution

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.120 
substances that we add to the solution
now<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.510> can't<00:02:31.810> spray<00:02:32.170> something<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.769> kelp

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
now you can't spray something like kelp

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.860 
now you can't spray something like kelp
meal<00:02:33.250> concentrate<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.209> plant<00:02:34.450> leaves<00:02:34.690> so

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
meal concentrate on the plant leaves so

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.930 
meal concentrate on the plant leaves so
you<00:02:34.900> can't<00:02:35.140> apply<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.440> foliar<00:02:35.709> li<00:02:36.069> which<00:02:36.670> means

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you can't apply it foliar li which means

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.370 
you can't apply it foliar li which means
the<00:02:37.209> plants<00:02:37.510> absorb<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.959> directly<00:02:38.290> through

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
the plants absorb it directly through

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.460 
the plants absorb it directly through
their<00:02:38.739> leaves<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.730> utilize<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.390> but<00:02:41.080> by

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
their leaves and can utilize it but by

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.080 
their leaves and can utilize it but by
and<00:02:41.650> large<00:02:41.709> most<00:02:42.040> people<00:02:42.370> are<00:02:42.459> adding<00:02:42.819> like

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
and large most people are adding like

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.220 
and large most people are adding like
they're<00:02:43.599> there

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
they're there

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.900 
they're there
kelp<00:02:44.560> concentrates<00:02:45.280> or<00:02:45.459> their<00:02:45.580> kelp<00:02:45.790> meal

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
kelp concentrates or their kelp meal

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.780 
kelp concentrates or their kelp meal
concentrates<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.470> water<00:02:47.680> itself<00:02:48.190> which

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
concentrates to the water itself which

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.339 
concentrates to the water itself which
is<00:02:48.940> easy<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.840> not<00:02:49.989> always<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.319> most

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
is easy but not always the most

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.830 
is easy but not always the most
efficient<00:02:50.980> method<00:02:51.340> there<00:02:52.329> are<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.510> few<00:02:52.660> other

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
efficient method there are a few other

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.170 
efficient method there are a few other
things<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:53.349> can<00:02:53.500> also<00:02:53.799> do<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.489> we

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
things that we can also do this with we

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.370 
things that we can also do this with we
use<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> potassium<00:02:56.440> sulfate<00:02:56.920> okay<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:58.030> we<00:02:58.690> use<00:02:58.989> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
use a potassium sulfate okay so we use a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.690 
use a potassium sulfate okay so we use a
potassium<00:03:00.010> sulfate<00:03:00.700> here<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.950> occasion<00:03:03.519> and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
potassium sulfate here on occasion and

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.539 
potassium sulfate here on occasion and
most<00:03:04.329> potassium<00:03:04.930> sulfate<00:03:05.380> has<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.250> rating

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
most potassium sulfate has the rating

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.350 
most potassium sulfate has the rating
zero<00:03:06.900> zero<00:03:07.900> 50<00:03:08.560> okay<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> very<00:03:09.940> fast

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
zero zero 50 okay so this is a very fast

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
zero zero 50 okay so this is a very fast
response<00:03:11.489> super<00:03:12.489> fast<00:03:12.760> response<00:03:13.380> potassium

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.789 
response super fast response potassium
addition<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:16.660> systems<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.319> if<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.590> are

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
addition for systems and if you are

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.039 
addition for systems and if you are
experiencing<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.609> potassium<00:03:18.880> deficiency<00:03:19.180> and

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
experiencing a potassium deficiency and

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.830 
experiencing a potassium deficiency and
you<00:03:20.650> want<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.100> treat<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.120> solution<00:03:22.690> I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
you want to treat it in the solution I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.590 
you want to treat it in the solution I
would<00:03:23.260> highly<00:03:23.650> recommend<00:03:24.209> using<00:03:25.209> potassium

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
would highly recommend using potassium

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.569 
would highly recommend using potassium
sulfate<00:03:26.319> because<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.620> get<00:03:26.769> very<00:03:27.100> quick

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
sulfate because you get very quick

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.509 
sulfate because you get very quick
results<00:03:28.209> now<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.230> can't<00:03:29.709> really<00:03:29.920> apply<00:03:30.400> this

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
results now you can't really apply this

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.460 
results now you can't really apply this
Folie<00:03:30.880> early<00:03:31.209> that's<00:03:31.540> one<00:03:31.780> drawback<00:03:32.019> you

Folie early that's one drawback you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.629 
Folie early that's one drawback you
don't<00:03:32.680> want<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.920> be<00:03:33.010> praying<00:03:33.250> spraying

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
don't want to be praying spraying

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.610 
don't want to be praying spraying

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
potassium sulfate on your leaves but you

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.759 
potassium sulfate on your leaves but you
know<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.130> works<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:36.850> correct<00:03:37.180> these

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
know it works to correct these

to two weeks then you're going to have

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.720 
to two weeks then you're going to have
to<00:03:49.060> use<00:03:49.269> potassium<00:03:49.660> chloride<00:03:50.260> okay<00:03:51.100> so

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
to use potassium chloride okay so

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.670 
to use potassium chloride okay so
potassium<00:03:52.600> chloride<00:03:54.150> it's<00:03:55.150> it's<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:56.019> simple

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
potassium chloride it's it's a simple

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.520 
potassium chloride it's it's a simple
salt<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.819> lot<00:03:58.299> of<00:03:58.420> people<00:03:58.630> use<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:58.959> di<00:03:59.170> circo

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
salt a lot of people use it in di circo

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.879 
salt a lot of people use it in di circo
a<00:03:59.680> lot<00:03:59.889> of<00:03:59.980> de-icing<00:04:01.049> salts<00:04:02.049> use<00:04:02.530> potassium

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
a lot of de-icing salts use potassium

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.449 
a lot of de-icing salts use potassium
chloride<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.790> it's<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.660> great<00:04:05.200> great<00:04:05.709> thing<00:04:06.310> to

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
chloride and it's a great great thing to

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.460 
chloride and it's a great great thing to
use<00:04:06.489> for<00:04:06.700> foliar<00:04:07.569> applications<00:04:08.319> okay<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:10.470> make

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
use for foliar applications okay so make

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.599 
use for foliar applications okay so make
sure<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:11.919> you<00:04:12.040> check<00:04:12.220> out<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> vertical
