00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
of Tristan strong well I've known coach

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.710 
of Tristan strong well I've known coach
pry<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.460> long<00:02:26.670> time<00:02:27.000> another<00:02:27.450> type<00:02:27.690> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
pry for a long time another type of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.600 
pry for a long time another type of
coach<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.500> type<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.710> person<00:02:28.860> he<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.490> I

trusting<00:02:32.550> strong<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.330> not<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:33.960> chase

really<00:02:36.630> those<00:02:37.260> guys<00:02:37.440> are<00:02:37.709> playing<00:02:37.890> with<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.100> lot

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
really those guys are playing with a lot

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.770 
really those guys are playing with a lot
of<00:02:38.280> conference<00:02:38.850> they<00:02:38.970> understand<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> scheme

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
of conference they understand the scheme

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.260

they<00:02:39.959> understand<00:02:40.320> their<00:02:40.440> fits<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.340> why<00:02:41.880> I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
they understand their fits and and why I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.699 
they understand their fits and and why I
think<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> big<00:02:42.900> picture<00:02:43.140> does<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> great<00:02:43.680> job

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709
