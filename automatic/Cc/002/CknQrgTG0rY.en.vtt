00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 there are forests all over the world 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.870
 swamps and lakes but there was a lake in 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.889
 particular that people did not want 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.470
 approach him for fear of rumors 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.060
 for fear of discovering whether it was true or not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 that in the depths of that lake 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 there is a marine temple with thousands of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.199
 treasures but it was not going to be all that easy 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.079
 in that temple nobody got to enter 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.680
 they never saw the brightness of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.550
 coins from the surface could 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 imagine what to do with so much wealth 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.890
 but they did not dare to go down for it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 of that pokemon that was guarding him was going to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.489
 to stop him always some knew him 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.699
 as he finishes dreams others like the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.160
 marine devil but it was really a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.600
 it was flirting but it was not the size 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.350
 normal 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 it measured approximately 7 meters from the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.299
 tail to the jaw 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.320
 many saw their shadow swimming from a 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.369
 side by side of the lake always attentive 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 always watching they say that treasure 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.140
 belonged to a former pirate who 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.990
 hid there before dying and that was the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.329
 owner of that pokemon for that to do 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.270
 to flirt is the last thing left of his 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.750
 coach for others is a lifetime 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 dreamed but as always there has to be 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 a brave or an insolent one who tries 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.810
 down for the day said they never 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 I saw was to flirt swimming they believed that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.069
 this dreamer slept decided to dive to 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.969
 the temple just as the sun broke in 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:56.819
 the dawn dived in the water diving 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.869
 until the first meter of depth not 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:03.840
 saw nothing or just a fish followed 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.900
 until the temple his heart beat to all 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.310
 hurry they looked from one side to another 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.530
 and a sign of life I could not believe it 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.410
 was filling the third bag of those 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.170
 precious shiny coins was 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.900
 building the house of his dreams in 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.560
 the mind had already loaded enough 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.260
 bags but the weight could not go back to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.030
 the surface nor august at the exit of 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.520
 temple saw a huge jaw 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.160
 approaching him directly and saw how 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.670
 his right arm fell to the bottom of the lake 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.670
 with all the bags full of gold in 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.560
 they had passed so fleeting that even their 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.730
 mind did not allow him to believe what he had 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.520
 passed on the next turn saw the tail 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.620
 seven meters was much more he knew 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.450
 when he hit her with it in the chest and 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.330
 it took away the little air that was left 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.250
 the lungs the next movement does not 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.940
 had to do nobody nor the monster of 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.250
 feral and heron or that without an arm 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.050
 bleeding and without air his life 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.290
 turned off at the moment 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.270
 remember not everything is what it seems to 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.270
 simple sight chao
