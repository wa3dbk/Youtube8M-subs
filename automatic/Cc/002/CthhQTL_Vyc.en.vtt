00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.080
 You can see these shades of blue a lot. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.719
 cold yellow orange everything hot 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.580
 the blue whiting is already beginning to cool and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.450
 this green here already represents a bit 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.199
 of cold 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.689
 Look what happens on the 22nd on the 23rd. 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 from the 22nd day 23rd look here you do not have the air 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.289
 with 10 degrees being estimated for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.860
 enter in mato grosso do sul day 23 day 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.020
 24 looks at how that polar air comes up 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.600
 of mato grosso do sul over the region 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.809
 of mato grosso mato and looks like it 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.100
 it's coming, look, it looks like it evolves there 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.410
 up to the region of the right and rondônia 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.199
 so look how it's approaching 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 these greens that already represent this air 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.190
 polar 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.559
 Look how the temperature drops on top of the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.690
 region is also a mass 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.600
 that she will actually enter with 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.180
 force upon Brazil will give to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 cause of the cold in the north of the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.659
 Brazil 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.580
 the evolution from then on the 22nd to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.479
 people will start to see this polar air if 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900
 spreading out 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.200
 the estimate for day 21 18 degrees or 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.580
 It's nothing special either. 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.939
 the estimated temperature for the 9 hours of the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.100
 what happens on the 22nd day 21 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.880
 22 this area here is representing 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 here temperature of 10 degrees for less 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 here you are looking at the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.030
 day 23 with 4 degrees 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.180
 I have frost and I have not got any. 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.369
 it is possible to change right there 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.079
 for example that this area of ​​10 degrees 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 advance a little closer to 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.119
 Paul yes it's possible 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.820
 Yeah we can have temperatures in 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.969
 around 10 degrees to around after 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.909
 is after 23-24 in São 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.860
 Paul, I think I do. What you have is right. 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.390
 has the strong polar to enter brazil 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.190
 at the end of the next week 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.190
 then from day 22
