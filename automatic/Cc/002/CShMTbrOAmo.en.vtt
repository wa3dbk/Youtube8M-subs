welcome back to the team Art Academy

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.900 
welcome back to the team Art Academy
where<00:00:40.650> this<00:00:40.770> week<00:00:41.010> we're<00:00:41.250> back<00:00:41.490> at<00:00:41.640> learning

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
where this week we're back at learning

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.880 
where this week we're back at learning
archery<00:00:42.060> with<00:00:42.660> our<00:00:42.810> resident<00:00:43.200> artery<00:00:43.530> expert

archery with our resident artery expert

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190 
archery with our resident artery expert
Ben<00:00:44.130> Jones<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.940> he<00:00:45.180> shows<00:00:45.390> us<00:00:45.570> how<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.780> zero<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
Ben Jones as he shows us how to zero a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.360 
Ben Jones as he shows us how to zero a
pin<00:00:46.470> sight

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.410 

what<00:00:55.370> we're<00:00:55.489> going<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:55.640> do<00:00:55.789> now<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.120> set<00:00:56.300> the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
what we're going to do now is set the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.079 
what we're going to do now is set the
sights<00:00:56.690> up<00:00:56.989> these<00:00:57.949> sights<00:00:58.460> are<00:00:58.640> set<00:00:58.850> by<00:00:59.030> the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
sights up these sights are set by the

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.549 
sights up these sights are set by the
factory<00:00:59.600> so<00:00:59.780> there's<00:00:59.930> no<00:01:00.079> way<00:01:00.289> that<00:01:00.320> these

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
factory so there's no way that these

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.319 
factory so there's no way that these
sights<00:01:00.860> are<00:01:00.980> going<00:01:01.129> to<00:01:01.219> be<00:01:01.309> correct<00:01:01.670> well

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
sights are going to be correct well

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.119 
sights are going to be correct well
there's<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.539> very<00:01:02.629> slim<00:01:02.960> chance<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:03.620> we'll<00:01:03.980> be

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
there's a very slim chance that we'll be

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:04.660 
there's a very slim chance that we'll be
correct

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
correct

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.310 
correct
but<00:01:05.089> what<00:01:05.239> we<00:01:05.330> don't<00:01:05.420> want<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.659> do<00:01:05.750> is<00:01:05.869> lose<00:01:06.080> one

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
but what we don't want to do is lose one

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.499 
but what we don't want to do is lose one
of<00:01:06.350> our<00:01:06.530> new<00:01:06.710> arrows<00:01:07.040> straight<00:01:07.369> away<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.390> I've

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
of our new arrows straight away so I've

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.190 
of our new arrows straight away so I've
set<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.930> target<00:01:09.440> at<00:01:09.979> only<00:01:10.190> ten<00:01:10.399> yards<00:01:11.200> that's

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
set the target at only ten yards that's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.719 
set the target at only ten yards that's
close<00:01:12.560> enough<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.950> know<00:01:12.979> that<00:01:13.190> if<00:01:13.430> I<00:01:13.549> make<00:01:13.580> a

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
close enough to know that if I make a

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.389 
close enough to know that if I make a
reasonable<00:01:14.270> shot<00:01:14.509> no<00:01:15.409> matter<00:01:15.440> where<00:01:16.220> these

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
reasonable shot no matter where these

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.370 
reasonable shot no matter where these
sight<00:01:16.670> pins<00:01:16.970> are<00:01:17.180> within<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.659> housing<00:01:18.200> I

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
sight pins are within this housing I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.370 
sight pins are within this housing I
should<00:01:19.039> hit<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.340> target<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:20.570> by<00:01:20.899> that's<00:01:21.229> by

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
should hit the target but by that's by

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.389 
should hit the target but by that's by
no<00:01:21.409> means<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.330> dead<00:01:23.330> cert<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.470> all<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:24.860> know<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.280> it

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
no means a dead cert so all I know is it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.300 
no means a dead cert so all I know is it
this<00:01:25.520> distance<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:27.319> chances<00:01:27.800> of<00:01:27.920> missing<00:01:28.100> are

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
this distance the chances of missing are

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.100 
this distance the chances of missing are
very<00:01:28.460> low<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.330> I'm<00:01:29.420> going<00:01:29.569> to<00:01:29.600> use<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.899> first

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
very low so I'm going to use the first

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.380 
very low so I'm going to use the first
couple<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.590> shots<00:01:30.649> just<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.880> make<00:01:32.060> sure<00:01:32.090> I'm

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
couple of shots just to make sure I'm

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.059 
couple of shots just to make sure I'm
roughly<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.899> target<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.530> then<00:01:33.619> gradually

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
roughly on target and then gradually

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:46.430 
roughly on target and then gradually
start<00:01:34.310> pushing<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.729> target<00:01:35.119> back

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.840 

so<00:01:47.440> we<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.650> see<00:01:47.800> by<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.040> impact<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.700> arrow

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
so we can see by the impact of the arrow

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.380 
so we can see by the impact of the arrow
it<00:01:49.240> was<00:01:49.480> high<00:01:49.960> left<00:01:50.230> in<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> eighth<00:01:50.770> ring<00:01:51.390> so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
it was high left in the eighth ring so

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.840 
it was high left in the eighth ring so
at<00:01:52.510> ten<00:01:52.690> yards<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.770> wasn't<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.100> bad<00:01:54.250> guess<00:01:54.520> but

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
at ten yards that wasn't a bad guess but

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.030 
at ten yards that wasn't a bad guess but
if<00:01:55.360> we<00:01:55.510> was<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.660> push<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.110> target<00:01:56.530> out<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.800> 30

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
if we was to push that target out to 30

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.880 
if we was to push that target out to 30
yards<00:01:57.490> without<00:01:57.730> changing<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.270> sights<00:01:58.890> we're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
yards without changing the sights we're

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.130 
yards without changing the sights we're
likely<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.400> go<00:02:00.910> right<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.420> outside<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:02.050> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
likely to go right to the outside of the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.560 
likely to go right to the outside of the
boss<00:02:02.320> or<00:02:02.530> even<00:02:02.620> miss<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.010> target<00:02:03.370> so<00:02:04.300> we<00:02:04.330> want

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
boss or even miss the target so we want

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.360 
boss or even miss the target so we want
to<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:04.720> sighted<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.230> at<00:02:05.350> ten<00:02:05.590> then<00:02:06.220> we're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
to get sighted in at ten then we're

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.880 
to get sighted in at ten then we're
going<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.520> push<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.850> target<00:02:07.210> back<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.619> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
going to push the target back so the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.170 
going to push the target back so the
rule<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.340> when<00:02:09.490> you're<00:02:09.640> adjusting<00:02:09.880> your

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
rule is when you're adjusting your

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.230 
rule is when you're adjusting your
sights<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.500> follow<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.310> arrow<00:02:12.550> with<00:02:13.090> your

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
sights you follow the arrow with your

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.840 
sights you follow the arrow with your
sight<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.740> arrow<00:02:14.920> has<00:02:15.160> gone<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> high<00:02:15.580> left

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
sight so the arrow has gone a high left

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.490 
sight so the arrow has gone a high left
which<00:02:16.180> means<00:02:16.420> I'm<00:02:16.570> going<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.810> move<00:02:16.990> my<00:02:17.050> sight

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
which means I'm going to move my sight

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.060 
which means I'm going to move my sight
up<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.910> left<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.650> trial<00:02:20.890> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
up and to the left and it's a trial and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.940 
up and to the left and it's a trial and
error<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.400> know<00:02:21.520> how<00:02:21.670> much<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:22.950> judging

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
error to know how much it is but judging

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.230 
error to know how much it is but judging
from<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.190> we're<00:02:24.550> going<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.730> move<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.000> sight

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
from that we're going to move the sight

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.450 
from that we're going to move the sight
up<00:02:25.480> approximately<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:26.200> centimeter<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
up approximately a centimeter and to the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.400 
up approximately a centimeter and to the
left<00:02:27.670> probably<00:02:27.910> five<00:02:28.330> millimeters<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.200> then

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
left probably five millimeters and then

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.140 
left probably five millimeters and then
we'll<00:02:29.560> see<00:02:29.740> where<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> lands<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.940> called<00:02:31.090> a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
we'll see where it lands it's called a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.550 
we'll see where it lands it's called a
micro<00:02:31.570> adjustment<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.350> site<00:02:34.560> which

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
micro adjustment on this site which

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.260 
micro adjustment on this site which
means<00:02:35.710> it's<00:02:35.920> quite<00:02:36.100> convenient<00:02:36.460> just<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.910> undo

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
means it's quite convenient just to undo

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.420 
means it's quite convenient just to undo
the<00:02:37.420> nuts<00:02:38.460> move<00:02:39.460> it<00:02:39.580> up<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.330> undo<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the nuts move it up and undo the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.680 
the nuts move it up and undo the
horizontal<00:02:42.430> one<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.850> move<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.360> sight<00:02:43.740> out

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
horizontal one and move the sight out

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.830 
horizontal one and move the sight out
much<00:02:46.690> pretty<00:02:46.989> tight

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.479 

they<00:02:50.530> might<00:02:50.800> still<00:02:50.980> need<00:02:51.250> some<00:02:51.459> more

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
they might still need some more

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.210 
they might still need some more
adjustment<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.620> will<00:02:53.769> give<00:02:53.920> us<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.099> good

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
adjustment but it will give us a good

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:07.600 
adjustment but it will give us a good
idea<00:02:54.640> what<00:02:55.599> we're<00:02:55.780> doing

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.119 

nice<00:03:08.610> central<00:03:08.970> shot<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.650> too<00:03:10.769> easy<00:03:10.950> at

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
nice central shot so it's too easy at

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.530 
nice central shot so it's too easy at
ten<00:03:11.340> let's<00:03:11.550> push<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.849> target<00:03:12.180> back<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> bit

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
ten let's push the target back a bit

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.240 
ten let's push the target back a bit
further<00:03:13.849> so<00:03:14.849> we're<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.030> twenty<00:03:15.420> yards<00:03:15.720> now<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
further so we're at twenty yards now and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.350 
further so we're at twenty yards now and
twenty<00:03:17.250> yards<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.580> probably<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.180> most

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
twenty yards is probably one of the most

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.930 
twenty yards is probably one of the most
critical<00:03:18.810> distances<00:03:19.349> for<00:03:19.530> hunting<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.700> going

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
critical distances for hunting is going

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.270 
critical distances for hunting is going
to<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> top<00:03:21.390> pin<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.830> reason<00:03:23.190> that

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
to be a top pin and the reason that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.160 
to be a top pin and the reason that
we're<00:03:23.459> using<00:03:23.700> twenty<00:03:24.180> yards<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> top<00:03:24.870> pin

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
we're using twenty yards is the top pin

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.949 
we're using twenty yards is the top pin
is<00:03:25.769> because<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.370> 10<00:03:26.640> yard<00:03:26.880> pin<00:03:27.269> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
is because to have a 10 yard pin the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.630 
is because to have a 10 yard pin the
distance<00:03:28.380> between<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.860> two<00:03:29.040> pins<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.459> so

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
distance between the two pins is so

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.430 
distance between the two pins is so
small<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.269> almost<00:03:30.569> not<00:03:30.810> worth<00:03:30.840> trying<00:03:31.260> to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
small it's almost not worth trying to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.949 
small it's almost not worth trying to
set<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> separate<00:03:32.129> pin<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.540> further<00:03:33.810> away

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
set a separate pin but the further away

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.900 
set a separate pin but the further away
you<00:03:34.080> get<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.799> bigger<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.459> spread<00:03:35.790> between

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you get the bigger the spread between

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.069 
you get the bigger the spread between
the<00:03:36.120> pin<00:03:36.390> pins<00:03:36.840> becomes<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.720> was<00:03:39.720> originally

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
the pin pins becomes so I was originally

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.069 
the pin pins becomes so I was originally
set<00:03:40.260> at<00:03:40.410> 10<00:03:40.560> yards<00:03:40.920> I'm<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.220> shoot<00:03:41.370> 20

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
set at 10 yards I'm going to shoot 20

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.449 
set at 10 yards I'm going to shoot 20
I'll<00:03:43.079> probably<00:03:43.260> expect<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.010> drop<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
I'll probably expect it to drop just a

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.580 
I'll probably expect it to drop just a
little<00:03:44.760> bit<00:03:44.880> low<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:46.110> should<00:03:46.290> be<00:03:46.380> quite

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
little bit low but it should be quite

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.550 
little bit low but it should be quite
close<00:03:46.860> still<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.310> central<00:03:48.110> let's<00:03:49.110> see<00:03:49.260> how<00:03:49.410> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
close still to central let's see how it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:02.240 
close still to central let's see how it
goes<00:04:00.110> okay<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.349> we<00:04:01.620> have<00:04:01.769> dropped<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.160> little

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
goes okay so we have dropped a little

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.039 
goes okay so we have dropped a little
bit<00:04:02.459> lower<00:04:02.670> than<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.970> thought<00:04:03.180> I'll<00:04:03.840> take

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
bit lower than a thought I'll take

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.009 
bit lower than a thought I'll take
another<00:04:04.170> shot<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.890> make<00:04:05.040> sure<00:04:05.069> it<00:04:05.430> wasn't

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
another shot just to make sure it wasn't

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:16.280 
another shot just to make sure it wasn't
human<00:04:07.019> error

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.509 

so<00:04:17.290> you<00:04:17.380> can<00:04:17.500> see<00:04:17.680> I've<00:04:17.830> got<00:04:17.950> two<00:04:18.160> shots

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
so you can see I've got two shots

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.600 
so you can see I've got two shots
virtually<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:19.180> exactly<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.720> same<00:04:19.750> place<00:04:20.140> I

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
virtually in exactly the same place I

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.430 
virtually in exactly the same place I
think<00:04:21.610> I<00:04:21.910> can<00:04:22.180> be<00:04:22.300> confidently<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.960> equipment

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
think I can be confidently the equipment

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.350 
think I can be confidently the equipment
shooting<00:04:23.830> well<00:04:24.010> there<00:04:24.610> were<00:04:24.670> two<00:04:24.820> good<00:04:25.090> shots

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
shooting well there were two good shots

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.540 
shooting well there were two good shots
that<00:04:25.510> are<00:04:25.600> made<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.830> that's<00:04:27.010> just<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.340> case<00:04:27.490> of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
that are made so that's just a case of

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:40.470 
that are made so that's just a case of
adjusting<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.120> sight<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.930> let's<00:04:29.080> have<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.260> play

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.080 

have<00:04:41.480> dropped<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:41.930> probably<00:04:42.940> three<00:04:43.940> or<00:04:43.970> four

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
have dropped that probably three or four

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.370 
have dropped that probably three or four
mil<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:45.970> there<00:04:46.970> was<00:04:47.120> marginally<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.260> the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
mil and there was marginally to the

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.910 
mil and there was marginally to the
right<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:50.290> just<00:04:51.290> bring<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.590> in<00:04:51.890> a<00:04:51.980> little<00:04:52.160> bit

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
right so just bring that in a little bit

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:04.439 
right so just bring that in a little bit
fingers<00:04:54.920> crossed<00:04:55.190> it's<00:04:55.400> going<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.640> be<00:04:55.700> okay

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.659 

I<00:05:06.990> was<00:05:07.990> getting<00:05:08.740> close<00:05:08.979> I've<00:05:09.189> caught<00:05:09.520> the

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
I was getting close I've caught the

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.119 
I was getting close I've caught the
yellow<00:05:09.999> bottom<00:05:10.509> right-hand<00:05:10.719> corner<00:05:11.349> I<00:05:11.559> need

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
yellow bottom right-hand corner I need

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:35.420 
yellow bottom right-hand corner I need
to<00:05:12.340> move<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.639> site<00:05:12.849> a<00:05:12.879> bit<00:05:13.029> more<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:13.539> right

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.950 

take<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.730> not<00:05:36.940> very<00:05:37.150> good<00:05:37.360> shot<00:05:37.690> let's

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
take that is not very good shot let's

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:51.499 
take that is not very good shot let's
have<00:05:38.110> another<00:05:38.230> one

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.970 

perfect

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
perfect

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.460 
perfect
so<00:05:54.520> that's<00:05:54.700> 20<00:05:55.090> cited<00:05:55.660> in<00:05:55.780> which<00:05:56.080> is<00:05:56.200> one<00:05:56.380> of

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
so that's 20 cited in which is one of

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.890 
so that's 20 cited in which is one of
the<00:05:56.530> most<00:05:56.680> important<00:05:57.130> distances<00:05:57.670> you<00:05:58.600> notice

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
the most important distances you notice

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.180 
the most important distances you notice
when<00:05:59.050> I<00:05:59.080> was<00:05:59.200> adjusting<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.740> site<00:05:59.950> for<00:06:00.130> the

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
when I was adjusting the site for the

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.480 
when I was adjusting the site for the
first<00:06:00.460> distance<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.180> was<00:06:01.390> moving<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.780> whole

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
first distance I was moving the whole

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.460 
first distance I was moving the whole
carriage<00:06:03.490> up<00:06:03.730> and<00:06:03.910> down<00:06:04.090> when<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.110> comes<00:06:05.260> for

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
carriage up and down when it comes for

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.290 
carriage up and down when it comes for
the<00:06:05.530> next<00:06:05.860> distances<00:06:06.460> you're<00:06:07.090> going<00:06:07.240> to

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
the next distances you're going to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.360 
the next distances you're going to
individually<00:06:07.870> move<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.200> pins<00:06:08.470> because

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
individually move the pins because

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.010 
individually move the pins because
although<00:06:09.820> they're<00:06:10.090> roughly<00:06:10.660> in<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:10.900> right

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
although they're roughly in the right

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.200 
although they're roughly in the right
place<00:06:11.320> you<00:06:11.470> need<00:06:11.590> to<00:06:11.710> fine-tune<00:06:11.980> them<00:06:12.460> so

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
place you need to fine-tune them so

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.060 
place you need to fine-tune them so
you'll<00:06:13.390> have<00:06:13.510> each<00:06:13.780> pin<00:06:14.170> individually

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
you'll have each pin individually

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.950 
you'll have each pin individually
adjusted<00:06:15.820> to<00:06:16.060> suit<00:06:16.090> the<00:06:16.360> different<00:06:16.690> distances

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
adjusted to suit the different distances

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.860 
adjusted to suit the different distances
up<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.410> 60<00:06:18.280> yards<00:06:18.700> but<00:06:19.360> that's<00:06:19.510> something<00:06:19.750> I'll

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
up to 60 yards but that's something I'll

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.500 
up to 60 yards but that's something I'll
even<00:06:20.050> to<00:06:20.500> do<00:06:20.650> I've<00:06:20.890> got<00:06:21.070> him<00:06:21.160> on<00:06:21.250> target<00:06:21.820> so

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
even to do I've got him on target so

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.180 
even to do I've got him on target so
they<00:06:22.660> make<00:06:22.960> him<00:06:23.140> if<00:06:23.260> he<00:06:23.380> loses<00:06:23.560> all<00:06:23.740> his<00:06:23.830> arrows

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
they make him if he loses all his arrows

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.250 
they make him if he loses all his arrows
or<00:06:24.310> not<00:06:24.550> but<00:06:24.820> the<00:06:25.240> bow<00:06:25.390> setting<00:06:25.750> up<00:06:25.870> set<00:06:26.140> up

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.520 
or not but the bow setting up set up
good<00:06:26.410> enough<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.740> shoot<00:06:26.920> at<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.160> target<00:06:28.530> one

good enough to shoot at the target one
other<00:06:29.710> thing<00:06:29.980> you<00:06:30.340> might<00:06:30.490> need<00:06:30.730> to<00:06:30.880> take<00:06:30.910> into

consideration<00:06:32.250> you<00:06:33.250> noticed<00:06:33.580> I<00:06:33.670> was<00:06:33.790> shooting

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
consideration you noticed I was shooting

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.120 
consideration you noticed I was shooting
the<00:06:34.300> bow<00:06:34.420> with<00:06:34.630> the<00:06:34.660> bow<00:06:35.350> quiver<00:06:35.650> attached

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
the bow with the bow quiver attached

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.330 
the bow with the bow quiver attached
fully<00:06:37.000> loaded<00:06:37.270> with<00:06:37.420> arrows<00:06:37.920> that's<00:06:38.920> because

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
fully loaded with arrows that's because

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.490 
fully loaded with arrows that's because
when<00:06:39.880> you<00:06:40.000> shoot<00:06:40.270> a<00:06:40.420> bow<00:06:40.600> with<00:06:41.020> an<00:06:41.260> arrow

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
when you shoot a bow with an arrow

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.010 
when you shoot a bow with an arrow
quiver<00:06:42.040> and<00:06:42.340> without<00:06:43.030> an<00:06:43.180> arrow<00:06:43.330> quiver<00:06:43.690> the

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
quiver and without an arrow quiver the

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.470 
quiver and without an arrow quiver the
impact<00:06:44.470> point<00:06:44.740> of<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:44.980> arrows<00:06:45.310> very<00:06:45.940> slightly

impact point of the arrows very slightly

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.270 
impact point of the arrows very slightly
on<00:06:46.600> the<00:06:46.690> target<00:06:47.140> so<00:06:47.950> when<00:06:48.070> you're<00:06:48.190> getting

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
on the target so when you're getting

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.220 
on the target so when you're getting
site<00:06:48.670> marks<00:06:49.030> for<00:06:49.270> hunting<00:06:49.690> you<00:06:49.840> should<00:06:49.990> shoot

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
site marks for hunting you should shoot

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.410 
site marks for hunting you should shoot
it<00:06:50.380> as<00:06:50.470> close<00:06:50.770> to<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:51.040> actual<00:06:51.430> conditions

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.480 
it as close to the actual conditions
that<00:06:52.570> you'll<00:06:52.690> be<00:06:52.810> using<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:53.290> bow<00:06:53.440> in<00:06:53.620> so<00:06:54.370> it

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
that you'll be using the bow in so it

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.100 
that you'll be using the bow in so it
feels<00:06:54.670> a<00:06:54.820> little<00:06:55.000> heavier<00:06:55.330> it's<00:06:55.840> a<00:06:55.870> bit<00:06:55.990> more

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110

twenty yards is the same as mine because
the<00:07:06.130> individual<00:07:06.820> archer<00:07:07.180> will<00:07:07.300> have<00:07:07.450> slight
