00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
outside and you are immediately shocked

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.929 
outside and you are immediately shocked
at<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.769> that<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.070> second<00:00:26.519> ending<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
at if that was my second ending and I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.160 
at if that was my second ending and I
thought<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.300> ending<00:00:27.689> might<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.050> been

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
thought that ending might have been

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.660 
thought that ending might have been
better<00:00:28.320> than<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.619> first<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.279> then<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.490> got

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
better than the first but then I got

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.260 
better than the first but then I got
killed<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.269> was<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.810> fucking<00:00:31.199> sucks

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
killed and I was like that fucking sucks

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.670 
killed and I was like that fucking sucks
but<00:00:33.270> yeah<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.630> definitely<00:00:33.719> liked<00:00:34.350> his<00:00:34.469> third

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
but yeah I definitely liked his third

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.650 
but yeah I definitely liked his third
ending<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.130> lot<00:00:35.340> better<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.820> finale<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.420> just

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
ending a lot better the finale was just

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
ending a lot better the finale was just
ten<00:00:36.899> times<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.290> epic<00:00:37.800> than<00:00:37.829> any<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.460> seen

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
ten times more epic than any of my seen

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.810 
thousand I bury him at 3,100 kind of
crazy<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.810> yeah<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.320> guess<00:03:10.220> I'm<00:03:10.400> good<00:03:10.610> at<00:03:10.700> this

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
crazy but yeah I guess I'm good at this

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.130 
crazy but yeah I guess I'm good at this
video<00:03:11.240> thing

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.840 

I'm<00:03:18.140> glad<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.770> you<00:03:19.130> guys<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.700> way<00:03:19.820> I

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
I'm glad that you guys like the way I

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.480 
I'm glad that you guys like the way I
did<00:03:20.090> commentary<00:03:20.630> for<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.050> game<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.500> could

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
did commentary for this game I could

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.100 
did commentary for this game I could
have<00:03:22.610> talked<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.940> lot<00:03:23.090> more<00:03:23.360> but<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.690> figured

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
have talked a lot more but I figured

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.840 
have talked a lot more but I figured
this<00:03:24.320> game<00:03:24.530> does<00:03:24.830> not<00:03:25.010> need<00:03:25.190> commentary

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
this game does not need commentary

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.940 
this game does not need commentary
really<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.780> would<00:03:26.990> it<00:03:27.320> just<00:03:27.500> takes<00:03:27.650> away<00:03:27.890> from

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
really it would it just takes away from

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.800 
really it would it just takes away from
the<00:03:28.100> story<00:03:28.430> I've<00:03:29.150> got<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.360> few<00:03:29.510> complaints

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
the story I've got a few complaints

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.870 
the story I've got a few complaints
about<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.410> guess<00:03:30.650> dark<00:03:30.890> side<00:03:31.100> chill<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.670> maybe

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
about I guess dark side chill and maybe

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.730 
about I guess dark side chill and maybe
a<00:03:32.150> couple<00:03:32.450> other<00:03:32.660> people<00:03:32.990> I'm<00:03:33.170> not<00:03:33.290> sure<00:03:33.500> about

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
a couple other people I'm not sure about

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.230 
a couple other people I'm not sure about
how<00:03:34.250> they<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:34.580> talk<00:03:34.790> through<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:35.090> whole

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
how they just talk through the whole

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.630 
how they just talk through the whole
story<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.050> just<00:03:36.380> takes<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> seriousness

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
story and it just takes the seriousness

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.180 
story and it just takes the seriousness
out<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:39.230> definitely<00:03:39.709> didn't<00:03:40.100> want

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
out of it and I definitely didn't want

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.270 
out of it and I definitely didn't want
to<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.060> that's<00:03:41.540> why<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.870> rarely<00:03:42.830> talk

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
to do that so that's why I rarely talk

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.220 
to do that so that's why I rarely talk
in<00:03:43.459> these<00:03:43.580> videos<00:03:43.760> but<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.240> think<00:03:44.510> that's<00:03:45.110> the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
in these videos but I think that's the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.920 
in these videos but I think that's the
way<00:03:45.320> it<00:03:45.440> should<00:03:45.500> be<00:03:45.650> done<00:03:46.780> there<00:03:47.780> are<00:03:47.840> some

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
way it should be done there are some

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.510 
way it should be done there are some
games<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.620> know<00:03:48.740> you<00:03:48.800> can<00:03:49.340> use

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
games that you know you can use

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.350 
games that you know you can use
commentary<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:50.570> others<00:03:51.230> not<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:51.560> much

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
commentary on and others not so much

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.650 
commentary on and others not so much
games<00:03:53.360> focus<00:03:53.900> on<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.140> story<00:03:55.420> that's<00:03:56.420> just

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
games focus on the story that's just

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.340 
games focus on the story that's just
annoying<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.410> me<00:03:57.440> at<00:03:57.739> least<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:59.230> be<00:04:00.230> like

with it but I'll eventually get it
because<00:04:32.830> I'm<00:04:33.010> Pro<00:04:33.400> like<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:34.500> not<00:04:35.500> really

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
because I'm Pro like that not really

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.310 
because I'm Pro like that not really
anyway<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.640> could<00:04:37.330> either<00:04:37.570> start<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.110> tonight

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
anyway I could either start that tonight

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.200 
anyway I could either start that tonight
or<00:04:38.920> I<00:04:38.950> could<00:04:39.760> do<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.420> heavy<00:04:40.630> rain<00:04:40.960> step<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:43.180> I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
or I could do the heavy rain step so I

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.580 
or I could do the heavy rain step so I
guess<00:04:43.420> I'll<00:04:43.570> leave<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.780> up<00:04:43.840> for<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.050> guys<00:04:44.110> even

guess I'll leave it up for you guys even

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.960 
guess I'll leave it up for you guys even

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
though it's probably going to be a bias

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.420
