00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
weight forward you rock back once the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
weight forward you rock back once the
hitting<00:01:26.880> arm<00:01:27.180> reaches<00:01:27.630> parallel<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.590> that's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
hitting arm reaches parallel here that's

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.130 
hitting arm reaches parallel here that's
where<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:30.119> loop<00:01:30.360> happens<00:01:30.900> right

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
where this little loop happens right

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
where this little loop happens right
here<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> come<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.270> loop

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
here so you come down you just loop

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.530 
here so you come down you just loop
around<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.860> again<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.540> notice

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
around and go that way again and notice

toss<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.160> ball<00:02:26.310> super<00:02:26.880> high<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:28.459> when<00:02:29.459> you

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
toss the ball super high but when you

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.910 
toss the ball super high but when you
toss<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.120> ball<00:02:30.269> out<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.750> your<00:02:30.930> reach<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.590> have

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
toss the ball out of your reach you have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.789 
toss the ball out of your reach you have
to<00:02:32.069> wait<00:02:32.280> for<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.610> ball<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.819> come<00:02:33.120> down<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.799> the

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
to wait for the ball to come down as the

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.820 
to wait for the ball to come down as the
ball<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.069> dropping<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:36.690> picking<00:02:37.350> up<00:02:37.530> speed

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
ball is dropping it's picking up speed

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.660 
ball is dropping it's picking up speed
at<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.000> rate<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.360> gravity<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.190> let's<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.459> say

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
at the rate of gravity so let's just say

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.729 
at the rate of gravity so let's just say
this<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:42.060> as<00:02:42.239> high<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:43.019> reach<00:02:43.230> right<00:02:43.530> now

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
this is as high as I can reach right now

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.670 
this is as high as I can reach right now
now<00:02:44.459> if<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.730> toss<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.330> ball<00:02:45.480> way<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:46.080> here<00:02:46.530> I

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
now if I toss the ball way up here I

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.640 
now if I toss the ball way up here I
have<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.670> wait<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.540> come<00:02:48.870> down<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.319> here

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
have to wait for it to come down to here

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.880 
have to wait for it to come down to here
before<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.370> hit<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.810> now<00:02:51.810> if<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> ball<00:02:52.739> is

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
before I can hit it now if the ball is

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.750 
before I can hit it now if the ball is
up<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:54.180> ball<00:02:54.360> stops<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.989> midair<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:56.610> it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
up here the ball stops in midair then it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.699 
up here the ball stops in midair then it
starts<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.209> drop<00:02:57.330> at<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.780> rate<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.080> gravity

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
starts to drop at the rate of gravity

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.890 
starts to drop at the rate of gravity
but<00:02:59.130> as<00:02:59.280> its<00:02:59.519> dropping<00:02:59.850> it's<00:03:00.299> picking<00:03:00.750> up

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
but as its dropping it's picking up

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.069 
but as its dropping it's picking up
speed<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:02.579> by<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.880> time<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.510> gets<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.989> your

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
speed so by the time it gets to your

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.740 
speed so by the time it gets to your
hitting<00:03:04.530> zone<00:03:04.769> over<00:03:05.130> here<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:06.390> ball<00:03:06.630> is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
hitting zone over here the ball is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.740 
hitting zone over here the ball is
moving<00:03:06.780> fast<00:03:07.489> it's<00:03:08.489> moving<00:03:08.910> fast<00:03:09.269> through

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
moving fast it's moving fast through

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.020 
moving fast it's moving fast through
your<00:03:09.959> hitting<00:03:10.260> zone<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.370> don't<00:03:11.400> want<00:03:11.790> that

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
your hitting zone you don't want that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.680 
your hitting zone you don't want that
now<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.370> toss<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> peak<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.510> your

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
now if you just toss to the peak of your

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.539 
now if you just toss to the peak of your
reach<00:03:15.930> let's<00:03:16.290> say<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> racket<00:03:16.980> right<00:03:17.130> now<00:03:17.370> is

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
reach let's say the racket right now is

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.880 
reach let's say the racket right now is
at<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.760> peak<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.060> my<00:03:18.120> reach<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.380> just<00:03:19.680> toss

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
at the peak of my reach if I just toss

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.580 
at the peak of my reach if I just toss
the<00:03:20.130> ball<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.570> ball<00:03:21.780> stops<00:03:22.320> in

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the ball to here the ball stops in

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.490 
the ball to here the ball stops in
midair<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.670> split<00:03:24.090> second<00:03:24.630> then<00:03:25.350> it

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
midair for that split second then it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500 
midair for that split second then it
starts<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:26.070> drop<00:03:26.340> at<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.609> rate<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.910> gravity

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
starts to drop at the rate of gravity

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.890 
starts to drop at the rate of gravity
but<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.690> dropping<00:03:28.109> slower<00:03:28.799> here<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:30.510> it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
but it's dropping slower here so it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.770 
but it's dropping slower here so it
hasn't<00:03:31.290> picked<00:03:31.470> up<00:03:31.620> speed<00:03:32.100> yet<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.450> stops

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
hasn't picked up speed yet so it stops

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.569 
hasn't picked up speed yet so it stops
there<00:03:34.109> starts<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.799> drop<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.190> still<00:03:35.430> hasn't

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
there starts the drop it still hasn't

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.420 
there starts the drop it still hasn't
picked<00:03:35.820> up<00:03:35.970> speed<00:03:36.500> it's<00:03:37.500> been<00:03:37.769> proven<00:03:38.250> when

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
picked up speed it's been proven when

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.449 
picked up speed it's been proven when
you<00:03:38.609> toss<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.200> peak<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.739> your<00:03:40.859> reach<00:03:41.160> this

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
you toss to the peak of your reach this

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.750 
you toss to the peak of your reach this
is<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.640> proven<00:03:42.150> fact<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:43.380> actually<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.190> 10

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
is a proven fact you actually have 10

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.309 
is a proven fact you actually have 10
times<00:03:45.319> more<00:03:46.319> time<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:47.459> hit<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.760> ball<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.319> many

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
times more time to hit the ball and many

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.130 
times more time to hit the ball and many
times<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.890> know<00:03:49.980> all<00:03:50.040> here<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.930> friend<00:03:51.930> of

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
times you know all here a friend of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.629 
times you know all here a friend of
somebody<00:03:52.530> out<00:03:52.680> there<00:03:52.920> having<00:03:53.130> trouble<00:03:53.549> with

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
somebody out there having trouble with

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.220 
somebody out there having trouble with
their<00:03:53.790> serve<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.450> they'll<00:03:54.540> say<00:03:54.750> toss<00:03:55.019> it

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
their serve and they'll say toss it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.949 
their serve and they'll say toss it
higher<00:03:55.470> as<00:03:55.829> if<00:03:56.549> tossing<00:03:57.060> higher<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.569> cure

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
higher as if tossing higher is the cure

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.770 
higher as if tossing higher is the cure
for<00:03:58.019> everything<00:03:58.590> it's<00:03:59.010> not<00:03:59.359> okay<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.720> only

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
for everything it's not okay so the only

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.729 
for everything it's not okay so the only
thing<00:04:01.319> I'm<00:04:01.470> concentrating<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.400> right<00:04:02.670> now<00:04:02.910> is

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
thing I'm concentrating on right now is

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.039 
thing I'm concentrating on right now is
hitting<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.890> ball<00:04:05.099> at<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:06.000> peak<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.599> the

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
hitting the ball at the peak of the

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.920 
hitting the ball at the peak of the
reach<00:04:07.319> when<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.250> ball<00:04:08.459> stops<00:04:08.879> for<00:04:09.780> that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
reach when the ball stops for that

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.610 
reach when the ball stops for that

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
here the toss is out in front at that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.120 
here the toss is out in front at that
one<00:04:35.040> o'clock<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:36.139> I'm<00:04:37.139> leaning<00:04:37.380> in<00:04:37.710> right<00:04:37.919> now

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
one o'clock and I'm leaning in right now

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.939 
one o'clock and I'm leaning in right now
you'll<00:04:38.370> see<00:04:38.580> as<00:04:38.699> I<00:04:38.880> fall<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.449> on<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.750> finish<00:04:39.990> so

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
you'll see as I fall in on the finish so

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:47.800 
you'll see as I fall in on the finish so
that's<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.370> peak<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:41.880> reach<00:04:42.090> right<00:04:42.419> there

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.150 

remember<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.320> ball<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.740> in<00:04:49.770> your

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
remember that the ball is in your

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.360 
remember that the ball is in your
hitting<00:04:50.460> zone<00:04:50.760> ten<00:04:51.360> times<00:04:51.720> longer<00:04:52.050> on<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.530> toss

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
hitting zone ten times longer on a toss

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.890 
hitting zone ten times longer on a toss
just<00:04:53.699> to<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.910> peak<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.300> your<00:04:54.419> reach<00:04:54.660> that

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
just to the peak of your reach that

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.200 
just to the peak of your reach that
makes<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.320> serve<00:04:55.560> easier<00:04:56.070> it's<00:04:56.699> not<00:04:57.030> as

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
makes the serve easier it's not as

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.320 
makes the serve easier it's not as
difficult<00:04:57.449> tip<00:04:58.050> number<00:04:58.229> four<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:59.820> have<00:04:59.850> if

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
difficult tip number four you have if

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.629 
difficult tip number four you have if
you<00:05:00.510> really<00:05:00.930> want<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.199> develop<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.889> sword

people are doing this now if you keep
the<00:05:46.139> palm<00:05:46.380> of<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.590> hand<00:05:46.800> down<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.099> you<00:05:47.460> have<00:05:47.669> a

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
the palm of the hand down and you have a

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.900 
the palm of the hand down and you have a
continental<00:05:48.330> grip<00:05:48.590> this<00:05:49.590> allows<00:05:50.099> the<00:05:50.430> racket

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
continental grip this allows the racket

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.810 
continental grip this allows the racket
to<00:05:51.120> form<00:05:51.449> that<00:05:51.750> perfect<00:05:52.410> loop<00:05:52.710> see<00:05:53.610> when<00:05:53.729> you

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
to form that perfect loop see when you

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.659 
to form that perfect loop see when you
come<00:05:54.060> back<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.960> hand<00:05:55.199> is<00:05:55.349> down<00:05:55.560> now<00:05:56.340> you're

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
come back the hand is down now you're

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.939 
come back the hand is down now you're
coming<00:05:57.030> around<00:05:57.180> and<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:58.020> see<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.440> loop<00:05:58.740> is

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
coming around and the see the loop is

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.580 
coming around and the see the loop is
happening<00:05:59.430> right<00:05:59.580> here<00:05:59.639> down<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:00.990> then

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
happening right here down and then

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.020 
happening right here down and then
you're<00:06:01.800> coming<00:06:02.039> up<00:06:02.370> so<00:06:04.460> throwing<00:06:05.460> motion<00:06:05.880> is

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
you're coming up so throwing motion is

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.469 
you're coming up so throwing motion is
absolutely<00:06:06.990> key<00:06:07.280> so<00:06:08.280> what<00:06:08.550> I'd<00:06:08.699> suggest<00:06:08.729> is

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
absolutely key so what I'd suggest is

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.300 
absolutely key so what I'd suggest is
you<00:06:10.199> know<00:06:10.320> just<00:06:10.650> going<00:06:10.889> to<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.280> baseline<00:06:11.820> and

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
you know just going to the baseline and

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.890 
you know just going to the baseline and
turning<00:06:14.310> sideways<00:06:14.669> as<00:06:15.240> if<00:06:15.419> you're<00:06:15.599> serving

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
turning sideways as if you're serving

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.469 
turning sideways as if you're serving
and<00:06:16.460> just<00:06:17.460> bring<00:06:18.120> your<00:06:18.270> hands<00:06:18.570> back

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
and just bring your hands back

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.899 
and just bring your hands back
like<00:06:21.479> you're<00:06:21.629> gonna<00:06:21.719> serve<00:06:22.110> here<00:06:23.069> come<00:06:23.729> up

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
like you're gonna serve here come up

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.639 
like you're gonna serve here come up
with<00:06:24.059> the<00:06:24.179> hands<00:06:24.599> and<00:06:24.749> then<00:06:25.020> just<00:06:25.349> throw<00:06:25.619> a

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.649 
with the hands and then just throw a

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:26.689 
with the hands and then just throw a
ball<00:06:25.919> over<00:06:26.129> the<00:06:26.369> net

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
ball over the net

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.540 
ball over the net
so<00:06:26.819> you're<00:06:26.999> here<00:06:27.270> and<00:06:27.479> you're<00:06:28.409> throwing<00:06:28.709> okay

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
so you're here and you're throwing okay

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.399 
so you're here and you're throwing okay
so<00:06:30.509> you<00:06:30.569> learn<00:06:31.050> that<00:06:31.289> throwing<00:06:31.709> motion<00:06:32.429> and

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
so you learn that throwing motion and

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.799 
so you learn that throwing motion and
just<00:06:34.409> practice<00:06:35.099> that<00:06:35.659> remember<00:06:36.659> you're

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:36.809 
just practice that remember you're

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:40.820 
just practice that remember you're
turning<00:06:37.439> your<00:06:37.589> shoulders<00:06:38.239> here<00:06:39.649> rotating<00:06:40.649> and

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
turning your shoulders here rotating and

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.259 
turning your shoulders here rotating and
then<00:06:41.069> rotate<00:06:41.669> around

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:42.269 
then rotate around

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.949 
then rotate around
if<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.779> palm<00:06:43.019> stays<00:06:43.379> down<00:06:44.269> once<00:06:45.269> the<00:06:45.719> arm

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:45.959 
if the palm stays down once the arm

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:49.189 
if the palm stays down once the arm
reaches<00:06:46.469> horizontal<00:06:47.249> here<00:06:47.719> just<00:06:48.719> let<00:06:48.959> the

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
reaches horizontal here just let the
