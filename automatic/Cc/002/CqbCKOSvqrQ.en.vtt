00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
yourself up for scratching is in the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.269 
yourself up for scratching is in the
software<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> look<00:00:23.039> at<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
software we're going to look at the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.429 
software we're going to look at the
deduced<00:00:23.670> software<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.930> Virtual<00:00:25.289> DJ

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
deduced software and the Virtual DJ

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.830 
deduced software and the Virtual DJ
software<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.640> let's<00:00:26.789> go<00:00:27.060> into<00:00:27.269> those<00:00:27.390> settings

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
software so let's go into those settings

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.929 
software so let's go into those settings
straight<00:00:28.289> away<00:00:28.470> okay<00:00:29.369> firstly<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
straight away okay firstly in the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.930 
straight away okay firstly in the
control<00:00:30.390> panel<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.529> unit<00:00:32.219> itself<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
control panel for the unit itself the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.290 
control panel for the unit itself the
our<00:00:33.090> mx2<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.530> main<00:00:34.980> tab<00:00:35.370> two<00:00:35.969> things<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
our mx2 on the main tab two things you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.190 
our mx2 on the main tab two things you
need<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.989> jog<00:00:37.800> wheel<00:00:38.059> settings

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
need to have here jog wheel settings

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.709 
need to have here jog wheel settings
sensitivity<00:00:40.430> needs<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.670> set<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.120> normal

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
sensitivity needs to be set at normal

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.720 
sensitivity needs to be set at normal
that's<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> find<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> works<00:00:43.710> best<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that's how I find it works best and the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
that's how I find it works best and the
crossfader<00:00:45.239> settings<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:46.350> sure<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
crossfader settings make sure that is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000 
crossfader settings make sure that is
set<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> scratch<00:00:48.000> curve<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> need

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
set to scratch curve that's all you need

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.610 
set to scratch curve that's all you need
to<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> deduced<00:00:52.079> software

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
to do there then in the deduced software

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.939 
to do there then in the deduced software
itself<00:00:53.059> go<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.829> configure<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
itself go up here to configure the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.900 
itself go up here to configure the
settings<00:00:57.050> audio<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> sample<00:00:58.800> rate<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.280> forty

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
settings audio the sample rate at forty

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
settings audio the sample rate at forty
four<00:01:00.180> point<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:01.020> kilohertz<00:01:01.350> or<00:01:01.680> forty<00:01:02.070> four

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
four point one kilohertz or forty four

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.750 
four point one kilohertz or forty four
100<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.650> then<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.100> only<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
100 and then the only other thing you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
100 and then the only other thing you
need<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> look<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.720> mixer<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
need to look at here is mixer and this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.429 
need to look at here is mixer and this
is<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> crossfader<00:01:08.729> curve<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.689> find<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is the crossfader curve I find that the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
is the crossfader curve I find that the
scratch<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.040> works<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.580> fine<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
scratch one works just fine but if you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.440 
scratch one works just fine but if you
want<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.110> custom<00:01:13.760> custom<00:01:14.760> draw<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.180> curve

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
want you can custom custom draw a curve

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
want you can custom custom draw a curve
there<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> scratch<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.500> works<00:01:17.189> just

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
there but the scratch one works just

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
there but the scratch one works just
great<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> there<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.380> that's<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
great so there you go that's what you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.859 
great so there you go that's what you
need<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> deegeu<00:01:21.060> software<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> get

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
need to do in the deegeu software to get

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.420 
need to do in the deegeu software to get
you<00:01:21.990> set<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.380> scratching<00:01:22.860> let's<00:01:23.130> look<00:01:23.340> at

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you set up for scratching let's look at

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940 
you set up for scratching let's look at
Virtual<00:01:23.850> DJ<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.470> okay<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:25.830> in

go as low as your system can cope with
before<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.060> starts<00:01:39.360> sounding<00:01:39.540> strange<00:01:40.110> then

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
before it starts sounding strange then

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.340 
before it starts sounding strange then
