percentage by 125 percent but you're

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.290 
percentage by 125 percent but you're
also<00:02:06.270> boosting<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:07.619> friends<00:02:08.039> by<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.550> 100

so<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:09.989> four<00:02:10.170> friends<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
so if your four friends have it then you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.589 
so if your four friends have it then you
get<00:02:11.129> an<00:02:11.220> extra<00:02:11.310> hundred<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.910> top<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.360> it's

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
get an extra hundred on top of that it's

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.640 
get an extra hundred on top of that it's
really<00:02:12.690> really<00:02:13.290> cool

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
really really cool

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
really really cool
so<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.220> battle<00:02:14.370> boost<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.940> won't<00:02:15.180> completely

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so the battle boost all won't completely

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.240 
so the battle boost all won't completely

tracking<00:04:26.980> how<00:04:27.730> many<00:04:27.760> 60-minute<00:04:28.360> games<00:04:28.540> there

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
tracking how many 60-minute games there

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.260 
tracking how many 60-minute games there
are<00:04:28.900> how<00:04:29.290> often<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:30.160> theis<00:04:30.400> GPM<00:04:30.880> is<00:04:31.030> things

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
are how often the theis GPM is things

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.670 
are how often the theis GPM is things
like<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.570> number<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:31.930> Heroes<00:04:32.200> Pikmin<00:04:32.530> been

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
like that number of Heroes Pikmin been

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.960 
like that number of Heroes Pikmin been
you<00:04:32.860> could<00:04:32.980> look<00:04:33.070> up<00:04:33.220> pretty<00:04:33.400> easily<00:04:33.580> as<00:04:33.820> well

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
you could look up pretty easily as well

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.310 
you could look up pretty easily as well
as<00:04:34.060> most<00:04:34.210> picked<00:04:34.540> here<00:04:34.630> on<00:04:34.780> most<00:04:34.960> banned<00:04:35.140> here

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
as most picked here on most banned here

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.500 
as most picked here on most banned here
things<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.550> are<00:04:36.700> definitely<00:04:37.090> possible

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
things like that are definitely possible

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.450 
things like that are definitely possible
to<00:04:37.810> figure<00:04:38.020> out<00:04:38.140> but<00:04:38.620> also<00:04:38.800> it's<00:04:39.100> gonna<00:04:39.280> track

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
to figure out but also it's gonna track

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.740 
to figure out but also it's gonna track
your<00:04:39.610> prediction<00:04:39.970> score<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:40.390> assume<00:04:40.600> there

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
your prediction score so I assume there

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.060 
your prediction score so I assume there
will<00:04:40.840> be<00:04:40.870> like<00:04:41.110> an<00:04:41.230> overall<00:04:41.530> rating<00:04:41.800> or

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
will be like an overall rating or

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.260 
will be like an overall rating or
something<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:42.460> see<00:04:42.580> who<00:04:42.670> did<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.910> best<00:04:43.000> and

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
something and see who did the best and

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.220 
something and see who did the best and
they'll<00:04:43.360> get<00:04:43.480> some<00:04:43.660> like<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.810> really<00:04:44.020> fancy

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
they'll get some like a really fancy

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.690 
they'll get some like a really fancy
item<00:04:44.560> that's<00:04:44.710> my<00:04:44.830> assumption<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.430> don't<00:04:45.640> know

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
item that's my assumption I don't know

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.280 
item that's my assumption I don't know
if<00:04:45.820> that's<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.060> fact<00:04:46.270> but<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:47.020> fact<00:04:47.230> that

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
if that's a fact but the fact that

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.660 
if that's a fact but the fact that
attracts<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.950> it's<00:04:48.040> gonna<00:04:48.160> be<00:04:48.310> pretty<00:04:48.520> much

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
attracts and it's gonna be pretty much

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.010 
attracts and it's gonna be pretty much
like<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.880> bracket<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.390> pretty<00:04:49.780> sweet

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
like a bracket is pretty sweet

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.990 
like a bracket is pretty sweet
same<00:04:50.500> thing<00:04:50.710> for<00:04:50.740> Eastern<00:04:51.250> qualifier<00:04:51.730> cuz

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
same thing for Eastern qualifier cuz

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.030 
same thing for Eastern qualifier cuz
they<00:04:52.240> play<00:04:52.450> slightly<00:04:52.810> different<00:04:53.170> so<00:04:53.800> there's

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
they play slightly different so there's

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.850 
they play slightly different so there's
gonna<00:04:54.160> be<00:04:54.250> more<00:04:54.490> information<00:04:54.670> for<00:04:55.060> that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
gonna be more information for that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.140 
gonna be more information for that
here's<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.010> courier<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.670> his<00:04:57.820> regular

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
here's the courier this is his regular

here's the courier this is his regular
mode<00:04:58.360> if<00:04:58.600> um<00:04:59.290> yeah<00:04:59.740> this<00:04:59.860> is<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.130> all-star

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
mode if um yeah this is the all-star

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.500 
mode if um yeah this is the all-star
match<00:05:00.610> thing<00:05:00.820> it's<00:05:00.940> pretty<00:05:01.150> cool

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
match thing it's pretty cool

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.820 
match thing it's pretty cool
um<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:01.780> just<00:05:01.810> kind<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.110> picked<00:05:02.320> random<00:05:02.620> players

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
um I just kind of picked random players

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.950 
um I just kind of picked random players
that<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:03.160> like<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:04.240> basically<00:05:04.570> there's<00:05:04.810> gonna

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
that I like but basically there's gonna

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.900 
that I like but basically there's gonna
be<00:05:05.110> an<00:05:05.170> all-star<00:05:05.320> match<00:05:05.700> during<00:05:06.700> the

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
be an all-star match during the

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.150 
be an all-star match during the
International<00:05:07.480> lead-up<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:08.170> to<00:05:08.650> dream<00:05:08.860> teams

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
International lead-up so to dream teams

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.830 
International lead-up so to dream teams
I<00:05:09.370> assume<00:05:09.730> what<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.240> gonna<00:05:10.360> do<00:05:10.630> is

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
I assume what this is gonna do is

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.380 
I assume what this is gonna do is
they'll<00:05:11.080> just<00:05:11.260> pick<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:12.790> players<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.330> are

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
they'll just pick the players that are

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.690 
they'll just pick the players that are
most<00:05:13.660> often<00:05:13.960> placed<00:05:14.620> in<00:05:14.800> each<00:05:15.070> category<00:05:15.640> and

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
most often placed in each category and

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.190 
most often placed in each category and
then<00:05:16.000> they'll<00:05:16.150> have<00:05:16.270> an<00:05:16.390> all-star<00:05:16.750> match<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.170> I

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
then they'll have an all-star match so I

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.450 
then they'll have an all-star match so I
just<00:05:17.440> like<00:05:17.560> picked<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.860> bunch<00:05:17.980> of<00:05:18.100> players<00:05:18.310> that

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
just like picked a bunch of players that

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.180 
just like picked a bunch of players that
I'm<00:05:18.700> friends<00:05:18.970> with<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:19.740> yeah<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.770> think<00:05:21.070> this

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
I'm friends with and yeah I think this

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.470 
I'm friends with and yeah I think this
team<00:05:21.370> would<00:05:21.460> be<00:05:21.520> cool<00:05:21.820> and<00:05:21.850> then<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.240> picked

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
team would be cool and then I picked

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.910 
team would be cool and then I picked
like<00:05:22.600> a<00:05:22.660> bunch<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:22.960> really<00:05:23.230> good<00:05:23.380> people<00:05:23.560> from

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
like a bunch of really good people from

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.590 
like a bunch of really good people from
different<00:05:24.100> teams<00:05:24.430> who<00:05:24.910> don't<00:05:25.120> speak<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.450> same

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
different teams who don't speak the same

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.810 
different teams who don't speak the same
language

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
language

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.460 
language
look<00:05:28.330> a<00:05:28.390> bunch<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.630> Chinese<00:05:28.810> people<00:05:29.110> had<00:05:29.350> to

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
look a bunch of Chinese people had to

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.650 
look a bunch of Chinese people had to
play<00:05:29.650> with<00:05:30.030> people<00:05:31.030> that<00:05:31.180> did<00:05:31.330> not<00:05:31.450> speak

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
play with people that did not speak

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.020 
play with people that did not speak
Chinese<00:05:31.990> or<00:05:32.260> Mandarin<00:05:32.740> or<00:05:32.860> whatever<00:05:33.070> anyways

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
Chinese or Mandarin or whatever anyways

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.910 
Chinese or Mandarin or whatever anyways
so<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.810> all-star<00:05:35.260> match<00:05:35.290> it's<00:05:35.560> pretty<00:05:35.740> cool

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
so the all-star match it's pretty cool

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.530 
so the all-star match it's pretty cool
81<00:05:36.430> days<00:05:36.580> until<00:05:36.850> you<00:05:37.030> have<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.300> choose<00:05:37.510> that
