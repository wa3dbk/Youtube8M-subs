can<00:01:52.570> be<00:01:52.660> really<00:01:52.870> simple<00:01:53.080> like<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.350> again

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
can be really simple like that again

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.440 
can be really simple like that again
could<00:01:54.280> be<00:01:54.340> very<00:01:54.580> fun<00:01:55.440> CeeLo
