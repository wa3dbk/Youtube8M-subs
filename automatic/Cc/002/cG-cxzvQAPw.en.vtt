00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.430
 lady, we're back and look 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.590
 now let's do something very very father 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.900
 because it is that all the photos 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.709
 claudia welcome by the way 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.049
 welcome 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.830
 hey cloud does not happen to you that suddenly already 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.929
 we no longer have this beautiful habit 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.410
 to have the photographs at home because 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:25.080
 already the world is very digitized very 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.869
 well digitized and it's there from my 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 cell that has already lost all that wave 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.949
 of the photos but today we want to make a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.219
 rescue of all these pretty 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.600
 traditions and beautiful memories like this is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.120
 claudia that we are going to do what I 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.550
 I always say is if you have something in a while 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.399
 then the photograph if they are inside 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.649
 from a bag or inside a box that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.050
 you are not entering your memories 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.000
 then I bring a very parent dynamic 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.610
 that the only thing that becomes very simple 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.600
 you need is 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.950
 folder ok this folder have to 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.290
 find a piece of cloth 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.370
 so that they are of that size and what 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.820
 what they do is paste 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.390
 with liquid silicone ok and this to go 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.790
 forming one with the balls a collage of 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.159
 photos then look for the end of how 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.830
 we are going to send because my compaÃ±eras 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.210
 Machito and Amaranta are going to be 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.890
 doing at the same time so that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.500
 you realize how easy and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.899
 fun that is is not a very dynamic 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.149
 father because you can also count on 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.040
 know more about if he wants I like 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.780
 that you like to eat you arrive with your 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.090
 relatives or with your friends and they 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.670
 Share your best unless they are part 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.210
 from them they brought some very parents photos 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.090
 because they are photos that bring them very 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.700
 Beautiful memories define them 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 as people by their family for their 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 friends for many 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.030
 I was hungry 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.030
 but I would leave her my sisters 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.240
 Erendira and Mayra Kelly 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.900

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.930
 beautiful memories and in this way 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.269

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.900
 continuous father of this is that in a 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.330
 same moment our creativity that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.060

 that more topics that we can more 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.570
 imposing on that album an activity or 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.880
 It can be complemented with different 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.600
 accessories for example here we have 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.820

 cut out little things from sentences in the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.990
 newspaper and in magazines then you see 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.050
 as very very father and always remember 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.510
 have everything organized with a label 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.910

 I would like him to go over the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.920
 work of my colleagues and I think 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.740
 that is very father very very very 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.470
 father because they are very creative at 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.810
 you like flowers lady who is 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.760
 and the first lists we started them 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.810
 put in it something this life I have it 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.120
 you can use these sheets that are 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.790
 transparent they are appended to the something 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.340
 and also to protect the photos ok 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.950
 but this one is very beautiful, it 's period 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.410
 I finished it very nice 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.140
 I do not like this amaranta that everyone 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.860
 did you do as same tones as 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.810
 monochrome I like 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.500
 have clues 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.800
 eating meditating on the tube would be 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.560
 very nice that ladies or children girls 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.720
 the magnets also decide to 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.360
 do this kind of projects send us 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.150
 to our twitter is above you see how 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.520
 the project was already finished, not and if 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.009
 it was easy for them to do it if they were not 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.680
 made easy hey clear some tips 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.690
 no longer so as for that we 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.789
 there is left is always very 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.460
 important that they use products that do not 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:19.120
 have toxins so your photos do not 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.639
 are affected or over time they are not 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.550
 nothing will suit us 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.590
 find many things like with 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.720
 creativity do not need to be 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.900
 buying in those specialized stores 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.710
 what they can do is cut 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.889
 I remember all the newsletter of the cinema with 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.440
 the boyfriend and you can paste it there or some 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.150
 entrance to the theater all that becomes 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.220
 part of your memories and you can put it 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.060
 here and if they manage to do things 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.250
 wonderful look here I have to do 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.190
 actions use for people who have 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.050
 problems of the tents 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.920
 they happen to them like some of the things 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.920
 what they liked best 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.390
 as therapies that just remember very 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.770
 cute I really have it every year 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.630
 of my life and they repair it 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.900
 all the pieces of paper that you give me then 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.880
 I'm leaving I'm going to give the homework 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.520
 make a project like that and I'm going to 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.040
 teach later thanks for joining us 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.600
 today very well to these two 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.600
 beautiful has worked 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.740
 at home under the regime and with pau 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.169
 I live those two girls that barber 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.000
 for our cool christmas gifts 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.520
 and I think it's a very good idea, right? 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.190
 simple and cheap truth is margarit 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.680
 maticas 10 and hear now if the 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.240
 moment of entering and of knowing a 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.039
 little bit more of the history of English 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.380
 crowned fears big this woman is 

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:51.720
 a mere warrior and I think we're going to 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.699
 know of current some stages of the 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.240
 life of indies crowned a woman with 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.729
 claw let's see 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.470
 ingrid coronado is undoubtedly one of the 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:02.599
 most emblematic faces of the 

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.210
 Mexican television during its 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:07.639
 personal and professional growth 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:10.009
 suffered highs and lows but a stage that 

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:12.250
 undoubtedly marked it was adolescence and 

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:12.250
 what
