clogged the follicle gets clogged with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
clogged the follicle gets clogged with
stuff<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> pulls<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> then

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
stuff in it so it pulls it out and then

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
stuff in it so it pulls it out and then
increase<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> circulation<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> scalp

increase the circulation for the scalp

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.490 
increase the circulation for the scalp

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and then it helps to hear that's there

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.899 
and then it helps to hear that's there
