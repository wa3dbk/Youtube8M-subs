00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.499 
SmartWatch they're trying to kind of
reinvent<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.500> modern<00:01:19.799> timepiece<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.580> i

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
reinvent the modern timepiece and i

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.700 
reinvent the modern timepiece and i
would<00:01:21.659> say<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.439> pretty<00:01:22.619> much

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
would say you know they pretty much

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
would say you know they pretty much
accomplished<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.729> looks<00:01:23.970> alone<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
accomplished it just on looks alone I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.230 
accomplished it just on looks alone I
guess<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> unique<00:01:25.920> aspect<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.000> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
guess the unique aspect about this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.090 
guess the unique aspect about this
SmartWatch<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> fact<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
SmartWatch is the fact that it's got a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.450 
SmartWatch is the fact that it's got a
circular<00:01:29.670> display<00:01:30.500> now<00:01:31.500> there's<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
circular display now there's a kind of a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
circular display now there's a kind of a
raised<00:01:32.700> glass<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.329> don't<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.810> able<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
raised glass I don't think I be able to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
raised glass I don't think I be able to
pick<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.439> camera<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> can

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
pick it up on camera there but you can

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.160 
pick it up on camera there but you can
see<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> has<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
see here it kind of it has like a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.469 
see here it kind of it has like a
beveled<00:01:37.560> edge<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> kind<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.299> does

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
beveled edge and what that kind of does

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.260 
beveled edge and what that kind of does
is<00:01:39.869> mask<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.920> fact<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.460> pixels<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
is mask the fact that there are pixels I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
is mask the fact that there are pixels I
guess<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.380> jaggies<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.130> little<00:01:44.340> stair

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
guess like jaggies like little stair

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.980 
guess like jaggies like little stair
steps<00:01:44.880> along<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> side<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> device<00:01:45.780> it's

pretty<00:01:46.409> genius<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:48.450> again<00:01:48.810> there's<00:01:48.930> really

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
pretty genius but again there's really

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
pretty genius but again there's really

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.020 
darn amazing and awesome also inside of
the<00:05:20.690> box<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:21.169> get<00:05:21.410> see<00:05:22.400> what<00:05:22.520> else<00:05:22.640> is<00:05:22.850> in<00:05:22.880> here

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
the box you get see what else is in here

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.560 
the box you get see what else is in here
just<00:05:23.540> a<00:05:23.950> standard<00:05:24.950> wall<00:05:25.160> charger<00:05:25.669> which

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
just a standard wall charger which

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.390 
just a standard wall charger which
apparently<00:05:26.840> isn't<00:05:27.229> a<00:05:27.380> USB<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.919> just<00:05:28.130> seems<00:05:28.280> to

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
apparently isn't a USB it just seems to

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.140 
apparently isn't a USB it just seems to
be<00:05:28.540> connected<00:05:29.770> hardwired<00:05:30.770> in<00:05:30.950> today<00:05:31.250> and<00:05:31.460> then

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
be connected hardwired in today and then

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.460 
be connected hardwired in today and then
a<00:05:32.210> microdose<00:05:32.510> be<00:05:32.720> on<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.870> other<00:05:32.930> side<00:05:33.050> there

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
a microdose be on the other side there

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.030 
a microdose be on the other side there
so<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.979> guess<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.060> is<00:05:35.090> just<00:05:35.300> a<00:05:36.010> real<00:05:37.010> quick

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
so I guess that is just a real quick

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.370 
so I guess that is just a real quick
look<00:05:37.400> at<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.640> middle<00:05:37.880> 360<00:05:38.300> any<00:05:38.780> questions<00:05:39.169> rep

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
look at the middle 360 any questions rep

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.659 
look at the middle 360 any questions rep
I<00:05:39.560> don't<00:05:39.770> know<00:05:39.830> well<00:05:40.010> I<00:05:40.070> think<00:05:40.160> that<00:05:40.430> part<00:05:40.640> of

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
I don't know well I think that part of

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:41.800 
I don't know well I think that part of
the<00:05:40.789> reason<00:05:40.820> that's<00:05:41.150> like<00:05:41.330> that<00:05:41.510> is<00:05:41.630> because

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
the reason that's like that is because

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.360 
the reason that's like that is because
they<00:05:41.930> anticipate<00:05:42.380> you<00:05:42.470> put<00:05:42.680> this<00:05:42.800> by<00:05:42.979> your<00:05:43.010> bed

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
they anticipate you put this by your bed

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.830 
they anticipate you put this by your bed
so<00:05:43.610> you'll<00:05:43.760> always<00:05:43.940> keep<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.419> plugged<00:05:44.600> in

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
so you'll always keep it plugged in

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.990 
so you'll always keep it plugged in
there<00:05:45.050> which<00:05:45.860> is<00:05:45.979> right<00:05:46.460> because<00:05:46.640> it<00:05:46.789> turns

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
there which is right because it turns

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.270 
there which is right because it turns
into<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.360> clock<00:05:47.570> one<00:05:47.870> yeah<00:05:48.500> yeah<00:05:48.860> that's<00:05:49.039> true

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
into the clock one yeah yeah that's true

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.909 
into the clock one yeah yeah that's true
it's<00:05:49.880> nice<00:05:50.030> would<00:05:50.390> you<00:05:50.570> which<00:05:51.169> are<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.680> bands

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
it's nice would you which are the bands

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.380 
it's nice would you which are the bands

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140

so<00:06:26.960> it<00:06:27.050> comes<00:06:27.169> in<00:06:27.289> the<00:06:27.350> black<00:06:27.560> this<00:06:27.979> is<00:06:28.190> a<00:06:28.340> all

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
so it comes in the black this is a all

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.340 
so it comes in the black this is a all
black<00:06:29.000> version<00:06:29.600> and<00:06:29.810> then<00:06:29.930> there's<00:06:30.050> a<00:06:30.110> silver

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
black version and then there's a silver

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.650 
black version and then there's a silver
version<00:06:30.620> which<00:06:30.950> has<00:06:30.979> the<00:06:31.280> gray<00:06:31.520> leather<00:06:32.270> strap

version which has the gray leather strap

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.610 
version which has the gray leather strap
so<00:06:32.990> which<00:06:33.229> would<00:06:33.409> you<00:06:33.470> get

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
so which would you get

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.719 
so which would you get
probably<00:06:35.620> the<00:06:35.979> more<00:06:36.100> actually<00:06:36.340> the<00:06:36.430> gray<00:06:36.550> one

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
probably the more actually the gray one

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.700 
probably the more actually the gray one
the<00:06:36.759> more<00:06:36.940> I<00:06:37.000> like<00:06:37.180> it<00:06:37.210> but<00:06:37.479> I<00:06:37.539> feel<00:06:37.720> like<00:06:37.870> the

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
the more I like it but I feel like the

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.770 
the more I like it but I feel like the
black<00:06:38.889> one<00:06:38.919> it<00:06:39.850> probably<00:06:40.180> sits<00:06:40.419> a<00:06:40.479> little<00:06:40.569> bit

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
black one it probably sits a little bit

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.090 
black one it probably sits a little bit
more<00:06:41.169> well<00:06:41.350> with<00:06:41.530> me<00:06:41.680> I<00:06:41.710> like<00:06:41.860> the<00:06:41.979> whole

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
more well with me I like the whole

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.830 
more well with me I like the whole
murdered<00:06:42.430> outlook<00:06:42.759> I<00:06:43.000> think<00:06:43.300> it<00:06:43.389> hides<00:06:43.599> the

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
murdered outlook I think it hides the

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.320 
murdered outlook I think it hides the
thing<00:06:44.830> on<00:06:44.949> the<00:06:45.009> bottom<00:06:45.130> as<00:06:45.400> well<00:06:45.430> better<00:06:45.819> do<00:06:46.090> a

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
thing on the bottom as well better do a

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.210 
thing on the bottom as well better do a
little<00:06:46.990> ambient<00:06:47.410> there's<00:06:47.860> a<00:06:47.949> little<00:06:48.069> light

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
little ambient there's a little light

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.469 
little ambient there's a little light
there<00:06:48.280> at<00:06:48.520> the<00:06:48.610> bottom<00:06:48.729> it's<00:06:48.970> a<00:06:49.090> heart<00:06:49.330> rate

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
there at the bottom it's a heart rate

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.290 
there at the bottom it's a heart rate
alright<00:06:50.319> since<00:06:50.500> a<00:06:50.650> thing<00:06:50.860> yeah<00:06:51.610> what's<00:06:52.090> cool
