00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
good side Victoria they're probably the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.720 
good side Victoria they're probably the
benchmark<00:00:11.959> and<00:00:12.080> the<00:00:12.170> competition<00:00:12.710> and<00:00:12.950> now<00:00:13.670> we

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
benchmark and the competition and now we

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
probably used came up a little bit short

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.440 
probably used came up a little bit short
today<00:00:15.500> with<00:00:15.769> under<00:00:16.369> pressure<00:00:16.610> le<00:00:16.880> with<00:00:17.119> losing

today with under pressure le with losing

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.910 
today with under pressure le with losing
too<00:00:17.570> many<00:00:17.630> wickets<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.230> sort<00:00:18.650> of<00:00:18.680> had<00:00:18.800> this

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
too many wickets and sort of had this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.800 
too many wickets and sort of had this
sort<00:00:19.099> of<00:00:19.160> fight<00:00:19.340> a<00:00:19.400> way<00:00:19.640> out<00:00:19.849> of<00:00:19.939> it<00:00:20.060> which<00:00:20.270> is

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
sort of fight a way out of it which is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.240 
sort of fight a way out of it which is
an<00:00:20.960> ideal<00:00:21.820> 2:47<00:00:22.820> probably<00:00:23.859> probably<00:00:24.859> yeah

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
an ideal 2:47 probably probably yeah

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.679 
an ideal 2:47 probably probably yeah
yeah<00:00:25.640> it's<00:00:25.789> probably<00:00:26.119> not<00:00:26.269> enough<00:00:27.039> yeah<00:00:28.689> isn't

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
yeah it's probably not enough yeah isn't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.590 
yeah it's probably not enough yeah isn't
it<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:29.810> mean<00:00:32.019> it's<00:00:33.019> a<00:00:33.110> tough<00:00:33.320> one

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
it I mean it's a tough one

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.110 
it I mean it's a tough one
yeah<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:35.809> was<00:00:36.199> probably<00:00:36.320> 20<00:00:36.769> or<00:00:36.860> 30<00:00:37.070> short<00:00:37.370> on

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
yeah it was probably 20 or 30 short on

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.170 
yeah it was probably 20 or 30 short on
these<00:00:38.449> conditions<00:00:38.690> but<00:00:39.260> um<00:00:39.850> yeah<00:00:40.850> especially

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
these conditions but um yeah especially

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.670 
these conditions but um yeah especially
when<00:00:41.479> you've<00:00:41.570> got<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.690> player<00:00:42.260> like<00:00:42.409> Hodge

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
when you've got a player like Hodge

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.630 
when you've got a player like Hodge
about<00:00:43.580> in<00:00:43.729> his<00:00:44.360> class<00:00:44.659> act<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.460> we<00:00:46.460> probably

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
about in his class act and we probably

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.700 
about in his class act and we probably
gave<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.210> couple<00:00:47.479> of<00:00:47.659> chances<00:00:48.080> away<00:00:48.229> with<00:00:48.559> them

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
gave a couple of chances away with them

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.899 
gave a couple of chances away with them
run<00:00:48.949> outs<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.280> things<00:00:49.339> like<00:00:49.519> that<00:00:49.580> and<00:00:49.790> if<00:00:49.850> we

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
run outs and things like that and if we

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.160 
run outs and things like that and if we
could<00:00:50.030> have<00:00:50.119> taken<00:00:50.239> them<00:00:50.479> it<00:00:50.629> would<00:00:50.750> they<00:00:50.989> may

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
could have taken them it would they may

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.329 
could have taken them it would they may
have<00:00:51.290> been<00:00:51.409> a<00:00:51.440> different<00:00:51.769> story<00:00:51.830> but<00:00:52.190> I'll

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
have been a different story but I'll

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.979 
have been a different story but I'll
just<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.580> bit<00:00:52.699> too<00:00:52.790> good<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:53.089> a<00:00:53.119> night<00:00:53.330> you

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
just a bit too good of a night you

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.689 
just a bit too good of a night you
mentioned<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.500> loss<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.949> early<00:00:55.280> wickets

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
mentioned the loss of the early wickets

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.369 
mentioned the loss of the early wickets
is<00:00:55.909> that<00:00:56.089> something<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:56.449> was<00:00:56.690> family<00:00:57.140> never

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
is that something that was family never

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.229 
is that something that was family never
had<00:00:57.680> when<00:00:57.920> he<00:00:57.949> came<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:58.549> the<00:00:58.670> crease<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.150> you

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
had when he came to the crease it you

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.759 
had when he came to the crease it you
really<00:00:59.449> had<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.600> stick<00:00:59.960> things<00:01:00.229> up<00:01:00.470> would<00:01:00.650> be

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
really had to stick things up would be

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.390 
really had to stick things up would be
yeah<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.549> little<00:01:02.000> bit<00:01:02.119> definitely<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:03.049> think<00:01:03.619> the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
yeah a little bit definitely I think the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.480 
yeah a little bit definitely I think the
previous<00:01:04.610> couple<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:05.000> games<00:01:05.180> I'd<00:01:05.479> probably

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
previous couple of games I'd probably

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.160 
previous couple of games I'd probably
been<00:01:07.490> in<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.670> bit<00:01:07.820> too<00:01:07.970> much<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.330> rush<00:01:08.540> there's

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
been in a bit too much of a rush there's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.640 
been in a bit too much of a rush there's
a<00:01:09.260> lot<00:01:09.980> of<00:01:10.100> time<00:01:10.250> in<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.490> 50<00:01:10.790> over<00:01:10.970> again<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:12.440> I

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
a lot of time in a 50 over again and I

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.050 
a lot of time in a 50 over again and I
probably<00:01:12.860> gave<00:01:13.220> myself<00:01:13.400> a<00:01:13.640> bit<00:01:13.790> more<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.030> a

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
probably gave myself a bit more of a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.330 
probably gave myself a bit more of a
chance<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.780> look<00:01:14.960> early<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.950> ball<00:01:16.130> was

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
chance to have a look early the ball was

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.620 
chance to have a look early the ball was
actually<00:01:16.670> swinging<00:01:17.030> around<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.330> bit<00:01:17.450> nail

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
actually swinging around a bit nail

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.340 
actually swinging around a bit nail
balling<00:01:17.960> particularly<00:01:18.380> well<00:01:18.590> early<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.600> we

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
balling particularly well early and we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.600 
balling particularly well early and we
just<00:01:21.530> had<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.740> sort<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:21.980> dig<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.340> for<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.520> little

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
just had to sort of dig in for a little

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.460 
just had to sort of dig in for a little
while<00:01:22.730> get<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.000> partnership<00:01:23.510> going<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.350> was

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
while get a partnership going and it was

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.320 
while get a partnership going and it was
fortunate<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:24.980> had<00:01:25.280> Daniel<00:01:25.910> Christian

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
fortunate that had Daniel Christian

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.880 
fortunate that had Daniel Christian
battered<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:26.780> well<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:27.410> managed<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.710> get<00:01:27.860> a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
battered so well and we managed to get a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.860 
battered so well and we managed to get a
bit<00:01:28.040> of<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.160> partnership<00:01:28.430> going<00:01:28.700> there<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.210> for

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
bit of a partnership going there and for

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.140 
bit of a partnership going there and for
a<00:01:29.900> while<00:01:30.110> there<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.440> looked<00:01:30.500> like<00:01:30.740> 275<00:01:31.700> sort<00:01:32.090> of

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
a while there it looked like 275 sort of

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.630 
a while there it looked like 275 sort of
was<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.480> cards<00:01:32.870> but<00:01:33.100> just<00:01:34.100> lost<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.370> wicket

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
was on the cards but just lost a wicket

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.760 
was on the cards but just lost a wicket
at<00:01:34.760> an<00:01:35.090> unfortunate<00:01:35.840> time<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.590> didn't

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
at an unfortunate time and and we didn't

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.500 
at an unfortunate time and and we didn't
quite<00:01:36.890> get<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.250> satisfying<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.150> get<00:01:38.300> your

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
quite get that satisfying to get your

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.750 
quite get that satisfying to get your
higher<00:01:38.960> score<00:01:39.409> but<00:01:39.650> perhaps<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.400> little<00:01:40.430> bit

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
higher score but perhaps a little bit

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.670 
higher score but perhaps a little bit
disappointing<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.510> wasn't<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.870> ton<00:01:42.110> yeah

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
disappointing it wasn't a ton yeah

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.460 
disappointing it wasn't a ton yeah
definitely<00:01:43.310> um<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:44.030> know<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.600> think<00:01:45.260> we

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
definitely um you know I think we

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.110 
definitely um you know I think we
probably<00:01:45.680> could<00:01:45.920> have<00:01:46.010> got<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:47.000> know

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
probably could have got you know

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.190 
probably could have got you know
especially<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.810> from<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.990> team

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
especially for that from a team

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.240 
especially for that from a team
perspective<00:01:48.229> we<00:01:48.680> probably<00:01:48.890> could<00:01:49.070> have<00:01:49.100> got

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
perspective we probably could have got

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.850 
perspective we probably could have got
10<00:01:49.460> or<00:01:49.580> 15<00:01:49.909> more<00:01:50.150> I<00:01:50.810> just<00:01:51.050> couldn't<00:01:51.620> even<00:01:51.650> off

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
10 or 15 more I just couldn't even off

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.590 
10 or 15 more I just couldn't even off
the<00:01:51.920> square<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.460> last<00:01:52.670> five<00:01:52.909> or<00:01:52.940> six<00:01:53.150> overs

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
the square in the last five or six overs

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.980 
the square in the last five or six overs
so<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:54.409> don't<00:01:54.979> know<00:01:55.040> what<00:01:55.190> happened<00:01:55.520> there<00:01:55.700> but

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
so I don't know what happened there but

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.300 
so I don't know what happened there but
you<00:01:56.990> know<00:01:57.110> would<00:01:57.229> have<00:01:57.350> been<00:01:57.470> nice<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.740> get<00:01:57.950> 100

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
you know would have been nice to get 100

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.980 
you know would have been nice to get 100
but<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:59.090> would<00:01:59.180> have<00:01:59.240> been<00:01:59.390> nice<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.810> team

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
but it would have been nice to the team

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.200 
but it would have been nice to the team
to<00:02:00.140> get<00:02:00.260> to<00:02:00.320> 70<00:02:00.860> plus<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:01.340> well<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:02.030> just

better<00:02:31.560> yeah<00:02:32.560> definitely<00:02:33.160> tidy<00:02:33.850> sort<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.239> got

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
better yeah definitely tidy sort of got

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.990 
better yeah definitely tidy sort of got
better<00:02:34.569> every<00:02:34.870> time<00:02:34.900> he's<00:02:35.260> bold<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.680> think<00:02:36.000> it's

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
better every time he's bold I think it's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.520 
better every time he's bold I think it's
always<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.300> good<00:02:37.570> song<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.900> milady<00:02:38.140> when<00:02:38.410> you're

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
always a good song I milady when you're

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.380 
always a good song I milady when you're
starting<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.890> swing<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.280> out<00:02:39.550> early<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.239> then

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
starting to swing it out early and then

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.729 
starting to swing it out early and then
when<00:02:40.480> he<00:02:40.570> comes<00:02:40.750> back<00:02:40.930> later<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.380> swings

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
when he comes back later on and swings

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.729 
when he comes back later on and swings
it<00:02:41.920> into<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.700> right<00:02:42.880> hands<00:02:43.320> reversing<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.440> so

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
it into the right hands reversing it so

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.430 
it into the right hands reversing it so
I<00:02:44.950> think<00:02:45.220> he's<00:02:45.430> starting<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.880> do<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.440> play

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
I think he's starting to do that play

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.750 
I think he's starting to do that play
club<00:02:47.739> cricket<00:02:48.040> with<00:02:48.160> him<00:02:48.250> as<00:02:48.370> well<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.640> he's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
club cricket with him as well and he's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.820 
club cricket with him as well and he's
bold<00:02:48.970> some<00:02:49.150> really<00:02:49.420> really<00:02:49.510> good<00:02:49.750> spells<00:02:50.110> this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
bold some really really good spells this

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.160 
bold some really really good spells this
season<00:02:51.190> for<00:02:51.310> Stewart<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.840> know<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.959> think

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
season for Stewart and you know I think

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.600 
season for Stewart and you know I think
he's<00:02:53.290> getting<00:02:53.440> better<00:02:53.709> every<00:02:53.890> time<00:02:54.100> he<00:02:54.400> bowls

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
he's getting better every time he bowls

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.610 
he's getting better every time he bowls
so<00:02:54.880> hopefully<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.720> mentoring

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
so hopefully and that mentoring

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.840 
so hopefully and that mentoring
performance<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.190> only<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.580> around<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
performance is only just around the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.759 
performance is only just around the
corner<00:02:58.120> rolling<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.630> came<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:58.900> tonight<00:02:59.500> and

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
corner rolling it came on tonight and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.210 
corner rolling it came on tonight and
three<00:03:00.160> separate<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:02.170> he<00:03:02.290> doing<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.739> same<00:03:02.980> as

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
three separate is he doing the same as

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.949 
three separate is he doing the same as
that<00:03:03.459> means<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.910> sort<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.690> KTM

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that means that sort of a KTM

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.870 
that means that sort of a KTM
yeah<00:03:07.959> definitely<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.560> think<00:03:08.670> he's<00:03:09.670> definitely

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
yeah definitely I think he's definitely

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.819 
yeah definitely I think he's definitely
a<00:03:10.120> strike<00:03:10.390> bowling<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.079> you<00:03:11.230> probably<00:03:11.410> do<00:03:11.620> use

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
a strike bowling and you probably do use

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.580 
a strike bowling and you probably do use
them<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.040> shorter<00:03:12.400> spurts<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.590> particularly

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
them in shorter spurts and particularly

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.470 
them in shorter spurts and particularly
early<00:03:15.160> if<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.640> swinging<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.090> might<00:03:16.269> give

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
early if it is swinging you might give

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.000 
early if it is swinging you might give
him<00:03:16.600> an<00:03:16.720> extra<00:03:16.900> over<00:03:17.320> or<00:03:17.380> two<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:17.709> as<00:03:17.799> soon<00:03:17.920> as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
him an extra over or two but as soon as

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.380 
him an extra over or two but as soon as
it<00:03:18.130> stops<00:03:18.340> swinging<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.730> probably<00:03:18.970> save<00:03:19.209> him

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
it stops swinging you probably save him

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.270 
it stops swinging you probably save him
up<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.630> little<00:03:19.780> bit<00:03:19.959> for<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.200> new<00:03:20.380> batter<00:03:20.590> or<00:03:20.829> four

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
up a little bit for a new batter or four

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.039 
up a little bit for a new batter or four
when<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.459> starts<00:03:21.760> reversing<00:03:22.000> because<00:03:22.900> he's

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
when it starts reversing because he's

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.750 
when it starts reversing because he's
such<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.230> weapon<00:03:23.500> without<00:03:23.739> light<00:03:24.100> on<00:03:24.310> meaning

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
such a weapon without light on meaning

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.080 
such a weapon without light on meaning
so<00:03:25.500> yeah<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.530> think<00:03:26.860> he<00:03:27.340> was<00:03:27.459> used<00:03:27.670> pretty<00:03:27.880> well

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
so yeah I think he was used pretty well

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.000 
so yeah I think he was used pretty well
tonight<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.570> that's<00:03:28.660> certainly<00:03:28.959> how<00:03:29.260> we've

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
tonight and that's certainly how we've

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.030 
tonight and that's certainly how we've
been<00:03:30.160> using

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
been using

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.910 
been using
so<00:03:31.159> we<00:03:31.610> could<00:03:31.790> he<00:03:32.360> was<00:03:32.480> ingested<00:03:33.049> -<00:03:33.230> yeah

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
so we could he was ingested - yeah

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.459 
so we could he was ingested - yeah
beautiful<00:03:34.219> delivery<00:03:34.670> yeah<00:03:35.000> yeah<00:03:35.510> would<00:03:36.379> have

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:36.469 
beautiful delivery yeah yeah would have

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.080 
beautiful delivery yeah yeah would have
been<00:03:36.590> nice<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.890> have<00:03:37.099> one<00:03:37.310> or<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:37.579> more<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.819> them

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
been nice to have one or so more of them

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.420 
been nice to have one or so more of them
but<00:03:38.299> um<00:03:38.510> yeah<00:03:39.230> that's<00:03:39.439> a<00:03:39.620> great<00:03:39.739> sign<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.280> not

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
but um yeah that's a great sign to not

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.979 
but um yeah that's a great sign to not
go<00:03:40.549> over<00:03:40.730> top<00:03:40.879> layer<00:03:41.120> like<00:03:41.329> I'll<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.629> earlier

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
go over top layer like I'll see earlier

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.940 
go over top layer like I'll see earlier
I'm<00:03:42.049> not<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.489> very<00:03:43.489> good<00:03:43.670> sign<00:03:43.930> hopefully<00:03:44.950> keep

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
I'm not a very good sign hopefully keep

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.420 
I'm not a very good sign hopefully keep
going

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
going

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.920 
going
you<00:03:46.700> mentioned<00:03:47.000> earlier<00:03:47.239> taking<00:03:47.659> your<00:03:47.750> time

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
you mentioned earlier taking your time

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.539 
you mentioned earlier taking your time
with<00:03:47.989> your<00:03:48.260> own<00:03:48.409> do<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.040> think<00:03:49.250> that's<00:03:49.400> a

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
with your own do you think that's a

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.130 
with your own do you think that's a
problem<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.000> other<00:03:50.359> that's<00:03:50.599> been<00:03:50.780> finding

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
problem that other that's been finding

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.099 
problem that other that's been finding
in<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.739> lineup<00:03:52.189> that<00:03:52.220> perhaps<00:03:52.670> they're<00:03:53.109> too

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
in the lineup that perhaps they're too

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.809 
in the lineup that perhaps they're too
eager<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:56.470> maybe<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.650> think<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.280> intentions

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
eager to maybe I think the intentions

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.879 
eager to maybe I think the intentions
are<00:03:58.939> really<00:03:59.209> good<00:03:59.420> the<00:04:00.049> guys<00:04:00.079> are<00:04:00.409> going<00:04:00.769> at

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
are really good the guys are going at

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:01.809 
are really good the guys are going at
they're<00:04:01.010> looking<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.310> be<00:04:01.459> really<00:04:01.730> really

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
they're looking to be really really

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.300 
they're looking to be really really
positive<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:03.530> probably<00:04:03.859> just<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:04.069> matter<00:04:04.099> of

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
positive it's probably just a matter of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.589 
positive it's probably just a matter of
picking<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.730> right<00:04:04.879> ball<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.329> things<00:04:05.480> like

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
picking the right ball and things like

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.190 
picking the right ball and things like
that<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:07.099> know<00:04:07.220> sometimes<00:04:07.639> you're<00:04:08.329> so<00:04:08.900> close

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
that you know sometimes you're so close

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.890 
that you know sometimes you're so close
to<00:04:09.709> nailing<00:04:10.069> it<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.639> it's<00:04:10.819> a<00:04:10.939> game<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.209> it's<00:04:11.810> a

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
to nailing it and it's a game of it's a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.250 
to nailing it and it's a game of it's a
game<00:04:12.079> of<00:04:12.109> millimeters<00:04:12.799> type<00:04:13.010> things<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:14.260> but

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
game of millimeters type things so but

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.379 
game of millimeters type things so but
yeah<00:04:15.620> we<00:04:16.039> did<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.430> we<00:04:16.669> have<00:04:16.789> discussed<00:04:17.030> that

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
yeah we did this we have discussed that

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.999 
yeah we did this we have discussed that
and<00:04:17.570> it's<00:04:18.229> something<00:04:18.349> that<00:04:18.560> we're<00:04:18.799> sort<00:04:18.979> of

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
and it's something that we're sort of

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.439 
and it's something that we're sort of
going<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.250> look<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.549> revise<00:04:19.849> maybe<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.269> little

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
going to look to revise maybe a little

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.510 
going to look to revise maybe a little
bit<00:04:20.660> we<00:04:21.470> still<00:04:21.709> want<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.889> guys<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.099> go<00:04:22.310> out<00:04:22.340> and

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
bit we still want the guys to go out and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.710 
bit we still want the guys to go out and
be<00:04:22.580> really<00:04:22.849> positive<00:04:23.030> but<00:04:23.449> it's<00:04:23.570> probably

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
be really positive but it's probably

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.120 
be really positive but it's probably
just<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:24.020> matter<00:04:24.169> of<00:04:24.259> picking<00:04:24.470> their<00:04:24.740> ball<00:04:24.949> and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
just a matter of picking their ball and

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.580 
just a matter of picking their ball and
being<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.310> fracture<00:04:25.820> more<00:04:25.970> precise<00:04:26.410> with<00:04:27.410> them

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
being a fracture more precise with them

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.110 
being a fracture more precise with them
the<00:04:27.830> ball<00:04:27.949> that<00:04:28.130> they<00:04:28.220> choose<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.610> hit<00:04:28.789> and<00:04:28.940> and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
the ball that they choose to hit and and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.850 
the ball that they choose to hit and and
really<00:04:29.570> executing<00:04:30.080> this<00:04:30.169> feel<00:04:30.410> well<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:36.380> think

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
really executing this feel well I think

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.469 
really executing this feel well I think
he's<00:04:36.979> a<00:04:37.010> reasonable<00:04:37.490> chance<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.970> come<00:04:38.120> back<00:04:38.270> in

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
he's a reasonable chance to come back in

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.839 
he's a reasonable chance to come back in
time<00:04:38.659> I<00:04:39.110> haven't<00:04:39.440> really<00:04:39.800> only<00:04:40.280> spoke<00:04:40.639> to<00:04:40.729> him

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
time I haven't really only spoke to him

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.879 
time I haven't really only spoke to him
briefly<00:04:41.000> before<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.599> game<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.020> he's<00:04:42.500> hoping

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
briefly before the game and he's hoping

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.760 
briefly before the game and he's hoping
to<00:04:42.949> be<00:04:43.099> ready<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.550> Sunday<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.840> guess<00:04:45.560> it's

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
to be ready for Sunday so I guess it's

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.110 
to be ready for Sunday so I guess it's
just<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.949> matter<00:04:46.130> of<00:04:46.250> how<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.520> comes<00:04:46.699> up<00:04:46.880> in<00:04:47.060> the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
just a matter of how it comes up in the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.580 
just a matter of how it comes up in the
next<00:04:47.270> couple<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.599> days<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.500> know

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
next couple of days and you know

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.230 
next couple of days and you know
hopefully<00:04:48.800> hopefully<00:04:49.460> we'll<00:04:49.760> be<00:04:49.820> getting

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
hopefully hopefully we'll be getting

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.879 
hopefully hopefully we'll be getting
raring<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.570> go<00:04:50.690> if<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.139> were<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.500> me<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:51.830> I

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
raring to go if you were to me so I

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.689 
raring to go if you were to me so I
guess<00:04:55.900> yeah<00:04:56.900> perhaps<00:04:57.169> but<00:04:57.650> um<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.280> know<00:04:58.340> it's

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
guess yeah perhaps but um you know it's

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.560 
guess yeah perhaps but um you know it's
sort<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.030> out<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.240> my<00:04:59.360> hand<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:01.000> yeah<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.449> know

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
sort of out of my hand so yeah you know

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.939 
sort of out of my hand so yeah you know
