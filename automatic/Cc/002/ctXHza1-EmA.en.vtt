eleven<00:01:29.430> gems<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:31.110> doesn't<00:01:31.290> make<00:01:31.530> sense

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
eleven gems what this doesn't make sense

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it didn't really make that much of a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
it didn't really make that much of a
difference<00:01:41.430> unless<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.119> said<00:01:42.299> twelve<00:01:42.630> gems
