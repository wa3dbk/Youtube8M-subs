00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
take them all of them that's almost five

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
take them all of them that's almost five
thousand<00:00:26.340> abyssal<00:00:26.580> webs<00:00:26.880> holy<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.750> think

thousand abyssal webs holy I think

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.439 
thousand abyssal webs holy I think
I<00:00:28.109> spent<00:00:28.470> approximately<00:00:29.039> 1<00:00:29.640> billion<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.269> these

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I spent approximately 1 billion on these

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
I spent approximately 1 billion on these
items<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.109> I'm<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> price<00:00:31.920> check

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
items so I'm going to do a price check

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.670 
items so I'm going to do a price check
it's<00:00:32.690> probably<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:34.050> accurate<00:00:34.290> because

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it's probably not accurate because

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
it's probably not accurate because
prices<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> moment

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
prices go up and down so at the moment

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.560 
prices go up and down so at the moment
it<00:00:37.350> shows<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.860> spent<00:00:38.250> close<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> 1<00:00:39.329> billion

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it shows that I spent close to 1 billion

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.630 
it shows that I spent close to 1 billion
I<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.530> spent<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.010> bit<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.309> than

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
I think I spent a little bit more than

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
I think I spent a little bit more than
that<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.300> 1<00:00:42.510> point<00:00:42.690> 1<00:00:42.840> bill<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.320> something<00:00:43.559> like

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that of 1 point 1 bill or something like

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.920 
that of 1 point 1 bill or something like
that<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> update<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930

and<00:01:54.390> you're<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> corrupt<00:01:55.110> whip

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
and you're going to get a corrupt whip

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.950 
and you're going to get a corrupt whip
straight<00:01:55.470> away<00:01:55.590> alright<00:01:55.799> cool

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
straight away alright cool

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
straight away alright cool
but<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.829> also<00:01:59.009> give<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.579> vine<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.390> vine

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
but you can also give the vine the vine

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.590 
but you can also give the vine the vine
whip<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.530> actual<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:03.210> three<00:02:03.509> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
whip and the actual this all three of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
whip and the actual this all three of
them<00:02:03.689> together<00:02:03.840> has<00:02:04.680> given<00:02:04.979> us<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.280> percent

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
them together has given us a percent

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.859 
them together has given us a percent
charge<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.180> pretty<00:02:06.270> easily<00:02:06.450> once<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
charge so it's pretty easily once you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.809 
charge so it's pretty easily once you
shuffle<00:02:07.290> lights<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.649> gets<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> charge<00:02:08.310> 20%

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
shuffle lights on it gets the charge 20%

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.639 
shuffle lights on it gets the charge 20%
per<00:02:08.970> staff<00:02:09.179> light<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:10.349> 50<00:02:10.590> percent

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
per staff light so it's 50 percent

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
per staff light so it's 50 percent

Anna<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.830> modeling<00:02:29.570> yeah<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.320> whole

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
Anna like modeling yeah so the whole

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.080 
Anna like modeling yeah so the whole
idea<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:31.980> update<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.610> make<00:02:32.850> all<00:02:33.060> of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
idea of this update is to make all of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.880 
idea of this update is to make all of
those<00:02:33.330> three<00:02:33.720> items<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.770> price

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
those three items go up in price

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.680 
those three items go up in price
eventually<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:36.000> right<00:02:36.240> now<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.660> are

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
eventually because right now they are

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.479 
eventually because right now they are
quite<00:02:37.020> cheap<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.560> those<00:02:38.070> who<00:02:38.220> are<00:02:38.310> doing

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
quite cheap and those who are doing

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.809 
quite cheap and those who are doing
Slayer<00:02:38.880> they<00:02:39.180> don't<00:02:39.390> profit<00:02:39.810> as<00:02:39.959> much<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.819> so

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
Slayer they don't profit as much and so

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.059 
Slayer they don't profit as much and so
they<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.840> go<00:02:42.989> up<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.650> I'm<00:02:43.770> pretty

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
they just have to go up so I'm pretty

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.910 
they just have to go up so I'm pretty
sure<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.820> was<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> very<00:02:45.360> safe

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
sure that this was a very safe

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.340 
sure that this was a very safe
investment<00:02:46.920> from<00:02:47.489> my<00:02:47.610> part<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.209> hopefully<00:02:49.110> I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
investment from my part and hopefully I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.890 
investment from my part and hopefully I
could<00:02:49.709> maybe<00:02:49.980> double<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.300> would<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.480> nice

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
could maybe double it that would be nice

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.560 
could maybe double it that would be nice
so<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.380> invested<00:02:52.980> one<00:02:53.190> point<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:53.640> bill<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.090> could

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
so I invested one point one bill I could

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.860 
so I invested one point one bill I could
get<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:55.019> max<00:02:55.890> cash<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:57.090> would<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:57.420> nice<00:02:57.600> and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
get like max cash that would be nice and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.810 
get like max cash that would be nice and
ever<00:02:57.989> actually<00:02:58.320> handed<00:02:58.860> before<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.700> only

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
ever actually handed before the only

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.030 
ever actually handed before the only
problem<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:01.019> is<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.320> we<00:03:01.800> had

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
problem that I can see is that we had

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.940 
problem that I can see is that we had
Slayer<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.880> what<00:03:03.120> ten<00:03:03.540> years<00:03:03.570> now<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:04.830> had

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
Slayer for what ten years now so we had

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.580 
Slayer for what ten years now so we had
abyssal<00:03:05.280> webs<00:03:05.640> for<00:03:06.120> ten<00:03:06.390> years<00:03:06.750> which<00:03:07.320> means

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
abyssal webs for ten years which means

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.650 
abyssal webs for ten years which means
from<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.430> those<00:03:08.550> ten<00:03:08.820> years<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
from all of those ten years all of the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.420 
from all of those ten years all of the
abyssal<00:03:09.989> waves<00:03:10.260> still<00:03:10.560> exists<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.160> game

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
abyssal waves still exists in the game

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.820 
abyssal waves still exists in the game
so<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.180> may<00:03:12.390> take<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.690> few<00:03:12.870> months<00:03:13.410> before<00:03:13.560> we

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
so it may take a few months before we

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.979 
so it may take a few months before we
can<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.220> any<00:03:14.430> impact<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> prices<00:03:15.630> of

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
can see any impact on the prices of

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.650 
can see any impact on the prices of
those<00:03:16.140> webs<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:17.220> bows<00:03:17.519> probably<00:03:18.480> not

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
those webs and that bows probably not
