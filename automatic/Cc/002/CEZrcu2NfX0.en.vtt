the most difficult that you've competed

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.830 
the most difficult that you've competed
in<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.480> your<00:00:27.599> career<00:00:28.880> it<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> don't

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
in in your career it was but I don't

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.659 
in in your career it was but I don't
know<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> four<00:00:31.859> patterns<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.520> were
