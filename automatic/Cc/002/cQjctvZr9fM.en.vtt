Latin<00:00:22.820> it's<00:00:23.820> based<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.180> rough<00:00:24.539> lots<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> fun<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
Latin it's based on rough lots of fun to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.060 
Latin it's based on rough lots of fun to
play<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.570> should<00:00:27.570> add<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> your<00:00:28.230> toolbox<00:00:28.680> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
play I should add it to your toolbox so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.820 
play I should add it to your toolbox so
here's<00:00:29.490> how<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> goes<00:00:29.869> okay<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.679> not

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
here's how it goes okay so this is not

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
here's how it goes okay so this is not
going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> detailed<00:00:32.700> study<00:00:33.480> about<00:00:33.840> how

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
going to be a detailed study about how

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.610 
going to be a detailed study about how
to<00:00:34.110> play<00:00:34.700> roughs<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.320> basically<00:00:37.320> how<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to play roughs but basically how it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
to play roughs but basically how it
works<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> right<00:00:39.719> hand<00:00:39.960> double

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
works is you do a right hand double

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
works is you do a right hand double
stroke<00:00:40.590> followed<00:00:40.980> by<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> left<00:00:41.489> hand<00:00:41.700> accent<00:00:47.120> or

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
stroke followed by a left hand accent or

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.670 
stroke followed by a left hand accent or
the<00:00:48.300> other<00:00:48.450> way<00:00:48.690> around<00:00:48.719> starting<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the other way around starting with the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:02.660 
the other way around starting with the
left<00:00:53.149> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.329> switch<00:00:54.570> between<00:00:54.750> both<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
left you can switch between both so the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
left you can switch between both so the
general<00:01:02.850> idea<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.989> double<00:01:04.650> as

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
general idea is to get the double as

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.800 
general idea is to get the double as
close<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.540> main

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
close as you can to the to the main

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.000 
close as you can to the to the main
accented<00:01:07.500> note<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.990> case<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> my<00:01:10.560> drum

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
accented note so in the case of my drum

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.399 
accented note so in the case of my drum
lick<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:11.610> playing<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> double<00:01:12.930> with

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
lick here I'm playing the double with

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.289 
lick here I'm playing the double with
the<00:01:13.439> first<00:01:13.770> note<00:01:13.979> played<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> hi-hat<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the first note played on the hi-hat and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.399 
the first note played on the hi-hat and
the<00:01:15.540> second<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.170> played<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> snare<00:01:17.130> drum

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.399 

so<00:01:22.409> when<00:01:23.040> i'm<00:01:23.189> what<00:01:23.700> i'm<00:01:24.080> doing<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.350> i'm

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so when i'm what i'm doing here is i'm

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.370 
so when i'm what i'm doing here is i'm
using<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> rebound<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.939> high<00:01:27.270> hat<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
using the rebound of the high hat so the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.609 
using the rebound of the high hat so the
stick<00:01:28.619> bounces<00:01:29.400> back<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> direct

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
stick bounces back and then I I direct

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.280 
stick bounces back and then I I direct
the<00:01:31.680> stick<00:01:32.009> towards<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.759> snare<00:01:33.030> drum<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.079> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the stick towards the snare drum and I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
the stick towards the snare drum and I
basically<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.860> let<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> drop<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:36.000> know

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
basically just let it drop you know

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
basically just let it drop you know
taking<00:01:36.360> advantage<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.200> gravity<00:01:38.130> since<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
taking advantage of gravity since the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:02:01.430 
taking advantage of gravity since the
snare<00:01:39.000> drum<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.329> slower<00:01:39.600> than<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> high<00:01:40.140> hat

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.850 

so<00:02:02.440> that's<00:02:02.830> basically<00:02:03.040> what<00:02:03.520> all<00:02:03.970> I'm<00:02:04.330> doing

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so that's basically what all I'm doing

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.680 
so that's basically what all I'm doing
sometimes<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:05.979> play<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.670> same<00:02:06.940> lick<00:02:07.150> on<00:02:07.390> my

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
sometimes I play the same lick on my

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.680 
sometimes I play the same lick on my
auxiliary<00:02:08.610> snapper<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:10.000> my<00:02:10.149> second<00:02:10.450> bedroom

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
auxiliary snapper on my second bedroom

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.130 
auxiliary snapper on my second bedroom
here<00:02:10.990> in<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:12.220> case<00:02:12.520> I<00:02:12.790> have<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.420> redirect<00:02:13.750> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
here in this case I have to redirect the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.330 
here in this case I have to redirect the
stick<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.370> right<00:02:15.610> stick<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:17.740> what's<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.100> left

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
stick the right stick to what's the left

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
stick the right stick to what's the left
because<00:02:18.940> my<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.480> know<00:02:19.600> snare<00:02:19.900> drum<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.140> so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
because my you know snare drum is so

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:34.229 
because my you know snare drum is so
it's<00:02:20.440> left<00:02:20.709> off<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.010> hyatt<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.850> basically

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
it's left off the hyatt that's basically

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.110 
it's left off the hyatt that's basically
how<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.480> works<00:02:34.780> just<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.100> try<00:02:37.060> it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
how it works just you know I try it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.270 
how it works just you know I try it
slowly<00:02:37.239> first<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.050> get<00:02:38.350> get<00:02:38.650> used<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.100> that

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
slowly first and get get used to that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.000 
slowly first and get get used to that
you<00:02:40.000> know<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.390> rebound<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> redirecting

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
you know the rebound and the redirecting

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.840 
you know the rebound and the redirecting
of<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.700> stick<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:44.620> sure<00:02:45.010> after<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.670> bit<00:02:45.820> of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
of the stick and I'm sure after a bit of

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.640 
of the stick and I'm sure after a bit of
practice<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.720> can<00:02:46.930> play<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.410> at<00:02:47.590> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
practice you you can play that it at a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.210 
practice you you can play that it at a
fairly<00:02:47.920> good<00:02:48.130> speed<00:02:48.400> already<00:02:48.790> give<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.810> try

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:29.080 

you

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:39.880 

I

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.890 

rhythm
