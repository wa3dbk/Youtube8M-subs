00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone I am always lara la 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.020
 your beauty advisor 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.200
 brescia for the province of brescia 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.360
 today I talk to you about the bb trim then 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 now the evb cream is very fashionable 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 a little all the cosmetic houses are 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.939
 launching this type of product by 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.289
 what is it a cream 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 practically a kind of cream 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.480
 colored but it helps to uniform 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 the complexion make it more velvety 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.440
 in short, a kind of personal opinion 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.110
 then enhanced colored cream 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.390
 the brescia launched his bbk rim that is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.300
 I have this in coloring 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 light there are two available light and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.469
 medium to now I have to make a premise 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 in the sense that you will hardly find 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 a live trim with a good in c 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 because you live cream and they are practically 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.390
 based on silicones because to make 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.939
 the so uniform complexion so perfect 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.310
 we still need silicones 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.020
 the kobe fanatics I am 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.240
 keep away 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.970
 having said that this too unfortunately 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.119
 however it contains from silicones I have to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.009
 to admit it, however, has me in any case 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.100
 I speak of the efficacy of the product not 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.950
 I'm going into the eco-bio issue 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.299
 because it is a personal choice in the end 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.030
 then I tried 3 of them again cream 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.460
 of three different brands 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.860
 this is the one I prefer because 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 two others I tried then did not 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.470
 I quote the brand but one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.579
 and very difficult to lay leaves you 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 spots the other is not bad but this me 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.990
 like more because the other is not 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.189
 colored like microspheres than in 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.860
 the moment you spread it, it becomes colored 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.439
 then I do the skin instead 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.170
 see the coloring liked because it is 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.789
 the one that is best with skin tone 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.880
 I don't know if you can see it here on 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:13.260
 my hand then it has a undertone 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.930
 a bit rosy and maybe that's why yes 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.660
 mix well with my skin while there 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.049
 medium is however very clear you have to 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.360
 to know that the living cream lighter but 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.610
 that other medium a more subdued 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.060
 pale yellow you see here that is not fixed 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.190
 pretty much more on my hand than me 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.750
 I find good light or on this moment not 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.690
 I have the foundation I have worn only 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.540
 this bb cream and I like the effect 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.150
 which gives however because it moisturizes the skin and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.180
 at the same time it makes it very uniform 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.760
 if you have no particular problems with 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.750
 leather can be worn instead of 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 foundation though still my opinion 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.620
 it must be worn on special occasions 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.690
 because if you start to put it anyway 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.150
 every day a base that contains 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.859
 many silicones in the long run then the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.890
 skin is ruined but for occasions 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.319
 specials where you still want a 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.319
 almost perfect complexion 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.340
 I think the bb cream is a great one 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.590
 choice so I recommend this 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.200
 if you are interested as usual 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.959
