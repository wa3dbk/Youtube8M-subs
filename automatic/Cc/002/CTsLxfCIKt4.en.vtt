it when I was a kid I still think it's

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.280 
it when I was a kid I still think it's
kind<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.150> cool<00:04:43.330> even<00:04:43.570> though<00:04:43.690> it's<00:04:43.900> not<00:04:44.050> really

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
kind of cool even though it's not really

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.430

another kind of effect the other one but

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.650 
another kind of effect the other one but
I<00:05:12.500> can't<00:05:12.770> really<00:05:12.980> know<00:05:13.910> if<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.150> can<00:05:14.270> see<00:05:14.480> that

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
I can't really know if you can see that

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.200 
I can't really know if you can see that
on<00:05:14.780> camera<00:05:15.080> but<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.800> don't<00:05:16.520> know<00:05:16.610> what<00:05:16.760> function

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
on camera but I don't know what function

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.660 
on camera but I don't know what function
that's<00:05:17.420> served<00:05:20.950> but<00:05:21.950> on<00:05:22.100> these<00:05:22.250> figures<00:05:22.640> the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
that's served but on these figures the

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.310 
that's served but on these figures the
legs<00:05:23.060> could<00:05:23.390> move<00:05:23.600> not<00:05:24.350> very<00:05:24.650> articulated<00:05:25.370> but

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
legs could move not very articulated but

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.830 
legs could move not very articulated but
just<00:05:27.320> at<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.560> hip<00:05:28.060> this<00:05:29.060> one<00:05:29.240> moves<00:05:29.450> all<00:05:29.630> right

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
just at the hip this one moves all right

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.580 
just at the hip this one moves all right
I<00:05:29.870> just<00:05:30.110> don't<00:05:30.260> have<00:05:30.530> two<00:05:31.010> hands-free<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:32.590> hold

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
I just don't have two hands-free to hold

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.180
