00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
because obviously you know your

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.000 
because obviously you know your
strengths<00:00:24.660> diminishes<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.410> after<00:00:25.769> every

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
strengths diminishes but after every

also my max day my max day is once a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.040 
also my max day my max day is once a
month<00:00:35.700> i<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:35.969> what's<00:00:36.300> called<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> max<00:00:36.809> days

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
month i do what's called the max days

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
month i do what's called the max days
when<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.290> calculate<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.100> rep<00:00:38.340> max<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.790> every

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
when i calculate my one rep max on every

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.740 
when i calculate my one rep max on every
single<00:00:39.800> isolation<00:00:40.800> exercise<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:42.239> every<00:00:42.540> body

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
single isolation exercise for every body

single isolation exercise for every body
part<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.379> i<00:00:43.770> calculate<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.550> went<00:00:44.760> back<00:00:44.940> for

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
part so i calculate my one went back for

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.090 
part so i calculate my one went back for
chest<00:00:46.350> back<00:00:47.660> bicep<00:00:48.660> tricep<00:00:48.690> everything<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
chest back bicep tricep everything the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.010 
chest back bicep tricep everything the
reason<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:50.820> i<00:00:51.180> need<00:00:51.690> i<00:00:51.989> need

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
reason for that because i need i need

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
reason for that because i need i need
that<00:00:52.199> data<00:00:52.500> i<00:00:52.770> use<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.489> stuff<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that data i use it for a lot of stuff I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.150 
that data i use it for a lot of stuff I
used<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> figure<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
used to figure out what kind of

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.720 
used to figure out what kind of
what<00:00:57.700> kind<00:00:57.910> of

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
what kind of

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.970 
what kind of
muscle<00:00:59.540> fibers<00:00:59.840> i<00:00:59.930> have<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.320> this<00:01:00.410> area<00:01:00.770> he

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
muscle fibers i have in this area he

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.530 
muscle fibers i have in this area he
