00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.630
 welcome to the erbacher 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.790
 live tv i am the christian and you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.530
 asked us how we do ours more 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.519
 you get water 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.289
 now a video 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.310
 before we touch to the actual 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.220
 we would like to bring you some basics 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.539
 For example, how do I measure 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.550
 at all the salt content in the seawater 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.010
 we do that about a spindle there is 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.689
 other methods are the reasons 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.400
 but cheap and relatively 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.599
 Precisely the other one we already have 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 However, they did not find it tried 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.390
 So good that's why we recommend the donation 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.969
 the optimum salt content is 10 23 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 and is measured at 25 degrees 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 if your other temperature of the water 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.579
 you have to adjust this temperature 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.520
 some spindles such as these 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.870
 installed by gbl thermometer and shows 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
 then the correction value to you 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 if you take the salt water below 20 degrees 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 then you have the problem that that 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 Calcium precipitates something for the corals 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.079
 is needed 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 So you have to try the water 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.180
 if possible at room temperature or 25 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.040
 to hear degrees in our case we have 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.590
 Here is an extra room we at 25 degrees 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 heat up so there is the perfect 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.610
 values ​​reached so we can directly 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 read from the spindle 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.820
 Of course everyone has this situation 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.680
 maybe he would have to if for example 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.110
 the whole thing in the cellar becomes the ingredient 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.630
 hang in and then the whole on 25 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.119
 degree 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.009
 Now we come to the topic how is this going 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.270
 you need water next 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.100
 of course a container was the whole thing 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 we can have a 200 here 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.200
 liter barrel 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 this has the advantage that we still 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.780
 larger quantities in one go 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.829
 can produce if for example with 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.799
 the water quality is not something 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.210
 Of course you need one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.009
 Marker glasses if none available 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.090
 is what makes you in ten or 25 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.740
 meter steps 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.420
 so you can see how much water 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.170
 in there is and the respective amount of salt 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 pour out 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 how to do that show you now the month 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.960
 container selected and now comes the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.240
 pure water 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.070
 we take osmosis water you should 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.479
 sometimes they open up too 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.770
 tap water, however, you have there 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.750
 the problem is that they are regular 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.970
 pollutants in the water 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.830
 and will not be successful in the long term 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.140
 because of that or have already 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.460
 osmosis plant or buy that osmosis 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.530
 water tourer at the dealer 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.820
 so is definitely cheaper if it is 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.930
 You make yourself and you become easy 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.830
 container filled we have 50 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.110
 liters of water 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.060
 that means special rates for us 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.530
 we need 212 km 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 that must weigh now 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.300
 and now comes the water 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.100
 you should not do anything with the installation 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:53.740
 crowd train station rumtreiben I prefer 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:56.100
 new water men what stays easy 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.100
 play 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.670
 Of course we have to be neat 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.010
 dissolve 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.420
 that does not work on its own 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.500
 a little help so you can here 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.510
 stir vigorously 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.100
 or if he does not mind 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.840
 behind a bomb you throw 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.540
 one turns on and everyone is running 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.990
 then it is water stadler water 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.990
 check 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.140
 Once seen at the end of videos 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.940
 we hope you enjoyed it and 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.170
 just rate us again 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.900
 you have us so great too 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.130
 We would like to thank you for that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.120
 and of course we will be new 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.710
 Setting videos 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.000
 otherwise we wish you one 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.770
 Christmas holidays and a good one 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.770
 happy new year and say nice 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.230
 so that's it there must be neat 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.520
 not top teams with
