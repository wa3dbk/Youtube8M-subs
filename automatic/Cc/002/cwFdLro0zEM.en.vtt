00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 in this video we are going to see some mox or 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.410
 alternative constructions for this 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.000
 small set of ironman against ultra is 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 this little box that we see in 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 screen we are also seeing the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 model that is included and that's how 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.980
 It remains when we follow the instructions 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 of the manual that comes in the box are 92 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.160
 pieces that we have including 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.750
 pieces of the mini figures and although 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 appear few are actually 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.099
 enough to play to build things 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.140
 new ones and then of course they are not going to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 be very complex models because we are 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 somewhat limited but the important thing is that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.219
 let's build new things here we have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.320
 model 1 which is a small ship or a 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.450
 hovercraft vehicle and when I say 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.969
 hovercraft I'm thinking of the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.700
 vehicles hovercraft or spiders of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 star wars to this model first I put him 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 antennas then remove them to see 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.129
 how it looked I think the antennas give it 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.930
 look a little further and say police 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.789
 This vehicle is not based on star 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.170
 wars but by not having to before in this 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.280
 set then the first thing that comes to mind 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.280
 would build ships 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.909
 the second model is a station 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.009
 work or a desk with computer 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.869
 for ironman this desk has those 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.000
 curved legs ahead I feel that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.740
 they give it a modern look good according to me 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.299
 the backrest of the chair is this piece 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 curve that helps that the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.530
 Furniture look very modern and in addition 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.090
 we have a milestone robot with antenna that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 would be like a pet for 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 ironman like those little robots 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.490
 that come out in star wars remember them and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 clear all this to build is a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 imagination exercise should not be 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.189
 so literal is to say there are three are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.050
 appears this is a side wall because 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.640
 the ego this is what it is about 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.140
 build what allows us to our 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.179
 imagination the screen of the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.039
 computer is adjustable thanks to 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.330
 we have this this black piece this 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.330
 black skeleton arm 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.299
 the model 3 according to me is a motorcycle 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.340
 Flying patrol I like the pieces 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.350
 lateral those curves those that seem 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.360
 a quarter of a circle because I feel that 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.170
 they give it an effect like wing or like 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.819
 stabilizer 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.950
 although from behind the space looks very 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.390
 closed so it's not as aerodynamic 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.160
 actually but good in some way 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.690
 I had to give firmness to the model because 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.010
 if he was not going to be very weak and he was going to 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.989
 disarm with any small 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.700
 movement on the blue screen that is 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.980
 in front of the pilot we have a connection 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.860
 illegal illegal is told to any 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.600
 connection or unconventional assembly or 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.819
 whether the pieces are not designed 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.680
 to connect with each other in this way 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.660
 as seen here in the blue box with 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.850
 the black arm but good if you can 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.950
 connect if possible I say here what 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.569
 We are seeing this bike I wanted him 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.280
 add the two long pieces be 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.019
 sad and I think they improve a lot 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.000
 design although it does not seem motorcycle now 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.000
 it looks like a ship or a spider 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.870
 the long antennas help or contribute 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.280
 to give a special effect and here the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.930
 I have assembled in such a way that 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.150
 they can turn and if we throw them back 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.150
 the vehicle grabs another effect 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.870
 model 4 is another hovercraft or 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.310
 spider a little bit different but what 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.110
 I like this is the back 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.150
 the back pieces would be like 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.830
 stabilizers if they were higher 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.510
 but good in this case are pointing 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.120
 down and to the sides you have these 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.190
 blasters or pistols throw buttons that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.170
 they give another effect as if they were their 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.540
 propellers or they would simply be your 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.730
 taillights or also weapons that are 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.440
 pointing back to defend 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.480
 front we have some small little points 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.370
 to shoot and it's really about 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.170
 handyman mini figure and clear are the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.170
 hands of one of the sentinels of the troll 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.030
 and as a test I put the antennas to the 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.030
 sides to see what effect it was taking 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.020
 model 5 is the desert pilgrim 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.270
 good so I can call it because 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.250
 is this character as a traveler who goes in 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.380
 an animal that would be like a camel or 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.260
 Troy of a camel or robot an animal 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.360
 robot because 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.729
 although it would also seem like to the pse 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.620
 his big head and his big antlers that in 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.090
 reality are your live weapons for 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.040
 defend yourself in the desert of the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.930
 robbers although he also has a face 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.240
 of thief is a hostile place where 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.760
 everyone steals everyone that's why they're 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.919
 well armed and his head is mobile since 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.560
 can walk in tracking mode in mode 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.570
 of navigation or in defense mode this 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.400
 little black arm is his neck and right now 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.560
 they are new pieces because it supports the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.389
 weight of the big head because if there are many 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.130
 pieces for a good head for this 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.780
 neck and when you encounter a 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.150
 thief has weapons in front for 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.670
 fend 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.800
 model 6 is another office although I 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.540
 I would prefer to tell you that it is a panel of 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.670
 control or like the control panel 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.870
 of some machinery or of a whole 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.670
 installation has antenna 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.040
 communications and many buttons 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.740
 control many accessories and the little arm 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.540
 black could do as a lever or a 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.569
 microphone the chair is a model 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.909
 different from the previous 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.969
 and the blaster throws buttons in this case 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.889
 they serve as a coat rack 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.389
 and these were good models 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.759
 they happened to me yesterday afternoon playing 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:22.589
 with this little lego box , we'll see you 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.589
 the next video bye bye
