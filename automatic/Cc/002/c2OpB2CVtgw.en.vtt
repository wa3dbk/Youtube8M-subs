00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.559
 hello you love and live again today 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.049
 from nature 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.040
 I want you a lot again today 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 Delicious hardly imagine what would 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.110
 maybe many now 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.420
 Surprises for one of my favorites 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.160
 Herbs are yours but you have to be now 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 looking for a quieter place because of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.700
 wind today very very far and then has 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.460
 you at least wind up after the wind 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.880
 here so idyllic next to one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.440
 maisfeld 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 it is the one who comes to life 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.489
 to the white geese turkey the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.620
 more advanced food is a plant which 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.149
 in principle wherever you rest them 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.160
 So I have her for now 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.360
 For example , I 'll show you right away 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 found the video where yes if you build 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 where you fed the whole and where 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.360
 you actually do not do anything with it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.640
 there will eventually be fallow land 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.799
 places where you can only really and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.010
 which is also funny that suits him 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.680
 she can grow 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.350
 but most also CONCIERGE country at 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.670
 corn field edges so you have to say if 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.190
 you pay attention and you do it like that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.940
 a bit through the area and pay attention 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 one to an estimated problem-soon you will 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.290
 then find I've just maintained but 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.170
 The joy is very warm and then moves in 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.430
 bit hanging Tauss looks head of rum 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.930
 if I keep here 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.090
 sad and let his head hang 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.800
 I think you can see well so 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.710
 Normally, the whole is your call 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.750
 but not quite so early 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.010
 shieldable it hangs a bit that is 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.229
 yes go on walking but I have 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.150
 also made a lot of photos moby and 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.060
 again and again better 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.650
 then you can imagine yourself 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.750
 better imagine 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.500
 this has the computer is just ahead 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.120
 the more so at this plant so 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.890
 I think so the taste of the taste 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 is really very nice of 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.280
 sweetish too and somehow suitable 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.170
 great for salads or wester man's 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.570
 squeeze or just in the free the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.660
 now unlike the lion 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.459
 For example, at the service only then 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.650
 makes bitter or the juice when you solve 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.200
 drive very bitter that the presta 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.450
 are whole and taste I mean I 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.480
 here in quite sweetish taste, however 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.980
 a weeping willow a bit just that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.709
 was the advantage and then it is like that 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.810
 the plant actually not so 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.830
 really 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.930
 so you will not find anywhere now 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.330
 somehow so that you could have money 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.280
 but many good features go away 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.200
 everything works very strongly inflammations 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.209
 chains anti-inflammatory and it for that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.830
 open wounds very good and straight at 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.989
 somehow on this post or has 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.400
 so then do both internally 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.160
 also applied for very good but man 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.850
 can let the leaves dry and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.410
 can then easily make on good and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.959
 drink what I do the most 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.940
 i am using the complete plant 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.100
 cuts the whole plant in 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.739
 small pieces and then would have to in the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.900
 salad or when I relieve it 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.870
 So also everything from stems 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.860
 bloom or warm you have to say yes and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.140
 the leaves 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.210
 everything is used you can do everything 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.890
 eating safely also tastes very good 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.370
 Now there is now I have to look 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.050
 There are two things you might think about 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.160
 You should pay attention to this once 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.640
 he was still fresh right-leaning 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.730
 still has really green strong styles 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.550
 and not so pronounced seed 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.170
 stood here you can see now 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.630
 It really made a big difference here 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.550
 ball seeds and small leaves in the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.360
 relationship to it and finally dry 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.160
 in the game 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.410
 I hope that I was familiar with computer 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.080
 I have no control screen here 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.290
 and the only one who says so when it's up 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.300
 then quite tough and against this one 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.200
 pretty much what you are like so if I am 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.630
 watch it even if I things 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.000
 Break it is really juicy important 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.510
 that I also know that live 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.430
 still in there 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.959
 and, of course , life also beats here 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.610
 but he has so much drier in it 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.500
 I want to say so it will be one 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.940
 plant finds it so dry 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.989
 then I would not be the bull now 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.700
 necessarily with food then he tastes 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.080
 not so good if you have a plant 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.760
 she still finds it right in the juice 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.250
 and then I can be really good 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.890
 They really recommend too much to you 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.210
 Eating can also be easily missed 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.620
 I really had to pull hard 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.419
 that I understand most already 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.490
 bit picky 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.169
 and if I plant myself 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.790
 is still green like it is 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.169
 really green and thick constantly looks 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.090
 and does not have so many seed stalls yet 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.560
 and they really just break off 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.820
 need those are the most delicious so the 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.340
 Can I then because still missing 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.710
 Most of what is out there exactly 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.450
 okay that was the day I believe the sun 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.890
 dazzles me I'm driving sweat now 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.030
 really was today but nice is yes if 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.830
 I do not complain, I hope so 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.510
 could inspire again and you like 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.130
