00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.780

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.169
 my baby has basically been a birth 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.029
 complicated I think I'll talk about the process 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.939
 of how to write a book and publish it 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.000
 in some other video but today I'm very 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.579
 very very happy that this is 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.040
 project there finally come to light is 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.399
 I can not believe this book is 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:45.559
 the fruit of my experience of the 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.890
 last 4 or 5 years and comes to use in 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.050
 what I have wanted is to use 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.850
 personal experiences is worth counting 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.230
 like me 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.059
 overcome one of the worst moments 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.489
 business of my life that was close 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.519
 a previous business and close with a 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.979
 important debt of about 30 thousand 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.580
 euros or so and he like ski lift according 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.229
 of how from a moment where I my 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.060
 self-esteem was in tatters so 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.600
 say it where do you pose many things 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.420
 it is a very important turning point 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.700
 and how do you reorient ski lift and dessert 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.820
 the truth of my life now is to 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.200
 light years of what it was then and if 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.320
 someone would have told me then the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.700
 time your life will be like this in 2015 I do not 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.380
 I would have believed it or it would be impossible 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.680
 it's called who I am to do this 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.210
 because it's the name of my border and 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.860
 border that is already the critic 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.600
 internal that we all have inside and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.789
 against which we are all fighting each 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.430
 day I included everyone has it 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.320
 What is it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.730
 good thing is that each person has a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.420
 different border but mine 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.210
 you basically feel you've thought it's 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.380
 so I called it that too as a result of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 a conversation with a friend who 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.410
 he said hey persie your borderline is who 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.360
 it's me to do this because no no 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.500
 stop telling you not who you are to 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.720
 write a book who are you to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.430
 launch this you want to create this 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 makes this vision a reality that you 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.709
 you have and others and I know that many 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.020
 people also have this border 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.060
 to say good but who am I and others 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.720
 to get everything I want to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.430
 use dreaming in all the things that I want 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.710
 the book what it does is it gives you some 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.390
 guidelines for 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.520

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 you really want to identify also 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.600
 the way your frontier has and the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.210
 mutations that this borderline takes 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.250
 from the fear that is good in the 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.620
 universal mutation until the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.620
 perfectionism blame criticism there 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.150
