00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.410
 why then not expect competition from cancer is a 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.499
 compilation of mini-games this time 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.559
 aaer it makes me rather happy to be honest we find ourselves rather 

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:24.429
 in front of a platform game 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.849
 old 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.519
 well then it even appears to those who are fans of the panam so up 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.789
 the end they are once again the only one this time 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.660
 % and platform games today are pretty rare and it's 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.649
 no more bad goals or in conflicts of mini-games as it is done 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.390
 a lot right now to have a real platform game with pretty levels 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.980
 well built 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 to find sensations% dira cci head 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.850
 it is at the same time the gameplay is not possible to the uer than that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.200
 a mario of insanities 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.420
 at this age still relatively easy it's the idiot rabbits have 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.120
 does of course think it could affect any kind of audience 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.819
 so crs and% is simple how are not very complicated one can 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:03.000
 run after 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.130
 getting hurt caught from three objects but the player is still pretty the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.760
 guide in five years the moves whenever you want when you want to jump for 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.640
 hang creepers 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.980
 the perla cling alone that I would have a steep area on foot 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:15.719
 down 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.460
 alas this opinion does it alone 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.770
 so this fair comtoise adecco orders very evolved but this is the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.030
 kind of target audience who wants that but it's website things 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.680
 we have already seen as not a lot of platform games formerly 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.509
 there is no real originality in the same club 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.980
 so that's the little complaint I'll make them 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.290
 hamon afterwards in terms of content we still have about sixty 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.440
 levels 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.100
 good it's not very hard but there is still something to play as well 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.500
 spread over 4 years and over four great times not through the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.920
 ages so in prehistoric times of average thursday j 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.940
 the teachers 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.710
 a gift that is still a little bit of variety in the sets 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.150
 on the other hand in the levels me even if the levels are many I 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.600
 would still blame the game of b 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 to have some redundancy in fact the man 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.840
 there are a lot of levels but often the same thing is not so much 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.940
 of different enemies maneuvering mano 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.519
 according to the site mediapart 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.579
 can not achieve a lot of action 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.739
 the progression curve the gameplay 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.159
 she did not necessarily do a lot of things over the adventure and that 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.949
 it's still something that few things 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.119
 now percent 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.139
 to counterbalance all that we still have the normans have it bonus 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:29.269
 to get back 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.419
 it can unlock images this dvd can unlock costumes 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.409
 3d figurines that can be seen in galleries 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.120
 but all that is things that will inflate a little bit the life of the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.490
 Thu 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.079
 and who will allow it to exploit 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.019
 the whole extent of the levels because level his access to the wreckage to 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.469
 branching the levels it's not totally ruined in account either 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.109
 do not just go straight to the end of the level, you still have to 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.869
 exploit a little so we can find all these menus that 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.569
 that nowadays a little more depth despite everything 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.429
 amano to finish there the technical part m 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.309
 because that's what we expect from a 3ds game 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:05.119
 Beaujolais place case not much to say it's not especially pretty 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:07.929
 seven men are over if properly realized 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:13.559
 and the 3d brings the same type depth in our visual beds 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.559
 poultry and scenery port that's why in school it has quite a lot 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.980
 more prostitutes in the figure of power 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.980
 so that's a nice little relief effect but it's still 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.279
 anecdotal in workshop 2 of three moments which I hate 3d effects 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.069
 like that 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.779
 but it's not the 3d that makes the gameplay it's something 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:34.779
 cosmetics that is there to justify fraud on the possible 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:38.489
 so now what to remember in the end I think it's a game 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.230
 that has the merit of being original because on 3ds as the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.409
 copy-paste mind-blowing enough for stefan release week so that's it 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.409
 nice old-fashioned platform that shows it too 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:53.979
 and percent and here are the issers the players who are too fed to 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.709
 baby bottle and marion-dufresne nike from their platform score 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.979
 to be able to be even when one is a little bit hungry it would be a 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.189
 Buyer 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.569
 Thursday the pam launched a game that is not very difficult 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.009
 but there is also some time and festivities in the levels in the 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.039
 constructive actions with expectations 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.699
 now we will pass to the players to know if from there rather privilege the 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.409
 having a game 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.729
 quite funny with a side shifted and the second degree 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.650
 for example really pushed as can the platform game to get it 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.650
