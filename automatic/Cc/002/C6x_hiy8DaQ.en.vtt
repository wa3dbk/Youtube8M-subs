but you can't honor and say maybe that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.660 
but you can't honor and say maybe that
was<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> consistent<00:02:34.350> decision<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:36.120> know

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
was not a consistent decision you know

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.050 
was not a consistent decision you know
that's<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.910> right<00:02:39.120> no<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.420> me<00:02:39.510> see<00:02:41.060> you

right<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.810> did<00:02:43.350> good<00:02:43.470> i<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.650> same<00:02:43.920> as<00:02:44.010> me

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.910 

Mowgli<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.280> not<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.519> like<00:02:51.060> either<00:02:51.209> I

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
Mowgli but not know like either I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.050 
Mowgli but not know like either I
thought<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.040> was<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.190> dog<00:02:53.340> fight<00:02:53.519> for<00:02:53.700> stuff<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
thought it was a dog fight for stuff I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.690 
thought it was a dog fight for stuff I
feel<00:02:54.390> through<00:02:54.690> very<00:02:54.930> good<00:02:55.110> size<00:02:55.350> yeah<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:56.610> we

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
feel through very good size yeah but we

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610 
feel through very good size yeah but we
were<00:02:56.970> not<00:02:57.030> two<00:02:57.209> good<00:02:57.330> chances<00:02:57.480> as<00:02:57.750> well<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.590> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
were not two good chances as well so I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.170 
were not two good chances as well so I
think<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> first<00:02:59.100> 45<00:02:59.459> when<00:02:59.700> she<00:02:59.820> was<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.000> dog

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
think the first 45 when she was a dog

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.330 
think the first 45 when she was a dog
fight<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.870> knew<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.080> was<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.230> dog<00:03:01.440> fight<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:02.010> was

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
fight we knew it was a dog fight it was

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
fight we knew it was a dog fight it was
always<00:03:02.459> going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.850> dogfight<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:04.140> I'm

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
always going to be a dogfight but I'm

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.720 
always going to be a dogfight but I'm
sure<00:03:04.410> they<00:03:04.440> get<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.800> second<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.310> was<00:03:05.400> only<00:03:05.550> one

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
sure they get a second that was only one

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.440 
sure they get a second that was only one
