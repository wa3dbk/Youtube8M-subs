00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
piece of firmware which gets installed

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.990 
piece of firmware which gets installed
on<00:00:32.940> each<00:00:33.540> SD<00:00:33.930> card<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> use<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.000> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
see what's in focus with a kind of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.350 
see what's in focus with a kind of
traditional<00:01:12.750> video<00:01:13.020> camera<00:01:13.439> style<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
traditional video camera style and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.640 
traditional video camera style and
because<00:01:15.360> yeah<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.990> even<00:01:16.290> where<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
because yeah it's even where the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.679 
because yeah it's even where the
viewfinder<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.220> quite<00:01:17.430> hard<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.759> once<00:01:18.540> in

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
viewfinder is quite hard to see once in

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
viewfinder is quite hard to see once in
focus<00:01:19.020> often<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> small<00:01:20.070> screens<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
focus often on the small screens the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700 
focus often on the small screens the
other<00:01:21.030> feature<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.330> use<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> metadata<00:01:22.290> kind

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
other feature I use is the metadata kind

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.280 
other feature I use is the metadata kind
of<00:01:22.799> feature<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.939> basically<00:01:24.630> saves<00:01:25.049> an

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
of feature which basically saves an

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
of feature which basically saves an
extra<00:01:25.560> text<00:01:25.860> file<00:01:26.450> with<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.630> camera

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
extra text file with your camera

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.190 
extra text file with your camera
settings<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:29.220> each<00:01:29.630> file<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.900> record

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
settings with each file that you record

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.450 
settings with each file that you record
so<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:32.400> next<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.880> mvi<00:01:34.040> 2043<00:01:35.040> or

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so right next to your mvi 2043 or

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999 
so right next to your mvi 2043 or
whatever<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> file<00:01:37.320> named<00:01:37.619> MV<00:01:37.979> i

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
whatever it be will be a file named MV i

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.149 
whatever it be will be a file named MV i
2043<00:01:38.939> there'll<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> text<00:01:40.079> file<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.100> will

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
2043 there'll be a text file and it will

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.030 
2043 there'll be a text file and it will
just<00:01:41.340> say<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:43.079> aperture<00:01:43.530> you're<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.829> what

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
just say what aperture you're at what

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.740 
just say what aperture you're at what
shutter<00:01:44.280> speed<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.670> all<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> kind<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
shutter speed and all the kind of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.950 
shutter speed and all the kind of
details<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.710> even<00:01:47.009> updates<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.600> if

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
details I think even updates as you if

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.510 
details I think even updates as you if
you're<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.799> change<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.070> settings<00:01:50.340> during

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you're if you change the settings during

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.800 
you're if you change the settings during
the<00:01:50.670> film<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.329> will<00:01:51.390> note<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the film and I think it will note that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.800 
the film and I think it will note that
down<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.170> well<00:01:52.320> which<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.890> pretty<00:01:53.130> cool<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
down as well which is pretty cool and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
down as well which is pretty cool and
these<00:01:54.810> files<00:01:55.049> don't<00:01:55.320> take<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.590> any<00:01:55.649> space<00:01:55.939> but

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
these files don't take up any space but

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.760 
these files don't take up any space but
they<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.149> allow<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.630> kind<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> see

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
they just allow you to kind of see

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
they just allow you to kind of see
exactly<00:01:58.799> what<00:01:59.579> what<00:02:00.090> how<00:02:00.299> you're<00:02:00.479> shooting

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
exactly what what how you're shooting

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.440 
exactly what what how you're shooting
for<00:02:01.829> each<00:02:01.950> shot<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> final<00:02:03.299> feature

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
for each shot and the final feature

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
for each shot and the final feature
which<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.990> sometimes<00:02:04.229> use<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.280> crop<00:02:05.549> marks

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
which I sometimes use is the crop marks

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.210 
which I sometimes use is the crop marks
now<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> pretty<00:02:07.469> cool<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.009> basically

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
now this is pretty cool it basically

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.920 
now this is pretty cool it basically
allows<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.090> PNG<00:02:09.830> overlay<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
allows you to use a PNG overlay to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.890 
allows you to use a PNG overlay to
simulate<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
simulate the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.710 
simulate the
crop<00:02:14.709> marks<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.159> you<00:02:15.250> put<00:02:15.430> over<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.849> video

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
crop marks that you put over the video

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.660 
crop marks that you put over the video
if<00:02:16.959> you're<00:02:17.200> gonna<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:17.409> doing<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.709> post<00:02:18.010> so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
if you're gonna be doing that post so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.500 
if you're gonna be doing that post so
for<00:02:18.849> instance<00:02:19.209> for<00:02:19.540> episodes<00:02:20.470> like<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:21.510> kind

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
for instance for episodes like this kind

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.289 
for instance for episodes like this kind
of<00:02:22.569> most<00:02:23.110> projects<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.650> don't<00:02:23.830> use<00:02:24.299> the

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
of most projects I don't use the

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.410 
of most projects I don't use the
widescreen<00:02:25.629> bars<00:02:25.989> but<00:02:26.650> my<00:02:27.069> short<00:02:27.280> film<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.790> will

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
widescreen bars but my short film I will

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.890 
widescreen bars but my short film I will
be<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.920> great<00:02:30.099> to<00:02:30.129> be<00:02:30.250> able<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:31.750> what

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
be so it's great to be able to see what

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.880 
be so it's great to be able to see what
its<00:02:32.019> gonna<00:02:32.079> look<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.319> at<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.560> end<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.829> get

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
its gonna look like at the end and get

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.740 
its gonna look like at the end and get
your<00:02:33.040> framing<00:02:33.220> right<00:02:33.459> now<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.329> other<00:02:34.510> thing

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
your framing right now the other thing

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.509 
your framing right now the other thing
that<00:02:34.959> magic<00:02:35.530> lantern<00:02:35.920> allows<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.159> to<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.400> is

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
that magic lantern allows you to do is

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.100 
that magic lantern allows you to do is
to<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.700> more<00:02:36.940> control<00:02:37.180> over<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.750> settings

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
to have more control over the settings

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
to have more control over the settings
of<00:02:38.230> your<00:02:38.260> camera<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.250> for<00:02:39.640> me<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.849> biggest<00:02:40.030> one

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
of your camera so for me the biggest one

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.180 
of your camera so for me the biggest one
is<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:41.519> expanded<00:02:42.519> ISOs<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.079> normally<00:02:44.799> on<00:02:45.040> my

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
is the expanded ISOs so normally on my

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.210 
is the expanded ISOs so normally on my
camera<00:02:45.579> whether<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.510> being<00:02:46.660> 600<00:02:47.200> d<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.470> has<00:02:47.500> is

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
camera whether it being 600 d it has is

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.069 
camera whether it being 600 d it has is
a<00:02:48.370> 100<00:02:48.790> 200<00:02:49.120> 400<00:02:49.329> 800<00:02:49.690> 1600<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.190> plus<00:02:52.079> whereas

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
a 100 200 400 800 1600 and plus whereas

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.869 
a 100 200 400 800 1600 and plus whereas
with<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.470> allows<00:02:53.590> me<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.799> shoot<00:02:54.040> at<00:02:54.220> 160

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
with this it allows me to shoot at 160

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.759 
with this it allows me to shoot at 160
through<00:02:55.769> 2640<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:58.000> 1250<00:02:58.780> which<00:02:59.349> basically

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
through 2640 and 1250 which basically

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.339 
through 2640 and 1250 which basically
are<00:03:00.159> the<00:03:00.519> native<00:03:00.879> ISOs<00:03:01.299> so<00:03:01.930> they're<00:03:02.079> supposed

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
are the native ISOs so they're supposed

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.250 
are the native ISOs so they're supposed
to<00:03:02.409> be<00:03:02.530> cleaner<00:03:02.859> they<00:03:03.760> produce<00:03:04.480> better<00:03:04.780> images

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
to be cleaner they produce better images

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.690 
to be cleaner they produce better images
then<00:03:05.590> some<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.190> ones<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.459> actually

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
then some of the ones that actually

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.930 
then some of the ones that actually
lower<00:03:07.090> them<00:03:07.299> than<00:03:08.019> them<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.609> 640<00:03:09.609> may<00:03:09.790> actually

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
lower them than them so 640 may actually

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.330 
lower them than them so 640 may actually
look<00:03:10.329> better<00:03:10.599> than<00:03:10.900> 400<00:03:11.409> but<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.099> kind<00:03:12.280> of

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
look better than 400 but it kind of

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.030 
look better than 400 but it kind of
varies<00:03:12.519> from<00:03:12.760> each<00:03:12.879> camera<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.450> it's<00:03:13.599> worth

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
varies from each camera so it's worth

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.339 
varies from each camera so it's worth
testing<00:03:15.040> them<00:03:15.280> off<00:03:15.459> yourself<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.970> seeing<00:03:16.349> how

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
testing them off yourself and seeing how

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.650 
testing them off yourself and seeing how
it<00:03:17.470> performs<00:03:17.859> many<00:03:18.730> other<00:03:18.940> cool<00:03:19.090> features<00:03:19.450> is

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
it performs many other cool features is

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.809 
it performs many other cool features is
that<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:20.380> allows<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.769> shoot<00:03:20.889> 140th<00:03:21.609> of<00:03:21.760> a

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
that it allows you to shoot 140th of a

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.879 
that it allows you to shoot 140th of a
second<00:03:22.120> which<00:03:22.359> is<00:03:22.389> closer<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.230> 180<00:03:23.799> degree

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
second which is closer to the 180 degree

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.370 
second which is closer to the 180 degree
rule<00:03:24.220> than<00:03:24.549> 150<00:03:25.030> per<00:03:25.180> second<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:26.349> don't

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
rule than 150 per second and I don't

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.379 
rule than 150 per second and I don't
know<00:03:26.590> if<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:27.310> really<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.760> noticeable<00:03:28.269> I

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
know if this is really that noticeable I

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.640 
know if this is really that noticeable I
suppose<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.840> little<00:03:29.019> bit<00:03:29.139> brighter<00:03:29.319> but

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
suppose it's a little bit brighter but

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.129 
suppose it's a little bit brighter but
in<00:03:30.370> terms<00:03:30.579> of<00:03:30.730> actual<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.540> motion<00:03:31.870> blur<00:03:32.019> and

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
in terms of actual the motion blur and

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.479 
in terms of actual the motion blur and
stuff<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.799> probably<00:03:32.889> won't<00:03:33.190> notice<00:03:33.310> the

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
stuff you probably won't notice the

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.970 
stuff you probably won't notice the
difference<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.870> suppose<00:03:35.169> it's<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.799> little

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
difference but I suppose it's a little

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.089 
difference but I suppose it's a little
bit<00:03:36.069> better<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:38.290> other<00:03:38.440> cool<00:03:38.650> thing<00:03:38.889> is

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
bit better and the other cool thing is

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.250 
bit better and the other cool thing is
the<00:03:40.090> white<00:03:40.239> balance<00:03:40.419> you<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:40.780> more<00:03:41.049> control

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
the white balance you have more control

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.900 
the white balance you have more control
of<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.530> white<00:03:41.650> balance<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.489> rather<00:03:42.639> than<00:03:42.849> just

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
of the white balance so rather than just

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.670 
of the white balance so rather than just
having<00:03:43.120> an<00:03:43.599> option<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:44.169> manual<00:03:44.560> white

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
having an option for manual white

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.009 
having an option for manual white
balance<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:45.250> then<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.669> presets<00:03:46.090> as<00:03:46.690> well<00:03:46.900> as

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
balance and then the presets as well as

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.890 
balance and then the presets as well as
auto<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:48.430> now<00:03:48.579> get<00:03:48.849> all<00:03:49.030> those<00:03:49.150> features<00:03:49.389> plus

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
auto you now get all those features plus

it's quite hard to correct for a shot

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.379 
it's quite hard to correct for a shot
that's<00:04:24.010> far<00:04:24.370> too<00:04:24.400> warm<00:04:24.789> for<00:04:25.000> exact

that's basically a summary of the
features<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.300> use<00:04:31.509> there<00:04:31.810> are<00:04:31.930> there's<00:04:32.409> a

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
features that I use there are there's a

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.640 
features that I use there are there's a
big<00:04:32.830> long<00:04:33.069> list<00:04:33.219> of<00:04:33.460> more<00:04:33.580> features<00:04:34.439> but<00:04:35.439> for

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
big long list of more features but for

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.140 
big long list of more features but for
me<00:04:35.770> those<00:04:35.949> are<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.159> ones<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.759> find<00:04:37.029> myself

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
me those are the ones that I find myself

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.920 
me those are the ones that I find myself
using<00:04:37.360> most<00:04:38.099> so<00:04:39.099> I<00:04:39.479> would<00:04:40.479> encourage<00:04:40.689> you<00:04:40.900> to

using most so I would encourage you to

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.510 
using most so I would encourage you to
check<00:04:41.020> out<00:04:41.319> magic<00:04:41.860> lantern<00:04:42.129> if<00:04:42.219> you<00:04:42.279> haven't

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
check out magic lantern if you haven't

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.269 
check out magic lantern if you haven't
already<00:04:43.259> but<00:04:44.259> do<00:04:44.499> bear<00:04:44.650> in<00:04:44.710> mind<00:04:44.919> that<00:04:45.069> there

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279 
already but do bear in mind that there

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:49.649 
already but do bear in mind that there
is<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.460> risk<00:04:45.749> it's<00:04:46.749> not<00:04:47.020> fully<00:04:47.939> backed<00:04:48.939> by<00:04:49.240> canon

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
is a risk it's not fully backed by canon

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.320 
is a risk it's not fully backed by canon
its<00:04:50.560> third<00:04:50.800> party<00:04:51.249> so<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.759> know<00:04:52.029> look<00:04:52.210> into

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
its third party so you know look into

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.390 
its third party so you know look into
yourself<00:04:52.749> and<00:04:53.349> decide<00:04:53.620> whether<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:54.009> want<00:04:54.189> to

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
yourself and decide whether you want to

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.269 
yourself and decide whether you want to
risk<00:04:55.180> putting<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.599> camera<00:04:55.900> on<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.189> obviously<00:04:57.189> I

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:57.279 
risk putting a camera on it obviously I

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.550 
risk putting a camera on it obviously I
had<00:04:57.610> any<00:04:57.699> problems<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.719> it's<00:04:59.259> known<00:04:59.409> to<00:04:59.529> be

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
had any problems and it's known to be

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.110 
had any problems and it's known to be
pretty<00:04:59.889> stable<00:05:00.069> it's<00:05:00.370> been<00:05:00.520> around<00:05:00.819> for<00:05:01.060> a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
pretty stable it's been around for a

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.570 
pretty stable it's been around for a
while<00:05:01.210> now<00:05:01.449> and<00:05:02.009> the<00:05:03.009> other<00:05:03.099> cool<00:05:03.310> thing<00:05:03.460> is

magic lantern oh really they're really
innovating<00:05:06.099> with<00:05:06.310> their<00:05:07.020> raw<00:05:08.020> video<00:05:08.379> work

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
innovating with their raw video work

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.350 
innovating with their raw video work
they've<00:05:09.099> they've<00:05:09.520> been<00:05:09.639> doing<00:05:09.759> with<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:10.000> 5d

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
they've they've been doing with the 5d

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.100 
they've they've been doing with the 5d
and<00:05:11.759> they're<00:05:12.759> getting<00:05:12.939> some<00:05:13.120> amazing<00:05:13.360> images

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
and they're getting some amazing images

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.519 
and they're getting some amazing images
from<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.590> sensor<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.569> while<00:05:16.569> the<00:05:16.779> 600d<00:05:17.349> may

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
from the sensor and while the 600d may

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.510 
from the sensor and while the 600d may
not<00:05:17.680> have<00:05:17.889> fast<00:05:18.729> enough<00:05:19.800> processor<00:05:20.800> or<00:05:21.039> all

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
not have fast enough processor or all

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.980 
not have fast enough processor or all
the<00:05:21.819> cards<00:05:22.180> aren't<00:05:22.569> good<00:05:22.750> enough<00:05:22.779> or

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
the cards aren't good enough or

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.809 
the cards aren't good enough or
something<00:05:23.169> like<00:05:23.259> that<00:05:23.430> it's<00:05:24.430> definitely

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
something like that it's definitely

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.749 
something like that it's definitely
something<00:05:24.999> to<00:05:25.150> kind<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.080> keep<00:05:26.139> tabs<00:05:26.469> on

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
something to kind of keep tabs on

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.040 
something to kind of keep tabs on
looking<00:05:27.759> out<00:05:27.819> for<00:05:27.939> which<00:05:28.060> cameras<00:05:28.509> can<00:05:28.719> do<00:05:28.900> the

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
looking out for which cameras can do the

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.839 
looking out for which cameras can do the
raw<00:05:29.229> video<00:05:29.409> because<00:05:30.250> when<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.580> becomes

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
raw video because when that becomes

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.879 
raw video because when that becomes
stable<00:05:31.360> that's<00:05:32.289> going<00:05:32.439> to<00:05:32.500> be<00:05:32.589> a<00:05:32.620> really

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
stable that's going to be a really

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.689 
stable that's going to be a really
amazing<00:05:33.430> feature<00:05:33.849> the<00:05:34.839> 5d<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.680> comparable<00:05:36.580> to

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
amazing feature the 5d is comparable to

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.409 
amazing feature the 5d is comparable to
an<00:05:37.180> epic<00:05:37.509> scale<00:05:37.719> down<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.199> 1080p<00:05:38.729> it<00:05:39.729> really<00:05:40.330> is

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
an epic scale down to 1080p it really is

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.809 
an epic scale down to 1080p it really is
quite<00:05:40.599> a<00:05:40.899> great<00:05:41.169> feature<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:42.550> yeah<00:05:42.669> I

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819
