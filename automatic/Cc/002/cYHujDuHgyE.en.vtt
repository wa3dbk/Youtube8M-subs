00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello the bets how are you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.610
 I hope very very well then 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.800
 today I offer you a video of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.580
 DIY I will show you how 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.139
 I relooked but bedside table he 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 we will need white paint from 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.359
 the coating and we lay the paper of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 glass and a little patience 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.859
 if like me your bedside table at 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.650
 drawers it will remove and remove 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 wrists we can now move 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.050
 to sanding and that in two ways to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.040
 using an electric sander as 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.540
 me or using sandpaper 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 in this case I advise you is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 donned the gloves to preserve your 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.960
 hands once our noble thought we are going 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.039
 clean it by passing a rag 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.800
 wet and we renew the operation 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.329
 as many times as necessary until 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.660
 that our furniture is totally 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.399
 clean at one time our furniture dry 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.260
 we can move to the next step is 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.740
 this one is to reach our 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.610
 bedside with a first under layer 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.229
 of coating reserved for this purpose 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.270
 thinking makes it possible to render 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.979
 furniture its raw look and this allows 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.950
 also to the painting of diane 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.290
 hung without this operation the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.799
 paint would slide on the furniture and the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.170
 render will not be so sharp and 7 under 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.340
 layer also helps prevent the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.469
 paint does not flake over time 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.719
 I use a roll for the areas the 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.229
 more important and a brush for them 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.229
 smaller 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.650
 and above all we do not forget to ask 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.370
 masking tape around all 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.370
 hate to protect 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.420
 after finishing with our sub 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.200
 layer it will have to wait pretty much 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:15.569
 between 6 and 8 hours to get a good 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.730
 drying in order to remove small 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.820
 imperfections one thinks again with some 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.890
 sandpaper with very fine grain and 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.570
 as in the previous step in and you 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.100
 with a damp cloth and let 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.130
 to dry 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.450
 we can now start painting 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.430
 I chose a satin paint 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.650
 but you can choose according to your 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.470
 taste a glossy or matte paints 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.330
 for example and to pass the painting 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.220
 is following your motivation 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.050
 brush roll 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.910
 when our 9 essec we can fix 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.670
 wrists and everything that could be 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.060
 withdrawn as for example the feet if 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.060
 there were 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.710
 a little humidified the ribbon of 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.150
 masking to remove it more easily 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.100
 and here is our furniture that had taken a 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.410
 little old man and we were 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.440
 tired left a rocky name 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.580
 virulently 9 there remains only the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.580
 wear these supplements 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.990
 you saw it's very easy 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.790
 moreover I used products that 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.800
 it can be found without problem in 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.290
 any DIY store to 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.610
 very affordable prices 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.770
 I hope this video will be of 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.940
 certain utility or at least you 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.210
 will give ideas to you very soon and big 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.210
 kisses
