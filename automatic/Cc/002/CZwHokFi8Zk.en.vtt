00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
 Yesterday I received a message from one of the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.080
 subscribers here from my youtube channel 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.030
 Wondering what kind of lighting 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.620
 that I use to record my videos and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.240
 Like every week I record a video. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 especially for you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 answering your questions today, I 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.420
 I decided to answer the question of our 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.420
 Friend Roberto who lives in Australia 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.279
 so let's go there the lighting format 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.269
 that the use is what we call three 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.090
 points 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.270
 three-point lighting the name already says 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.430
 are three lights that I use to illuminate the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.450
 on the left and one on top of the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.250
 my head 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 the light that is on my right is what 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 we call primary light ie is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.070
 the strongest light is not of all the 3 light 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.870
 that is on my left is the light of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 fill what we call light 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 because if you use only the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.350
 light on your right will create a lot of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.809
 shadow on your left side of the face 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.229
 so I use this fill light 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 It's breaking this shadow a little 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.210
 also creating a contrast is legal for 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.130
 not stay on both sides with the same 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.439
 lighting side lighter one side more 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 darker and the third light that we 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.770
 we use as I mentioned before is the light 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.110
 Of Head 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.689
 many call it against light or those of 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.540
 hair I can not call hair 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.310
 because I do not have hair 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.759
 we end up getting used to it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.619
 then I call the head probably 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.040
 You must be asking what the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.229
 against this light with this light. 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.590
 simply causes a separation between 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.549
 You, in this case, I and my background. 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.369
 infinite 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.640
 suppose I would have hair hair 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.250
 dark black I had black hair 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.210
 dark if I did not use one against light 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 that happening my hair would stay is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.250
 same color of my background is from my background 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.329
 black and would have no contrast then 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.240
 the person and end up appearing like me 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.369
 so goes to the head then this against 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.539
 simply to separate you from the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.310
 your infinite background 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.510
 Now I'll show you how it would look 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.330
 this lighting in the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.790
 practice connecting one light after another 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.989
 for you to get the difference between 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.909
 over and over 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.909
 good as you see it has no light 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.829
 not only a very weak light that 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.590
 here from my studio in this new task 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.470
 who would never see me again and now I will 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.310
 turn on the main lighting no one 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.129
 the nation that sits here on my right 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.930
 I got the main lighting 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.730
 So what's going on here, you? 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.319
 you are probably seeing this side 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.780
 illuminated logical course 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.409
 only this very dark side right 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.569
 so it's not cool because one side gets 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.420
 illuminated the other side becomes very dark is 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.629
 then the fill light enters 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.849
 come on , fill it up 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.280
 the fill light in the light a little 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.769
 clearer than the main light but 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.120
 she still leaves a little bit of 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.769
 contrast ne 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720
 on my face it does not light up so much 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.879
 as the main one for 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.950
 leave a little contrast now 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.690
 You can see that my head does not 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.639
 it's lit right 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.290
 If I had black hair, you would not 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.290
 will my hair be mixed with 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.230
 the bottom is then the head light 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.000
 against light is just to do it 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.310
 So I'll call now against the light. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.459
 You see the difference how it gets a bit 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.250
 farther from my infinite background as 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.519
 You may notice the contra- light causing a 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.269
 effect and lights up your head. 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.660
 shoulder hair causing a certain contrast 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.500
 between you in case I and my background 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.760
 defined 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.410
 so this is what I would like to 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.810
 share with you in today's video 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.090
 hope it has helped to improve 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 quality of your video even if you 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.199
 Are you using a camera? 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.299
 The same professional she sang using 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.400
 but with poor lighting your 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.199
 video will still get a quality 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.389
 Bad so invest in a lighting 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.150
 suitable for you to pass an image 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.919
 more professional for your audience and 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.169
