new liquid I have by Mormon
I'm<00:00:06.390> really<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:06.870> who<00:00:07.049> can<00:00:07.350> explain<00:00:07.649> by<00:00:07.830> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
I'm really just who can explain by the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.980 
I'm really just who can explain by the
channels<00:00:08.340> really<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> moment<00:00:09.090> these<00:00:09.780> are

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
channels really at the moment these are

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
channels really at the moment these are
to<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.469> given<00:00:11.300> this<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.480> feels<00:00:12.750> nice<00:00:13.280> supposed

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
to be given this one feels nice supposed

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.499 
to be given this one feels nice supposed
to<00:00:14.340> be<00:00:14.400> classic<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:15.030> but<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
to be classic think but it is a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.109 
to be classic think but it is a
prototype<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.650> know<00:00:17.100> after<00:00:17.730> speaking

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
prototype and I do know after speaking

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.960 
prototype and I do know after speaking
to<00:00:18.619> Diane<00:00:19.619> also<00:00:20.070> obvious<00:00:20.369> speaking<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> Bob

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
to Diane also obvious speaking to Bob

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.370 
to Diane also obvious speaking to Bob
and<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:22.350> has<00:00:22.859> improved<00:00:23.300> before<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.840> should

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and they has improved before that should

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.179 
and they has improved before that should
know<00:00:25.529> surely<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:27.060> doesn't<00:00:27.330> fit<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.189> numbers

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
know surely it doesn't fit the numbers

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.939 
know surely it doesn't fit the numbers
at<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.119> tell<00:00:30.449> yeah<00:00:30.990> different

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
at all as you can tell yeah different

at all as you can tell yeah different
type<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> channel<00:00:32.489> anyway<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.090> didn't<00:00:33.570> expect

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
type of channel anyway I didn't expect

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
type of channel anyway I didn't expect

eager to eager tech ones fit this type
of<00:00:51.390> whacked-out<00:00:51.860> I'm<00:00:52.860> sure<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.340> probably

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of whacked-out I'm sure you can probably

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
of whacked-out I'm sure you can probably
get<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> somehow<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> fix<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.140> much

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
get it somehow to fix it but it's much

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
get it somehow to fix it but it's much
easier<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> use<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.699> as<00:00:59.699> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
easier so it's to use this one as you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
easier so it's to use this one as you
can<00:00:59.850> see<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.629> putting<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.100> do

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
can see not putting at all all you do

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.039 
can see not putting at all all you do
have<00:01:02.609> unloosen<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.480> sequence<00:01:03.870> I'll

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
have unloosen this just sequence I'll

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.770 
have unloosen this just sequence I'll
see<00:01:04.760> you<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:05.970> drill<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> hole<00:01:06.390> straight

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
see you just drill a hole straight

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
see you just drill a hole straight
through<00:01:06.930> you'll<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.890> anyway<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
through you'll see that anyway on the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
through you'll see that anyway on the
existing<00:01:08.880> wait<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:10.970> time<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.299> cut<00:01:13.290> these

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
existing wait now time that up cut these

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.050 
existing wait now time that up cut these
two<00:01:13.680> lengths<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:16.189> no<00:01:17.189> problems<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.670> all

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.880 

our<00:01:21.060> guts<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:21.570> through<00:01:21.899> quickly<00:01:22.079> as<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:22.530> or

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
our guts go through quickly as well or

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
our guts go through quickly as well or
have<00:01:23.159> done<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> I've<00:01:23.759> used<00:01:23.969> all<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.329> different

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
have done it I've used all the different

have done it I've used all the different
types<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:25.799> I've<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:25.950> razor<00:01:26.310> in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
types you can see here I've got razor in

types you can see here I've got razor in
here<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.719> always<00:01:27.899> read<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.530> thing's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
here don't I always read this thing's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.080 
here don't I always read this thing's
great<00:01:29.009> rubber<00:01:30.229> I've<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.530> found<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.939> very<00:01:32.939> good

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
great rubber I've not found it very good

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.810 
great rubber I've not found it very good
on<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.679> channel<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.310> seems<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> like

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
on this this channel it seems to like

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.789 
on this this channel it seems to like
the<00:01:35.939> harder<00:01:36.270> channel<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.810> haven't<00:01:37.319> tried<00:01:37.439> back

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the harder channel I haven't tried back

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.940 
the harder channel I haven't tried back
now<00:01:38.069> which<00:01:38.399> I<00:01:38.520> reckon<00:01:38.819> as<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> harlot<00:01:39.210> wrinkled

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
now which I reckon as a harlot wrinkled

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.669 
now which I reckon as a harlot wrinkled
challenge<00:01:40.950> definitely<00:01:41.100> would<00:01:42.409> more<00:01:43.409> than<00:01:43.439> one

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
challenge definitely would more than one

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.740 
challenge definitely would more than one
actually<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.340> very<00:01:44.520> good<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.000> quite<00:01:45.390> hard

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
actually is very good it's quite hard

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.249 
actually is very good it's quite hard
not<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.799> part<00:01:47.039> but<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.280> harder<00:01:47.610> than<00:01:47.640> me<00:01:48.259> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
not to part but it's harder than me the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
not to part but it's harder than me the
face<00:01:49.469> of<00:01:49.679> one<00:01:49.890> that's<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.509> just

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
face of one that's the only thing I just

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.210 
face of one that's the only thing I just
found<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.349> when<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.530> doing<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.950> he<00:01:52.979> just

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
found that when I was doing it he just

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.499 
found that when I was doing it he just
started<00:01:53.429> to<00:01:53.549> chatter<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.060> bit

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.460 

otherwise<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.569> might<00:01:57.780> even<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.349> he'll

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
otherwise I might even get that he'll

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.830 
otherwise I might even get that he'll
never<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.770> comply<00:01:59.130> rather<00:01:59.369> than<00:01:59.549> later

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
never know comply rather than later

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.439 
never know comply rather than later
that's<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.289> about
