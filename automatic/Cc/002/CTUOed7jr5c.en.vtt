here is set up the Rico Universal print

your printer for example if you have a

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.299 
your printer for example if you have a
finishing<00:00:11.849> unit<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.620> right<00:00:13.620> now<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.920> can't

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
use the options on the finishing unit

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.279 
use the options on the finishing unit
this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.760> probably<00:00:18.330> why<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.630> first<00:00:19.170> thing
