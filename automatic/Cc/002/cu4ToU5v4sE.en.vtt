whatever you want to pronounce it um so

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.760 
whatever you want to pronounce it um so
yeah<00:00:22.300> as<00:00:22.720> you<00:00:22.900> can<00:00:22.930> see<00:00:23.170> here<00:00:23.349> we've<00:00:23.500> got<00:00:23.529> an

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
yeah as you can see here we've got an

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.850 
yeah as you can see here we've got an
Xbox<00:00:24.160> controller<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:25.510> the<00:00:25.780> new<00:00:25.900> fifa<00:00:26.110> 14<00:00:26.440> you

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
Xbox controller in the new fifa 14 you

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.359 
Xbox controller in the new fifa 14 you
do<00:00:27.010> not<00:00:27.250> have<00:00:27.520> to<00:00:27.880> use<00:00:28.480> LT<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.740> do<00:00:29.830> skill<00:00:30.130> moves

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
do not have to use LT to do skill moves

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.729 
do not have to use LT to do skill moves
instead<00:00:31.270> you<00:00:31.420> only<00:00:31.600> have<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.900> use<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.320> right

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
instead you only have to use the right

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.420 
instead you only have to use the right
analog<00:00:33.100> stick<00:00:33.280> um<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.530> waka<00:00:35.710> waka<00:00:35.920> is<00:00:36.280> a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
analog stick um but the waka waka is a

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.000 
analog stick um but the waka waka is a
very<00:00:36.730> advanced<00:00:37.420> skill<00:00:37.750> move<00:00:38.050> so<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.650> requires

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
very advanced skill move so it requires

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.880 
very advanced skill move so it requires
the<00:00:39.460> right<00:00:40.210> analog<00:00:40.449> stick<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.620> left

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
the right analog stick and the left

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.549 
the right analog stick and the left
analog<00:00:42.160> stick<00:00:42.399> and<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:44.140> really<00:00:44.320> not<00:00:44.440> that

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
analog stick and it's really not that

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.680 
analog stick and it's really not that
hard<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.890> pull<00:00:45.100> off<00:00:45.250> um<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.090> hardest

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
hard to pull off um the the hardest

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.610 
hard to pull off um the the hardest
thing<00:00:46.930> about<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.620> timing<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.480> as<00:00:50.320> you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
thing about it is the timing so as you

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.860 
thing about it is the timing so as you
can<00:00:50.680> see<00:00:50.860> here<00:00:51.130> you<00:00:51.489> just<00:00:51.700> start<00:00:51.940> off<00:00:52.090> by<00:00:52.690> going

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
can see here you just start off by going

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.260 
can see here you just start off by going
there<00:00:53.050> there<00:00:53.770> there<00:00:54.070> there<00:00:54.370> or<00:00:55.030> somewhere

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
there there there there or somewhere

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.959 
there there there there or somewhere
where<00:00:55.450> you<00:00:55.570> can<00:00:55.690> go<00:00:55.809> 90<00:00:56.710> degrees<00:00:57.100> from<00:00:57.399> in<00:00:57.640> a

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
where you can go 90 degrees from in a

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.030 
where you can go 90 degrees from in a
circle<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:58.840> let's<00:00:59.079> say<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.200> start<00:00:59.290> there<00:00:59.770> and<00:00:59.800> I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
circle so let's say I start there and I

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.069 
circle so let's say I start there and I
want<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.460> go<00:01:00.610> towards<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.360> right<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.690> would<00:01:01.960> go

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
want to go towards the right I would go

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.639 
want to go towards the right I would go
there<00:01:02.320> up<00:01:03.479> 90<00:01:04.479> degrees<00:01:04.960> towards<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.470> right

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
there up 90 degrees towards the right

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.710 
there up 90 degrees towards the right
and<00:01:05.800> then<00:01:06.009> go<00:01:06.190> like<00:01:06.310> this<00:01:06.430> right<00:01:07.270> there<00:01:07.479> so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
and then go like this right there so

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.040 
and then go like this right there so
it'd<00:01:07.810> be<00:01:07.840> like<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.270> go<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.660> the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
it'd be like that that so I go to the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.919 
it'd be like that that so I go to the
side<00:01:11.320> up<00:01:12.009> towards<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.850> left<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.300> 90<00:01:13.569> degrees

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
side up towards the left and 90 degrees

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.570 
side up towards the left and 90 degrees
and<00:01:14.140> then<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.440> would<00:01:14.740> use<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.100> left<00:01:15.369> analog

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
and then I would use the left analog

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.249 
and then I would use the left analog
stick<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:16.209> go<00:01:16.420> towards<00:01:17.200> left<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:18.069> um<00:01:18.910> so<00:01:19.360> I<00:01:20.020> want

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
stick to go towards left so um so I want

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.669 
stick to go towards left so um so I want
to<00:01:20.350> go<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.619> left<00:01:20.800> it<00:01:20.950> would<00:01:21.009> be<00:01:21.100> like<00:01:21.190> this

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
to go to the left it would be like this

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.290 
to go to the left it would be like this
that's<00:01:23.679> that's<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.250> gun<00:01:24.459> in<00:01:24.580> full<00:01:24.819> speed<00:01:25.149> and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
that's that's it gun in full speed and

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.969 
that's that's it gun in full speed and
in<00:01:25.420> slow<00:01:25.750> motion<00:01:26.080> it's<00:01:26.530> done<00:01:26.890> like<00:01:27.099> that<00:01:28.979> so

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
in slow motion it's done like that so

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.440 
in slow motion it's done like that so
yeah<00:01:30.250> as<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.700> see<00:01:30.910> if<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.119> want<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.330> go<00:01:31.390> to

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
yeah as you can see if you want to go to

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.240 
yeah as you can see if you want to go to
the<00:01:31.569> right<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.050> just<00:01:32.200> go<00:01:32.410> just<00:01:33.009> do<00:01:33.099> the<00:01:33.190> same

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
the right you just go just do the same

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.520 
the right you just go just do the same
thing<00:01:33.580> out<00:01:33.759> up<00:01:34.209> 90<00:01:34.720> degrees<00:01:35.110> towards<00:01:35.440> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
thing out up 90 degrees towards the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.589 
thing out up 90 degrees towards the
right<00:01:35.709> then<00:01:36.220> towards<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.640> right<00:01:36.759> out<00:01:36.970> up<00:01:37.360> 90

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:37.599 
right then towards the right out up 90

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.029 
right then towards the right out up 90
degrees<00:01:37.959> towards<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.289> right<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.649> to<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
degrees towards the right and to the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.040 
degrees towards the right and to the
right<00:01:39.250> if<00:01:39.429> you<00:01:39.490> want<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.670> go<00:01:39.759> downwards<00:01:40.450> out

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
right if you want to go downwards out

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.279 
right if you want to go downwards out
down<00:01:42.039> 90<00:01:42.429> degrees<00:01:42.729> down<00:01:43.209> out<00:01:43.539> downline

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
down 90 degrees down out downline

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.249

degrees up out no yeah out up I don't

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.260 
degrees up out no yeah out up I don't
know<00:01:54.099> it<00:01:54.220> all<00:01:54.369> depends<00:01:54.759> on<00:01:54.940> um<00:01:55.739> yeah<00:01:56.739> so

anyways yeah that's that's how you do it

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.889 
anyways yeah that's that's how you do it
it<00:02:00.459> all<00:02:00.610> depends<00:02:01.030> on<00:02:01.090> where<00:02:01.360> are<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.539> facing

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
it all depends on where are you facing

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.650 
it all depends on where are you facing
as<00:02:02.259> well<00:02:02.440> um<00:02:02.649> it's<00:02:03.580> just<00:02:03.970> watched<00:02:04.420> the

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
as well um it's just watched the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.359 
as well um it's just watched the
examples<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.410> you'll<00:02:05.500> sort<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.860> understand

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
examples and you'll sort of understand

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.130 
examples and you'll sort of understand
what<00:02:06.520> I'm<00:02:06.610> saying<00:02:06.849> it<00:02:07.300> all<00:02:07.450> depends<00:02:07.810> on<00:02:07.899> where

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140

you it all depends on where you're
facing<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:10.179> you're<00:02:10.330> doing<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.599> skill<00:02:10.869> move

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
facing when you're doing this skill move

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.430 
facing when you're doing this skill move
so<00:02:11.709> um<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:13.239> yeah<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:13.840> here<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.319> a

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
so um and it's yeah so here we have a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.740 
so um and it's yeah so here we have a
ps3<00:02:14.770> controller<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.000> same<00:02:16.239> just<00:02:16.540> going

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
ps3 controller it's the same just going

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.780 
ps3 controller it's the same just going
the<00:02:16.840> right<00:02:16.989> analog<00:02:17.319> stick<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.189> 90

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the right analog stick and out 90

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.190 
the right analog stick and out 90
degrees<00:02:18.819> up<00:02:19.269> then

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
degrees up then

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.339 
degrees up then
on<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.160> left<00:02:21.370> analog<00:02:21.550> stick<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:22.209> go<00:02:22.450> towards

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
on the left analog stick just go towards

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.110 
on the left analog stick just go towards
the<00:02:23.410> left<00:02:24.129> if<00:02:24.340> you're<00:02:24.459> going<00:02:24.580> towards<00:02:24.849> left

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
the left if you're going towards left

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
the left if you're going towards left
going<00:02:25.750> towards<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.080> right<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.590> go<00:02:26.709> out<00:02:26.950> 90

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
going towards the right just go out 90

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.280 
going towards the right just go out 90
degrees<00:02:27.430> up<00:02:28.239> towards<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.660> right<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.050> then

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
degrees up towards the right and then

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.990 
degrees up towards the right and then
use<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.709> left<00:02:29.920> analog<00:02:30.069> stick<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.610> go<00:02:30.730> towards

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
use the left analog stick to go towards

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.309 
use the left analog stick to go towards
the<00:02:31.060> right<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.480> yeah<00:02:31.629> that's<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:31.930> how<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.140> do

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
the right so yeah that's just how you do

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.759 
the right so yeah that's just how you do
it<00:02:32.440> um<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:34.900> not<00:02:34.959> very<00:02:35.230> hard<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:35.650> all

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
it um but it's not very hard it's all

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.050 
it um but it's not very hard it's all
about<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.220> direction<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.670> you're<00:02:36.819> facing

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
about the direction that you're facing

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.880 
about the direction that you're facing
you'll<00:02:37.390> figure<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.690> out<00:02:37.870> if<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.860> just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
you'll figure it out if you just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.820 
you'll figure it out if you just
practice<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.489> little<00:02:39.610> bit<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.269> in<00:02:40.540> game<00:02:40.870> and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
practice a little bit in the in game and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.500 
practice a little bit in the in game and
it's<00:02:42.160> all<00:02:42.280> about<00:02:42.370> timing<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.030> yeah<00:02:43.269> just

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
it's all about timing so yeah just

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.850 
it's all about timing so yeah just
practice<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.140> once<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.380> get<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.680> looks

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
practice it and once you get it looks

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.979 
practice it and once you get it looks
really<00:02:45.040> really<00:02:45.280> nice<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.610> game<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.120> it'll<00:02:46.840> be

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
really really nice in game and it'll be

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.280 
really really nice in game and it'll be
pretty<00:02:47.319> useful<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:48.040> yeah
