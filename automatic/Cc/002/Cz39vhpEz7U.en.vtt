00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
able to come out and explode now when

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.920 
able to come out and explode now when
you<00:00:34.649> drive<00:00:34.920> lock<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.880> important<00:00:36.390> thing<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
you drive lock the important thing is to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.380 
you drive lock the important thing is to
keep<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.739> your<00:00:37.950> weight<00:00:38.430> underneath<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
keep all your weight underneath you and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.130 
keep all your weight underneath you and
to<00:00:39.780> take<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.670> half<00:00:41.670> step<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.899> say

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
to take that first half step and I say

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
to take that first half step and I say
half<00:00:43.350> step<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> should<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.280> too<00:00:44.460> long

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
half step because it should get too long

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.029 
half step because it should get too long
in<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> long<00:00:45.180> step<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> he<00:00:45.960> steps<00:00:46.260> across<00:00:46.469> your

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
in a long step and he steps across your

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.010 
in a long step and he steps across your
you're<00:00:47.340> caught<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.879> you're<00:00:48.329> stood<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you're caught and you're stood up and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.770 
you're caught and you're stood up and
then<00:00:49.620> he's<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> advantage<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.570> key

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
then he's got the advantage so the key

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.810 
then he's got the advantage so the key
to<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> drive<00:00:52.320> block<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> take<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.489> step

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
to a drive block is take that first step

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
to a drive block is take that first step
and<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.510> he<00:00:54.600> takes<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.989> first<00:00:55.260> step<00:00:55.469> up

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and so when he takes this first step up

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.619 
and so when he takes this first step up
then<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.550> explode<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> long

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
then you can explode it up with a long

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.330 
then you can explode it up with a long
one<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.440> come<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.920> through<00:00:59.160> his

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
one there and come up through his

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
one there and come up through his
shoulder<00:00:59.850> pads<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.809> control<00:01:01.260> them<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
shoulder pads here and control them and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
shoulder pads here and control them and
then<00:01:02.010> once<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> step<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.390> you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
then once you get that step in then you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960 
then once you get that step in then you
try<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> keep<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.409> feet<00:01:04.769> moving<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.700> try<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
try to keep your feet moving and try to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760 
try to keep your feet moving and try to
tip<00:01:06.360> him<00:01:06.540> either<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.930> he<00:01:07.110> wants<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.710> he
