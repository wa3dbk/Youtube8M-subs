00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.700

 then put in the pan with 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.570
 but if you do in the oven in 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 a little oil on it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.740
 fresh garlic then herbs 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.600
 in the oven let it draw 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.759
 then go the flavors of the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.720
 booked herbs in the fish pure and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:49.110

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.140

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.290
 cook or is legend 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.480
 So I think so because the concentrate 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.580
 he only did that deliciously 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.380
 when the liquid evaporates like 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.030
 the slower the cook the longer you get 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.940
 Takes the stronger tomatoes again 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.010
 taste so slow to get on 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.940

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.940

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.490
