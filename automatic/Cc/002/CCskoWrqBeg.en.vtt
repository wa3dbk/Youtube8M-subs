 it was erased maybe we eliminated it or what 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.430
 to be 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.110

 Hi, I'm here 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.260
 The first thing we are going to do is to have 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.170
 our cell phone turned on and the cable 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 data connected to the computer 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.110
 to the laptop or the computer as 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.020
 that you have 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 but not connected to the cell phone only when 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.040
 computer data cable 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.210
 and the phone on battery 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.190
 full 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.810
 at least more than half what 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.240
 enough to support the pleasure 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.880
 true 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.700
 ready the first thing we are going to do is to 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.700
 download the firmware 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.270
 team in this case and not 303 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.340
 touch 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.549
 here we have it truth what we are going to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.549
 do 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.520
 and we are going to 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.330
 in this folder 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.270
 here we have it 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.270
 to flash we need the program 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.810
 wines 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.209
 in this case we are going to do this we are 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.910
 that bieber this over phoenix 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.720
 once well installed and everything and we give 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.400
 open the location of the file 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.790
 once we are here we give each 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790
 bridge 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.370
 being here we give to all 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.300
 and here as you can see I already brought it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.030
 her program 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.090
 but to see it again and I'm going to 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.030
 do this 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.150
 Amen 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.830
 to the compressed file we move it to 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.840
 this side 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.840
 to ask for permission we read and continue 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.370
 but bouquets 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.890
 something we go to where we have the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.890
 direct access 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.000
 we execute it as administrator and that 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.000
 yes 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.050
 we hope that itself 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.459
 Once the program is open, we give ourselves 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.350
 here where it says file we click we put 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.569
 open products 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.480
 and we choose rm 763 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.470
 we are OK 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.130
 where it says flying 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.400
 and we left put firmware update we give 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.400
 click 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.420
 and then we go from here where are these 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.420
 three ellipses 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.970
 we choose from the file we put ok 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.800
 we put diphthong ui sb flashing and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.470
 we are left over 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.250
 once we are here we will do what 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.770
 next connect the usb cable in the 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.750
 phone 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.430
 they do not disconnect it from the computer in 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.650
 no time since I told them 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.140
 truth connect it to the cell phone that is 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.799
 on and with the battery full and of 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.579
 there we are going to click here on sw reset 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.769
 from that 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.349
 and they're going to do the following thing they 're going to 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.210
 appear a box that will make 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.909
 these instructions but to you 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.550
 they appear in English but they already 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:34.159
 I translated so that they understand the first 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.689
 says disconnect the usb cable from the cell 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:41.360
 not the pc or the cell phone the 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.300
 usb entry, no cell phone 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.830
 then we disconnect what we are going to 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.620
 to do is to remove the battery from 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.289
 we uncover it, remove the 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.070
 battery reconnect the usb cable 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.840
 to the cell phone 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.139
 again we make the connection if the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.060
 drums 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.740
 the fourth is to insert the 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.220
 battery in the cell phone with the cable 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.040
 connected 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.690
 5 press the power button on the 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.610
 we press it and here we do not 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.030
 will appear an ace lyricists down 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.650
 so after that we press here in 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.500
 the dialog box that is in English 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.760
 we accept you here, I do not know why 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.580
 where it comes out we accept 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.560
 Y 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.629
 we press the power button on the 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.750
 cellular to start the player 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.639
 once we do this class starts 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.479
 we automatically start to see here that 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:35.360
 it runs in percentage for example 10% 20% 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.580
 30 40 and from there we leave you until 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.280
 fully finished everything as we know 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.460
 when it's totally finished all because 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.500
 our Nokia is going to restart and goes to 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.930
 turn on and it will put us as of 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.569
 factory then from there where we're going to 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.380
 have the silver nokia 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:57.900
 and running everything well 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.420
 that was it and I really hope 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.740
 Any doubt write to me in the 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.270
 comments that I will be willing to 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.670
 answer any questions that you 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.760

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.760
 helped
