00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.539
 in this simple video you will see how 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.480
 we prepare a lobster on the grill 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:19.180
 this lobster has some shades 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.430
 blues and a white flip and that's why 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.220
 we will recognize that it is a lobster 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.740
 national means in Spanish or of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.950
 the Spanish coasts 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.169
 when we open it, we will remove the part of the 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.490
 inner eye that is called is a small 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.770
 aduriz since he is in that part 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.760
 because it's not nice to eat and if 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.290
 I had guts 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.370
 let's look good if I had guts 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.370
 I would be inside 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.890
 how are we going to cook it on the grill what 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.690
 What we are going to do is break along with 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.789
 the tweezers so that later it is more 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.089
 easy to eat and we do not have to throw 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.710
 both of seafood tongs or of 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.450
 pliers and even 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 we have to try to open what we are 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.890
 empty as little as possible 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.190
 this has come out quite full is a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.410
 male 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.350
 sometimes I might have more 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.330
 watery content inside and we were 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.850
 easy more but this has come out quite 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.770
 full and you will only notice in the weight of the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 animal because it weighs a lot 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.140
 as you see is alive then to throw 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.440
 salt then react 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.350
 we are going to use an olive oil 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.729
 extra virgin to cook it because 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.430
 It is a product of such quality 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.870
 well it deserves at least this is a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.820
 very good oil 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.870
 have a drink of oil and a drink 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.340
 of oil 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.340
 let's cut the commas of the tweezers 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.000
 and we are going to take it to the plate 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.490
 [Music] 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.189
 she 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.930
 as you see, we mark it first by the 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.720
 part of the meat down and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.479
 We hold on the part of the head to 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.820
 that we are not emptied in this way 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.940
 juices 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.979
 they will concentrate and not to seal 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.610
 so that none of the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.290
 indoor games of the head 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.480
 Now I'm going to cut with scissors the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.960
 tweezers because they're going to need a little 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.540
 more cooked 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.750
 [Music] 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.849
 the tweezers remember they are chopped them 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.490
 matter a blow and we are going to leave you a 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.860
 little more time on the grill 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.110
 when we stretch timely and past ones 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.330
 5 minutes we will turn our 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.500
 lobsters we will use one more trickle 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.569
 of oil 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.569
 [Music] 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.060
 how can we check the point then 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.190
 putting your finger inside in the flesh of 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.440
 the head when we notice that it is already 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.440
 warm inside and remove it 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.150
 the pints as it was done we will leave them a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.150
 more 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.159
 and now we are going to chop you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.190
 I like to present them respecting the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.959
 animal shapes if we heat a 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.750
 little the dishes previously in the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.780
 microwaves are much better it will take longer 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.260
 time to cool down 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.620
 As you can see, I know him respecting the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.620
 shape 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.730
 to each half I'm going to put his clamp 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.650
 this flyer that is asking you are the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.170
 600 grams for two people 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.990
 would be fine as a good starter if 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.190
 I'm not much to eat as a main course 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.650
 Now what I'm doing is reviewing 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.320
 a little bit all the hard parts the elbows 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.590
 the clues that could have been left 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.510
 without without party 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.000
 [Music] 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.640
 support to have more strength hand 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.830
 on the counter knife edge 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.090
 and so it came down 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.560
 [Music] 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.130
 we almost have it 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.740
 [Music] 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.930
 As you can see the hard parts 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.890
 to make it easier to eat them and 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.650
 Now what I'm going to do is going to be 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.170
 sprinkle it with a splash of oil 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.170
 extra virgin olive oil 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.370
 that is going very well 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.950
 do not cook it, it's a lot, do not cook it 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.450
 a lot of trying to cook it always in your 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.150
 point and it stays a little raw a lot 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.370
 better then you will enjoy that this 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.560
 animal is very tasty and very rich and what 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.420
 most important is from our coasts 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.920
 [Music] 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.780
 you know when you see it in the 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.460
 dared fishmonger has nothing 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.449
 building take off the weeds 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.449
 and enjoy it
