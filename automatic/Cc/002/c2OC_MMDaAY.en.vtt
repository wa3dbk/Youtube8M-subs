00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.660
 it's my second installment of 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.620
 of my section and we're going to start a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.140
 novata and we also have cristian vineyard 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.720
 that his third his third concentration 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 and has suffered the odd hazing 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.980
 good as how do you see it going to suffer 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 much or how you experienced it your first year 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 well I was lucky because inside 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.650
 my plays were not very serious because 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.650
 I can dance what 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.850
 that was not very hard for me then what about 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.560
 know what the pre-fats are 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.260
 player to that I think you're going to have 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.190
 nine balls each one of them and so 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.289
 others very well 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 as you see it, you have a little 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.180
 scrupulous what to take the city clothes 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.310
 good 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:28.760
 and I do not think 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.970
 I do not know if you have noticed but anna cross 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.460
 has created a new style 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.230
 with the look of the selection I'm going to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.660
 put a vote 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:56.340
 one of the hazing is that if in the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:59.010
 debut of a point then here a small 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.390
 shaved a little punky I think that general 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.640
 could do with a new 20 here 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.310
 years sure that your whole life took the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 same hairstyle because it's already time to 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.650
 change I propose a shaved and then 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.950
 then tune it a little color some 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.950
 colour 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.260
 next year 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.770
 Well, we ask for the section where 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.290
 are your cracks and see if this year 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.120
 Well, we have a bit of luck 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.120
 We will be where it deserves us
