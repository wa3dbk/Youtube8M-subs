their<00:00:00.870> first<00:00:01.050> step<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.589> creating<00:00:01.829> our<00:00:02.310> swing

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
their first step to creating our swing

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.079 
their first step to creating our swing
card<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.210> too<00:00:04.220> I've<00:00:05.220> created<00:00:05.520> myself<00:00:05.790> a

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
card is too I've created myself a

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.419 
card is too I've created myself a
template<00:00:06.450> but<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:07.049> cut<00:00:07.290> out<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.620> actual<00:00:07.950> card

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
template but to cut out the actual card

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.270 
template but to cut out the actual card
body<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:11.179> when<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.780> card<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.500> functioning

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
body so when the card is is functioning

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.340 
body so when the card is is functioning
it<00:00:14.400> looks<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.470> but<00:00:17.000> if<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.210> unfold<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
it looks like this but if I unfold it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.429 
it looks like this but if I unfold it
completely<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:22.260> just

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
completely you can see that we just

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.330 
completely you can see that we just
start<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.189> piece<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.699> paper<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:25.340> it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
start with a piece of paper and it's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400 
start with a piece of paper and it's
actually<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:27.990> dimensions

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
actually I would have all my dimensions

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.290 
actually I would have all my dimensions
written<00:00:28.619> down<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.279> card<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> seven<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
written down here the card is seven and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.280 
written down here the card is seven and
three-fourths<00:00:31.099> lawn<00:00:32.600> by<00:00:33.600> six<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> half

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
three-fourths lawn by six and a half

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.549 
three-fourths lawn by six and a half
inches<00:00:34.530> tall<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:37.140> using<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
inches tall so we're going to be using a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.170 
inches tall so we're going to be using a
paper<00:00:37.739> template<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> cut<00:00:38.730> out<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.030> myself

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
paper template that I cut out for myself

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.100 
paper template that I cut out for myself
and<00:00:40.190> we're<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.809> tracing<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.870> out

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and we're going to be tracing that out

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170 
and we're going to be tracing that out
using<00:00:43.379> our<00:00:43.649> tannic<00:00:43.980> paper<00:00:44.219> cutter<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.850> order

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
using our tannic paper cutter in order

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.229 
using our tannic paper cutter in order
to<00:00:45.649> cut<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
to cut that so that's what I'm going to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.250 
to cut that so that's what I'm going to
do<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.750> card<00:00:51.750> stock<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
do here so I have my card stock that I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
do here so I have my card stock that I
want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.649> use<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.340> double<00:00:53.760> sided<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
want to use and it's double sided it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.630 
want to use and it's double sided it
should<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:55.219> corresponding<00:00:56.219> patterns

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
should be corresponding patterns

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
should be corresponding patterns
actually<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.079> pieces<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.469> paper

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
actually this is two pieces of paper

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
actually this is two pieces of paper
glued<00:00:59.460> together<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.350> was

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
glued together and it is it was

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.729 
glued together and it is it was
originally<00:01:02.070> double-sided<00:01:02.930> paper<00:01:03.930> which

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
originally double-sided paper which

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.109 
originally double-sided paper which
tends<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.519> heavier<00:01:06.060> than

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
tends to be a little bit heavier than

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
tends to be a little bit heavier than
just<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> single<00:01:07.020> sided<00:01:07.380> printed<00:01:07.830> paper<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
just a single sided printed paper so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880 
just a single sided printed paper so
I've<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.210> double<00:01:09.900> sided<00:01:10.110> pieces<00:01:10.650> put

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I've got to double sided pieces put

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.210 
I've got to double sided pieces put
together<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:12.260> I've<00:01:13.260> made<00:01:13.530> myself<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.100> little

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
together and I've made myself a little

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.330 
together and I've made myself a little
paper<00:01:14.580> template<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.770> I've<00:01:16.770> also<00:01:16.950> cut<00:01:17.400> myself

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
paper template and I've also cut myself

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
paper template and I've also cut myself
one<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> center<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
one for the center which is just this is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.179 
one for the center which is just this is
a<00:01:22.110> 4<00:01:22.439> by<00:01:22.619> 4<00:01:22.650> square<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> card<00:01:25.560> itself<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
a 4 by 4 square so the card itself is

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520 
a 4 by 4 square so the card itself is
seven<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.240> three-quarters<00:01:27.780> inches<00:01:28.080> by<00:01:28.259> six

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
seven and three-quarters inches by six

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.359 
seven and three-quarters inches by six
and<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> half<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.869> I'm<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.290> use<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.860> so

cutter<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.130> great<00:02:33.459> because<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.000> cuts<00:02:34.209> with

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
cutter is great because it cuts with

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.190 
cutter is great because it cuts with
friction<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.610> not<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:37.330> blade<00:02:37.660> although

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200

you know chop somebody's finger off if

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.180 
you know chop somebody's finger off if

that<00:02:45.370> though<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.940> then<00:02:46.690> by<00:02:46.959> six<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.770> half

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.810 

okay<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.700> have<00:02:58.030> my<00:02:58.890> template<00:02:59.890> cut<00:03:00.160> out<00:03:00.280> my<00:03:00.550> or

okay so I have my template cut out my or

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
okay so I have my template cut out my or
my<00:03:00.850> card<00:03:01.239> body<00:03:01.480> cut<00:03:01.750> out<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.840> actually

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
my card body cut out and now I actually

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.949 
my card body cut out and now I actually
I<00:03:05.080> could<00:03:05.380> use<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:06.220> center<00:03:06.670> square<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
I could use the center square here but I

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.930 
I could use the center square here but I
did<00:03:08.230> measure<00:03:08.470> out<00:03:08.799> how<00:03:09.070> far<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.459> want<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.850> be

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
did measure out how far I want to be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.100 
did measure out how far I want to be
from<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.330> edge<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.430> my<00:03:12.430> square<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:13.090> two<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.019> a

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
from one edge so my square is two and a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.130 
from one edge so my square is two and a
quarter<00:03:14.290> inches<00:03:14.760> from<00:03:15.760> my<00:03:16.329> right<00:03:16.600> side<00:03:16.870> edge

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
quarter inches from my right side edge

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.449 
quarter inches from my right side edge
and<00:03:18.750> one<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.959> quarter<00:03:20.110> inches<00:03:20.230> from<00:03:21.130> both

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
and one and a quarter inches from both

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.820 
and one and a quarter inches from both
top<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:21.820> bottom<00:03:23.489> so

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.400 

I<00:03:29.570> could

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.710 

okay<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:35.520> I've<00:03:35.700> got<00:03:35.940> my<00:03:36.140> square<00:03:37.140> traced<00:03:37.770> and

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
okay so I've got my square traced and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.300 
okay so I've got my square traced and
actually<00:03:39.720> right<00:03:40.140> here<00:03:40.170> i'm<00:03:40.830> going<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.130> leave

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
actually right here i'm going to leave

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.600 
actually right here i'm going to leave
an<00:03:41.520> open<00:03:41.970> spot<00:03:42.300> because<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.890> where<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
an open spot because that is where the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.970 
an open spot because that is where the
square<00:03:44.940> stays<00:03:45.360> attached<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.290> card<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.860> it

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
square stays attached to the card so it

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.500 
square stays attached to the card so it
can<00:03:47.160> rotate<00:03:48.710> you<00:03:49.710> can<00:03:49.860> see<00:03:50.220> here<00:03:50.910> if<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.180> fold

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
can rotate you can see here if I fold

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.950 
can rotate you can see here if I fold
both<00:03:52.020> of<00:03:52.260> these<00:03:52.380> back<00:03:52.710> so<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.640> want<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.300> leave

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
both of these back so you want to leave

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.250 
both of these back so you want to leave
it<00:03:55.110> attached<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.520> one<00:03:57.200> solid<00:03:58.200> piece<00:04:00.260> so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
it attached this is one solid piece so

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.470 
it attached this is one solid piece so
when<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.440> fold<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.100> way<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.850> that's<00:04:03.330> how

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
when I fold it this way and that's how

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.390 
when I fold it this way and that's how
your<00:04:03.900> card<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.320> able<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.740> swing<00:04:04.950> or<00:04:05.160> your

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
your card is able to swing or your

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.100 
your card is able to swing or your
middle<00:04:05.940> piece<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.360> little<00:04:06.660> swing<00:04:06.870> back<00:04:07.080> and

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
middle piece is a little swing back and

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.740 
middle piece is a little swing back and
forth<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:08.250> actually<00:04:09.060> if<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.270> want<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.630> make

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
forth and actually if you want to make

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.550 
forth and actually if you want to make
yourself<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:10.350> four-by-four<00:04:12.230> template<00:04:13.230> for<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
yourself a four-by-four template for the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.140 
yourself a four-by-four template for the
center<00:04:14.100> just<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.490> make<00:04:14.640> sure<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:15.000> you're

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
center just to make sure that you're

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.210 
center just to make sure that you're
going<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.780> be<00:04:15.930> scoring<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.680> at<00:04:16.950> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
going to be scoring it at the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.000 
going to be scoring it at the
right-center<00:04:17.430> parts<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:19.380> can<00:04:19.410> do<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.859> as

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
right-center parts you can do that as

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.710 
right-center parts you can do that as
well<00:04:20.040> so<00:04:22.070> I'm<00:04:23.070> just<00:04:23.310> double-checking<00:04:23.720> myself

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
well so I'm just double-checking myself

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:34.070 
well so I'm just double-checking myself
because<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.730> am<00:04:26.730> human<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:32.000> as<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.210> look<00:04:33.420> at<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
because I am human and as I look at the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:43.250 
because I am human and as I look at the
face<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.380> my<00:04:34.830> card<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.490> want<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:40.020> end<00:04:42.140> now<00:04:43.140> I'm

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
face of my card I want this end now I'm

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.760 
face of my card I want this end now I'm
confusing<00:04:43.680> myself<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:44.310> want<00:04:45.240> this<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:46.290> be<00:04:46.530> a

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
confusing myself I want this to be a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.210 
confusing myself I want this to be a
peek<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.640> first<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.660> be<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> peek<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:50.010> that

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
peek the first to be a peek so that

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.030 
peek the first to be a peek so that
means<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.669> crease<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.180> going<00:04:51.510> down<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.200> then

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
means the crease is going down and then

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.400 
means the crease is going down and then
I<00:04:53.460> want<00:04:53.730> this<00:04:54.000> one<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.450> be<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.690> valley<00:04:55.050> which

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
I want this one to be a valley which

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.360 
I want this one to be a valley which
means<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.919> crease<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.370> being<00:04:56.610> folded<00:04:56.880> up<00:04:57.950> so<00:04:58.950> I

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
means the crease is being folded up so I

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.060 
means the crease is being folded up so I
have<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.540> first<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:01.020> be<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.140> peek<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.710> second

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
have the first to be a peek the second

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.340 
have the first to be a peek the second
to<00:05:02.190> be<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.340> valley<00:05:02.640> as<00:05:03.000> I'm<00:05:03.780> looking<00:05:03.930> at<00:05:04.200> the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
to be a valley as I'm looking at the
