00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 what I have in my hands is a 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.710
 full-length reflex a reflex often 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.540
 qualified professional 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 Well there is even a range above 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.230
 even more extraordinary devices 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.640
 many much rarer these 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.930
 devices is called the average formats 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.039
 and today I was talking about pentax 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.689
 645d help 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.689
 nicknamed the bazooka 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.320
 1 kg 5 on the scale it's sure it's 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.910
 not a compact but what really makes 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.480
 the difference from a reflex 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.700
 traditional 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.200
 it's not just how big it is 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.640
 very very big SLR for 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.750
 sports photographers for example 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.060
 so what really makes the difference 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.590
 and its sensor it's an average sensor 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.210
 format as surprising as it may 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.739
 to appear the fourteen medium formats 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.680
 are bigger than the full sensor 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.540
 format back to the express labs just 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.400
 to explain to you what a means 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.200
 format when we talk about average device 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.280
 format we talk about the size of the sensor 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.000
 absolutely not the size of 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.710
 the device itself 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.570
 so to give you a bit of an idea of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.369
 scale the sizes and 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.060
 various sensors cameras 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.619
 we can use 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.509
 we start with the smartphone as you 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 can see him a 14 martin this is 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.150
 really everything very little what is 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.680
 very logical since the front lens 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.350
 is she so small 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.650
 a little bit bigger or better 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.090
 bigger olympus hybrids 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.940
 panasonic same kodak uses the standard 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.970
 micro 4/3 size above we have the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.590
 sensor 10 aps c these sensors that team 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.240
 the reflexes that you use at 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.840
 daily here is that of a nikon 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.280
 d5100 the flagship sensor of the devices 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.950
 professional photos it's the sensor 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.259
 full size it's this kind of sensors 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.119
 which team includes canon eos 5d mark 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.979
 ii objects in the hand a device all 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.890
 to actually professional and well the pentax 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.619
 645d of a sensor that is medium format 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.170
 that is to say that offers a surface 70% 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.670
 bigger and with this large area 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.250
 we are able to spend a lot more 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 pixels a definition greater than 50 and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.560
 1 megapixel in this big thing 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.290
 then at 8000 euros the bare case for 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.270
 that they made this kind of device 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.590
 photo of course they professionals 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.910
 who really need a very 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.590
 great picture definition 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.900
 finally the four sometimes you see 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.850
 in commercials or in the street that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.380
 dress clothes are definition 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.610
 the draws completely gigantic bed 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.630
 also fans of the beautiful image 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.830
 we know very well that the devices 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.800
 professionals are essentially 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.300
 bought by people quite rich and 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.980
 passionate about photography either if they have the 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.500
 luck the two who are looking 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.370
 of a rendering a little different from that of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.930
 full-length reflex 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.610
 because the depth of field on the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.600
 medium sizes and even finer than 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.610
 the one we have on SLRs 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.709
 professional is it worth it 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.120
 the answer is probably yes if you 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.160
 have the budget because the quality 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.540
 image is almost impossible to 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.000
 reach with a traditional SLR 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.320
 as to whether it is for you 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.180
 first you will ask your 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.950
 banker and he'll have to question 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.910
 your back and your country to the arm for 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.480
 to know if you really want to 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.480
 to walk with that
