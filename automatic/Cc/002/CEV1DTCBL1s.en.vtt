bit because I've always wondered you
know<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:33.000> potted<00:00:33.899> dualities<00:00:34.610> since<00:00:35.610> they've

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
know with potted dualities since they've

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.680 
know with potted dualities since they've
came<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.980> always<00:00:37.980> thought<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.370> deck<00:00:38.690> had

here<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.820> I'll<00:01:29.939> explain<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.500> first<00:01:31.740> let<00:01:32.400> me

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
here that I'll explain but first let me

here that I'll explain but first let me
start<00:01:32.610> off<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.329> final<00:01:33.600> countdown<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.950> its

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
start off with final countdown what its

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.130 
start off with final countdown what its
effect<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.119> pay<00:01:36.270> 2,000<00:01:36.810> Life<00:01:36.930> Points

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
effect is is you pay 2,000 Life Points

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
effect is is you pay 2,000 Life Points
after<00:01:37.590> 20<00:01:37.920> turns<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.460> passed<00:01:38.900> counting<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
after 20 turns have passed counting the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.310 
after 20 turns have passed counting the
trendy<00:01:40.320> activate<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.770> card<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.960> win<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
trendy activate this card you win the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.219 
trendy activate this card you win the
duel<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.100> pretty<00:01:44.340> much<00:01:44.430> at<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.509> end<00:01:45.810> phase<00:01:46.020> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
duel so pretty much at the end phase of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830 
duel so pretty much at the end phase of
each<00:01:46.380> turn<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.490> count<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:47.909> from<00:01:48.090> 20<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> 1

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
each turn you count down from 20 to 1

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
each turn you count down from 20 to 1
and<00:01:49.189> r<00:01:50.189> 0<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.880> guess<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.680> win<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.549> win

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and r 0 I guess and you win it's a win

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.609 
and r 0 I guess and you win it's a win
condition<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.540> an<00:01:54.630> effect<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.229> pretty

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
condition it's not an effect I'm pretty

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.460 
condition it's not an effect I'm pretty
sure

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
sure

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.140 
sure
so<00:01:58.470> like<00:01:58.800> refpanel<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.940> would<00:02:00.060> have

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
so like refpanel I think you would have

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.580 
so like refpanel I think you would have
to<00:02:00.270> activate<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.720> at<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.900> beginning<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.470> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to activate it at the beginning but you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.200 
to activate it at the beginning but you
can't<00:02:01.800> activate<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.220> obviously<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.790> 20th

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
can't activate it obviously on the 20th

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.200 
can't activate it obviously on the 20th
turn<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:05.190> yeah<00:02:05.580> it's<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.000> fun<00:02:06.510> deck<00:02:07.260> in<00:02:07.500> terms<00:02:07.770> of

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
turn so yeah it's a fun deck in terms of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.960 
turn so yeah it's a fun deck in terms of
waiting<00:02:09.210> as<00:02:09.530> fun<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:10.560> waiting<00:02:11.160> can<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.550> pretty

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
waiting as fun as waiting can be pretty

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
I'm sure you guys have seen a deck

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.870 
I'm sure you guys have seen a deck
profile<00:02:31.530> before<00:02:31.710> but<00:02:32.070> let<00:02:32.190> me<00:02:32.220> explain<00:02:32.640> some

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
profile before but let me explain some

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.290 
profile before but let me explain some
of<00:02:32.910> my<00:02:33.120> techs<00:02:35.720> see<00:02:36.720> your<00:02:36.959> swift<00:02:37.320> scarecrow<00:02:37.440> is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
of my techs see your swift scarecrow is

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.570 
of my techs see your swift scarecrow is
actually<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.600> best<00:02:39.650> stall<00:02:40.650> card<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.220> this

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
actually the best stall card in this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.300 
actually the best stall card in this
deck<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.390> best<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.560> reason<00:02:43.890> being<00:02:44.010> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
deck the best and the reason being is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.660 
deck the best and the reason being is
because<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.880> almost<00:02:45.209> impossible<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.140> stop

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
because it's almost impossible to stop

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.430 
because it's almost impossible to stop
they're<00:02:47.670> gonna<00:02:47.850> have<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.360> find<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.260> way<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
they're gonna have to find a way to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.400 
they're gonna have to find a way to
negate<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.980> effect<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.580> your<00:02:50.850> hand<00:02:51.209> which<00:02:52.140> is

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
negate the effect in your hand which is

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.860 
negate the effect in your hand which is
very<00:02:53.040> tough<00:02:55.550> but<00:02:56.550> like<00:02:56.880> fader<00:02:57.270> they<00:02:57.660> can

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
very tough but like fader they can

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.830 
very tough but like fader they can
oppression<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.030> solemn<00:03:00.030> warning<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.630> stuff

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
oppression and solemn warning and stuff

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
nice early because like for example

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.800 
nice early because like for example
first<00:04:41.440> turn<00:04:41.770> what<00:04:42.460> what<00:04:42.910> people<00:04:43.210> what<00:04:43.750> you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
should do actually some of the monster

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.909 
should do actually some of the monster
attack<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.540> then<00:04:46.660> proceed<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:47.050> set<00:04:47.350> back<00:04:47.650> row

well<00:04:48.669> this<00:04:48.850> actually<00:04:49.060> skips<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.200> whole<00:04:50.350> back

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
