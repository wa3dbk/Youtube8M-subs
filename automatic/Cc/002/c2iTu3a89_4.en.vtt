00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.590
 we are living a truly changing time beings 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.590
 many humans we have not realized it 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:14.609
 these are the times of the meeting and that we can relate to these 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.679
 beings that we will develop the exopolitics that we will be here for 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.629
 receive them and to fly for them we are really before a world 

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.890
 extraordinary jaime maussan at the metropólitan theater 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 29 January 30 and 31 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.110
 on October 9, 2010 in according to Juan del río in Querétaro was presented 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.330
 one of the so-called night fleets 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.960
 of the best images that we have seen of this phenomenon 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.670
 so I janán days 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.910
 went to that place to be with the witnesses 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.310
 with those who produced the images 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.500
 an absolutely amazing case in refuting will leave days 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.340
 2011 began with a series of sightings of UFO flotillas in 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.049
 various parts of the world 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.439
 which leads us to ask ourselves if we are experiencing a surge at the level 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.409
 planetary 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.810
 because we are already immersed in one of them 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.490
 Mexico is certainly no stranger to these demonstrations since the past 9 of 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.070
 October 2010 was captured this video where you can see a flotilla taken by 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.440
 telecable camera operators querétaro 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.240
 where you can see even that the cars that circulated on the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.080
 Mexico-Querétaro highway does not stop 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.460
 the cars begin to have as seen in the video 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.659
 and they start having a movement was parabolic from left to right like 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.329
 if they were 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.430
 taking off taking height and making a move 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.840
 very common very significant among all ebadí a light a resplendent of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.810
 those very strong objects called is a very dark area and there are no cities 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.970
 close Iese and bright enough as if there was a fire on the sides 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.980
 this material known as the flotilla de san juan del río we see that the 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.120
 first seconds there are many movements of the camera which does not allow us to see 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.440
 to 100% the images of these first 18 that all in question 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.560
 but nevertheless 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.330
 for the study and analysis of the UFO phenomenon this is important in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.410
 first because with these sudden movements we realize immediately 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.230
 that it is not a digital manipulation the flight of aircraft 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.940
 helicopters a little crazy ensures the first instance doctor they had 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.790
 been cantoya balloons soldiers of a wedding unleashes mind but more than 80 is not 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.839
 logical addition this sighting did not report it from apaseo the high 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.310
 and of san miguel allende that are more than 80 to 100 kilometers in a straight line 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.380
 it will be possible that they all stayed together at the same height and at the same 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.089
 speed 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.869
 UFOs that traveled several kilometers and claimed to be dozens of 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.839
 witnesses of this unusual occurrence in those parts of the republic 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.019
 mexican 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.579
 In this video you can see how these luminous objects move 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.340
 right left of the shot 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.560
 freddy pérez in both 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.810
 the slow movement and see what is apparently white wax 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.040
 luminous with a halo of blue color and that seem to maintain a 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.599
 formation that in no time broke 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.720
 however in the second 46 of this clip 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.570
 We notice that when the whole sum is used, we give pacers whitish objects but 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.370
 now with a reddish halo 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.389
 the Queretano researcher assured us that these objects did not produce 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.260
 very solid 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.520
 or are so many objects 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.450
 and if it is clearly seen in the video 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.530
 there is no ice this relationship with a helicopter plane 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.800
 there was no sound that the cameramen so sure heard us 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.150
 no more sound than the light that flowed when questioned about the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.640
 speed and the height that these UFOs kept the researcher lopez us 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.840
 he said they were traveling at a speed of 50 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.630
 at 80 kilometers per hour and at a height of between 150 to 300 meters funeral homes is 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.789
 corroborate that information with control tower 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.719
 just the information is very skeptical part of it is very 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:53.469
 limited 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.939
 for the same drug trafficking by insecurity scare have lately 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:57.909
 very reserved 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.090
 but this one no no there was no report in the nearby area we went to villages 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:06.629
 near the airport called galeras and there was not any this report from 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.150
 the position of the witnesses the objects appeared at a 45 degree angle 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.930
 over the horizon as we can see in this video here 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.680
 it should be emphasized that the apparently most luminous objects are 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.620
 those who are closer to the camera that is capturing them because if 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.290
 we notice 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.850
 there are objects that look less luminous and it seems that they are the ones that are most 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.180
 retired 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.060
 when retracting in his wife, white objects are seen ad3 in a way that spherical 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.200
 in minute two with 26 seconds we have again as a point of reference the 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.310
 cars that on the top 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.219
 to the two 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.999
 last objects 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.999
 precisely from this place where I am located 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.850
 that the Querétaro telecable reporters managed to capture this 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.250
 flotilla of more than 80 unidentified flying objects from the past October 9 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.180
 the complete investigation you already knew her and this place is precisely 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.710
 where it was seen 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.020
 fantastic sighting my name will touch days vargas and this third 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.479
 millennium
