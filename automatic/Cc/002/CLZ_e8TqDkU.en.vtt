but again small speakers typically don't

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.200 
but again small speakers typically don't
have<00:01:12.020> deep<00:01:12.229> bass<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.820> sound<00:01:14.479> is<00:01:14.660> the

have deep bass and the sound is the
sound<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.390> primarily<00:01:17.810> focused<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
sound is primarily focused in the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.070 
sound is primarily focused in the
mid-range<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.910> a<00:01:20.000> slightly<00:01:20.330> muffled<00:01:20.869> but

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
mid-range it's a slightly muffled but

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.140 
mid-range it's a slightly muffled but
not<00:01:21.229> too<00:01:21.470> bad<00:01:21.680> now<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.190> speaker<00:01:22.640> is<00:01:22.850> a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
not too bad now the speaker is a

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.770 
not too bad now the speaker is a
speakerphone<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:24.410> it's<00:01:24.940> kind<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.060> depends<00:01:26.630> on

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
speakerphone so it's kind of depends on

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.090 
speakerphone so it's kind of depends on
