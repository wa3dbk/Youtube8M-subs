00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.259

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.600
 you do not want the topic then because too 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:22.060
 put 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.240
 on 10 november 2014 google has on one 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.500
 page announced that they 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.310
 serious security gaps in 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.640
 windows 8.1 have found where 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.500
 unauthorized user right 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.289
 you can actually get them 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:45.879
 not allowed to have and what has windows 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:48.340
 subsequently made and on 16 january 2015 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.260
 windows then responded and 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.059
 written 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.980
 We do not care about that 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.920
 no security patch 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.960
 provide 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.350
 unbelievably incredible why 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.769
 linux better i'm sorry that short 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.570
 in front 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.040
 then I 'll show you the page on that 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.040
 whole was published 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.940
 so I'm back on the side 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.340
 code.google.com and so on 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.670
 I'll buy you the url below 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 the video has google on the 10th 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.229
 already announced in november 2014 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.290
 that windows 8.1 is a serious one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.810
 security problem has not in that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.410
 gain unauthorized user right 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.550
 can 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:52.410
 This is not a small walk 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:55.020
 on january 16, 2015 , microsoft wrote 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.440
 We do not care about that back anymore 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.050
 or less we will not do that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.610
 provide security patch that is 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.710
 the problem of the end user still works 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.220
 why linux peres is easy 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.959
 once under linux even the smallest 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.480
 security breach becomes known word 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.209
 promptly within a few hours 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.100
 patch provided with it all linux 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.940
 keep your system up to date 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.130
 can bring 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.050
 microsoft shows that interests us 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 We do not do the work 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.060
 Do not choose the whole thing is too English 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.350
 I still have a German speaking 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.540
 page of www.telekom.de on the the 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.580
 whole bit is written to German 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.709
 then you can read that there and 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.250
 I presided over the bottom left below the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.260
 video and it has me really huge 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.299
 Look forward if you below and the comments 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.160
 still would write if you the whole 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.720
 also a mess finds from microsoft 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.670
 or maybe you think that's good 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.549
 or whatever really lures me 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.200
 then you are interested in what you think about it 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.100
 there is to look and to see 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.810
 next time 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.810
 why linux is better
