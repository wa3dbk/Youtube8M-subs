00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 so with a warm welcome to one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.589
 more tutorial and it should be today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.800
 that's why the buses go off 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.320
 the three generations add on too 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
 other cards can drive or how you can 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.970
 the goals display on other cards 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.410
 media doubt many puzzles and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.990
 That's why I'm just doing tutorial 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
 about how to line up here and there 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.510
 route so that everything fits 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.949
 better a brief incident with just rise 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.539
 the g n 1 to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.860
 For this we first have the electrics 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.149
 Turn only once here shows 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 then this shifts in the profession and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.250
 one yourself and if it can be here 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.950
 quite normal with line course and route 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 want to portray so that he almost a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.760
 route with the various stops 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 get displayed and the right one 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.360
 goal display above all would have to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 Go away for a bus-line course 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.860
 usually asked circus number if 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.449
 Hamburg , for example, would be the short number 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.370
 Entering the timetable is noted 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.190
 however, that does not have that here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.530
 animals have to almost completely Classic 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.439
 enter what also enter in our ibis 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.740
 that is, if it were just like the 92nd 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.909
 92 route 1 want to go then we go 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.560
 here 0 92 for line but without 00 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.080
 at the back but we write 01 now 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.200
 Threatened 1 it means the first three here 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.990
 for the line and the back two if 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.290
 in the case then for the route that is 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 yes with 92 route 1 give on trigger and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.159
 we already see first stop would be 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.869
 full street of golden beetle or warp 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.689
 display everything must have worked 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.150
 exactly heerstraße Stadtgrenze stands 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.090
 So everything works fine 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.979
 So change to the gen2 but can 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.130
 this middle model rows, too, yes 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.229
 everything here is electric at all 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.890
 not as complicated as it seems because 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.350
 Let's say bodo poke once 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.369
 confirm and here exactly the same under 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.649
 course simply give up 0 92 01 impressions 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.619
 ok and already have quasi first 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.129
 stop span freud street and we 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.660
 drive to heerstraße city border so the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.810
 question is how do we do this here now 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.209
 in the good c2 switch to it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.709
 here is all the help old spirit 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.380
 a bit more complicated that means 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.880
 always the electrics on need 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.880
 White is modern bus a little longer 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.269
 What is there to bring tor we do not care 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.269
 what is it s cash system is not on 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:45.239
 Such demonstration effect hardly has nothing 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:49.739
 prepare for effect hi earth 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.569
 We should check in again 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.549
 beautiful works also me 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.440
 probably the bus was broken before 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.870
 soft little bit of heaven is so 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.200
 here people were very classic with 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:11.330
 our staff and something a connoisseur yes 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:13.170
 all at once the 206 6 7 3 1 6 and 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.970
 usually now should still think 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.040
 we always have it in front of us to run 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.109
 we could theoretically have too 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.940
 just give 0 2 0 1 1 says though 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.420
 He then gives us a timetable 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.030
 active that means the c2 can only route 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.769
 read out or use routes if we 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.350
 We also have a timetable active 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.000
 without wanting to drive with their timetable 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.100
 Let's just do it and describe it 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.260
 manually you can virtually no routes 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.540
 but that is not possible right now 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.920
 different but I think it's just that way 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.930
 thought that means we go here once 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.760
 this part could change with line 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.540
 that we then entered 92 here 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.989
 We have to go out first 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.530
 looking for what highway city boundary is 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:01.850
 heerstraße city boundary 81 0 81 entabe 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.380
 and then we have here, too 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.569
 Heerstraße Stadtgrenze described so 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.010
 of the motorhome actually from me 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.609
 It was only a question for the 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.730
 spectator 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.170
 I find you too complicated but yes 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.269
 it was asked and thought so 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.280
 a tutorial is also like this with it 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.760
 the three generations bus at all 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.470
 possible apps can drive exactly at 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.590
 to go in 2 works relatively 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.310
 simultaneously with t2 in the ideal case with 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.690
 timetable 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.389
 And father is also like it 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.190
 just showed and I just say something 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.690
 for more ideas for tutorials today 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.669
 no below in the comments 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.120
 that was a lot to watch by 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.120
 next time and is a jeans
