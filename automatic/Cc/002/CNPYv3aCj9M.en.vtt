 its gameplay is classic with respect to the other races 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.940
 since you can build anywhere on the ground 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.299
 they must build buildings to maintain

 the rise of this type of repair buildings and mechanical units 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.190
 pieces 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.680

 guided by a leading creature known as the supermind 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:23.579

 only in the bullseye his trips 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.669
 but it extends 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.069
 and the units are generated from available larvae 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.449
 only in the plastic exercise 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:41.079

 in usa is the scenario 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.699
 the battlefield 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.059
 the player with 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.889
 where they should nurture the collection of resources 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.909
 and the construction of structures and units to form his army with the 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.689
 to attack on his opponent 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.409
 before you will have to discover where on the map your opponent is 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.040
 one using 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.379
 third place 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.399
 throughout the game should expand be here 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.739
 some passes in the fields of the river 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.429
 there are scattered on the map 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.769
 and you must do it quickly so as not to run out of resources in it 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.619
 they know the map well and monitor them during the course of the game is 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.619
 one of the keys to success 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:36.999
 the opening 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.789
 the opening was exit 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:39.919
 it is perhaps the moment 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.859
 the most important thing in a game of starcraft 2 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.329
 the strategy of each player for a certain game was defined that this 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 instant when you decide on a construction order 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.919
 structure to build first and in what order 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.450
 a jury decides its opening based on the race of its opponent 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.849
 within the official strategy of the state 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.849
 and it is so important to try to discover 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.509
 before his opponent how to prevent him from discovering the escape 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.889
 a good player of starcraft 2 has to be attentive simultaneously to the 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.449
 macro management and admitted that yes 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.819
 the macro management the saddest is the control of 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.870
 during the game 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.870
 along with the creation of units and destruction 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.449
 they are without light and the correct administration of resources 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.039
 micromanagement 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.010
 this control of the units and their abilities 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.250
 especially during battles in order to maximize the efficiency of the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.349
 army 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.349
 and to finish we can not forget 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.139
 and the science in the actions per minute 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.969
 a player during the game 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.349
 Players 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.400
 of the four tapes which means they make six here 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.190
 while developing your strategy and responding to your opponent's attacks 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.240
 you imagine the mental activity and concentration they need
