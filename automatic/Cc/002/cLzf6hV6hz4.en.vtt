00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
look at everything everything is

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.940 
look at everything everything is
triggered<00:01:34.020> by<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.110> moon<00:01:34.320> today<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.649> this<00:01:34.890> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
triggered by the moon today so this is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.650 
triggered by the moon today so this is
an<00:01:35.130> emotional<00:01:35.670> day<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> an

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
an emotional day and this is an

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.359 
an emotional day and this is an
emotional<00:01:37.110> day<00:01:37.229> dealing<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.770> our<00:01:37.979> happiness

emotional day dealing with our happiness

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.950 
emotional day dealing with our happiness
and<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.000> think<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.420> important<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> pay

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and I think it's so important to pay

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.030 
and I think it's so important to pay
attention<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.409> our<00:01:40.530> emotions<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:40.979> now

attention to our emotions right now

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
attention to our emotions right now

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.340 
really looking how we can create the
true<00:02:20.970> identity<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.540> who<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:21.989> want<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> be

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
true identity of who we want to be

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.500 
true identity of who we want to be
inside<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.310> easy<00:02:23.549> we<00:02:24.090> SAT<00:02:24.299> it<00:02:24.420> in

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
inside and it's not easy we SAT it in

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.390 
inside and it's not easy we SAT it in
Scorpio<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.530> easy<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.950> dedicate<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
Scorpio it's not easy to dedicate a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.530 
Scorpio it's not easy to dedicate a
hundred<00:02:26.670> percent<00:02:26.760> if<00:02:27.120> there's<00:02:27.330> something

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
hundred percent if there's something

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.030 
hundred percent if there's something
that<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.930> emotions<00:02:28.290> aren't<00:02:28.440> feeling<00:02:28.680> it's

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
not easy you know we could put throw a

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.840 
not easy you know we could put throw a
wall<00:02:31.320> up<00:02:31.500> or<00:02:31.680> something<00:02:31.980> remember<00:02:32.340> Saturn<00:02:32.730> is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.550

are some frustration

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.290 
are some frustration
that<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.130> could<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:49.400> frustrated<00:02:49.910> about<00:02:49.970> today
