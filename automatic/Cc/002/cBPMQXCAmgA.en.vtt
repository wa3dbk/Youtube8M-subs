00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
for the past five years I've been

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.170 
for the past five years I've been
investigating<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.370> question<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.910> where

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
investigating this question of where

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.870 
investigating this question of where
good<00:00:06.600> ideas<00:00:06.629> come<00:00:07.319> from<00:00:07.519> it's<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.610> kind<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
good ideas come from it's a kind of

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.190 
good ideas come from it's a kind of
problem<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.300> think<00:00:09.540> all<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.750> us<00:00:10.019> are

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
problem I think all of us are

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.350 
problem I think all of us are
intrinsically<00:00:10.800> interested<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:12.059> want<00:00:12.300> to

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
be more creative we want to come up with

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.580 
be more creative we want to come up with
better<00:00:14.340> ideas<00:00:14.509> we<00:00:15.509> want<00:00:15.719> our<00:00:15.780> organizations

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
better ideas we want our organizations

to be more innovative I've looked at

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.450 
to be more innovative I've looked at
this<00:00:18.960> problem<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.529> an<00:00:20.160> environmental

this problem from an environmental

perspective what are the spaces that
have<00:00:23.699> historically<00:00:23.910> led<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.779> unusual<00:00:25.230> rates

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
have historically led to unusual rates

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.130 
have historically led to unusual rates
of<00:00:25.650> creativity<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.430> innovation<00:00:27.109> when<00:00:28.109> I

of creativity and innovation when I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.740 
of creativity and innovation when I
found<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.369> these<00:00:29.609> systems<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.630> are

found in all these systems there are

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.479 
found in all these systems there are
these<00:00:30.840> recurring<00:00:31.439> patterns<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.340> see

dormant in the background it isn't until
the<00:00:54.239> idea<00:00:54.600> has<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.020> two<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.350> three<00:00:55.530> years

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sometimes 10 or 20 years to mature that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
sometimes 10 or 20 years to mature that
it<00:00:58.680> suddenly<00:00:58.890> become<00:00:59.309> successful<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it suddenly become successful to you and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
it suddenly become successful to you and
useful<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.559> certain<00:01:01.739> way<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.300> this

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
useful to you in a certain way and this

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
useful to you in a certain way and this
is<00:01:03.510> partially<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:05.220> ideas<00:01:05.580> normally

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is partially because good ideas normally

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
is partially because good ideas normally
come<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> collision<00:01:07.020> between<00:01:07.380> smaller

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
come from the collision between smaller

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
come from the collision between smaller
hunches<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.479> form<00:01:09.540> something

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
hunches so that they form something

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
hunches so that they form something
bigger<00:01:10.320> than<00:01:10.409> themselves<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> lot

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
bigger than themselves so you see a lot

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
bigger than themselves so you see a lot
in<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> history<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> innovation<00:01:13.520> cases<00:01:14.520> of

scrapped that after a couple years and
he<00:01:35.790> started<00:01:36.060> working<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.390> another<00:01:36.720> thing<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
he started working on another thing and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
he started working on another thing and
only<00:01:37.740> after<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.220> 10<00:01:38.490> years<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> full

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that's important when you think about

that's important when you think about

such engines of creativity because they

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.110 
such engines of creativity because they

new that really has I think been more

new that really has I think been more
than<00:03:17.170> anything<00:03:17.380> else<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.400> primary<00:03:18.730> engine<00:03:19.210> of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
than anything else the primary engine of

than anything else the primary engine of
creativity<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:19.990> innovation<00:03:20.440> over<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:20.890> last

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
600 or 700 years and so yes it's true

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.790 
600 or 700 years and so yes it's true
we're<00:03:25.090> more<00:03:25.270> distracted<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:26.560> what<00:03:26.710> has

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
we're more distracted but what has

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.950 
we're more distracted but what has
happened<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.850> really<00:03:28.030> miraculous<00:03:28.630> and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
happened that is really miraculous and

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
marvelous over the last 15 years is that

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.570 
marvelous over the last 15 years is that
we<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.110> many<00:03:32.320> new<00:03:32.560> ways<00:03:32.740> to<00:03:33.010> connect<00:03:33.370> and
