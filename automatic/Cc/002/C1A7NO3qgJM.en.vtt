my<00:00:47.630> extent<00:00:48.160> now<00:00:49.160> what<00:00:49.400> makes<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:49.760> cheap<00:00:50.060> is

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
my extent now what makes it cheap is

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.940 
my extent now what makes it cheap is
that<00:00:50.860> it<00:00:51.860> basically<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.450> I<00:00:54.140> mean<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.590> quality

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
that it basically the I mean the quality

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.040 
that it basically the I mean the quality
is<00:00:55.040> good<00:00:55.310> but<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:55.670> mean<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.120> springs<00:00:56.570> on<00:00:56.840> it

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
is good but I mean the springs on it

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.280 
is good but I mean the springs on it
aren't<00:00:57.650> very<00:00:57.890> good<00:00:58.010> aren't<00:00:58.490> very<00:00:58.850> strong<00:00:59.300> so

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
aren't very good aren't very strong so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.720 
aren't very good aren't very strong so
you'll<00:01:00.500> notice<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:00.950> if<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.190> put<00:01:01.430> for

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
you'll notice that if you put for

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.700 
you'll notice that if you put for
example<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:02.300> mic<00:01:02.840> that<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:03.260> that's<00:01:03.410> on<00:01:03.620> the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
example this mic that that that's on the

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.280 
example this mic that that that's on the
picture<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:04.640> is<00:01:04.759> a<00:01:04.790> co3<00:01:05.180> condenser<00:01:06.020> mic

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
picture that this is a co3 condenser mic

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.399 
picture that this is a co3 condenser mic
it's<00:01:07.040> heavy<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:07.790> if<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.150> put<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.720> down<00:01:08.990> a

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
it's heavy so if you put it down a

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.859 
it's heavy so if you put it down a
little<00:01:10.159> bit<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.670> max<00:01:10.880> 10<00:01:11.090> did<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.509> just<00:01:11.720> bring

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
little bit the max 10 did you just bring

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.200 
little bit the max 10 did you just bring
it<00:01:12.020> down<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:13.159> springs<00:01:13.460> aren't<00:01:13.670> strong<00:01:13.970> enough

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
it down the springs aren't strong enough

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.080 
it down the springs aren't strong enough
to<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.840> hold<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.770> mic<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.340> it'll<00:01:16.579> it'll<00:01:16.820> keep

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
to to hold the mic so it'll it'll keep

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.760 
to to hold the mic so it'll it'll keep
going<00:01:17.299> down<00:01:17.600> down<00:01:17.900> down<00:01:18.140> down<00:01:18.170> until<00:01:18.650> it's

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
going down down down down until it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.950 
going down down down down until it's
just<00:01:18.920> all<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.580> way<00:01:19.610> in<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.790> floor<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.270> it's

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
just all the way in the floor so it's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.040 
just all the way in the floor so it's
really<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.350> because<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.010> however<00:01:22.370> I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050

really that because of that however I
bought<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.290> because<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:25.310> was<00:01:25.460> really<00:01:25.700> cheap<00:01:25.970> so

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.180 
I said let me let me see what I can you
know<00:01:28.940> what<00:01:29.240> can<00:01:29.360> do<00:01:29.480> with<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.990> like<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.979> fact

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
know what can do with it I like the fact

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.820 
know what can do with it I like the fact
that<00:01:31.310> these<00:01:31.550> Max<00:01:31.820> 10<00:01:32.120> if<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.270> can<00:01:32.510> see<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.870> you

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
that these Max 10 if you can see it you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.980 
that these Max 10 if you can see it you
can<00:01:33.979> only<00:01:34.190> see<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:35.150> cable<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.750> comes

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
can only see the the cable that comes

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.649 
can only see the the cable that comes
out<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.630> end<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.680> mic<00:01:39.860> stand

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
out of the of the end of the mic stand

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.500 
out of the of the end of the mic stand
so<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.930> cable<00:01:42.229> goes<00:01:42.380> all<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.710> way<00:01:42.860> through<00:01:43.510> in

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
so the cable goes all the way through in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.120 
so the cable goes all the way through in
the<00:01:45.260> middle<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.659> of<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.200> bracket<00:01:48.890> there

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the middle of the of the bracket there

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.130 
the middle of the of the bracket there
the<00:01:49.520> metal<00:01:49.820> bracket<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.360> goes<00:01:50.540> inside<00:01:50.930> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
the metal bracket it goes inside the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.530 
the metal bracket it goes inside the
bracket<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.650> then<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.250> goes<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.360> only

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
bracket and then it goes and the only

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.170 
bracket and then it goes and the only
comes<00:01:54.020> out<00:01:54.229> from<00:01:54.710> both<00:01:54.890> ends<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:55.490> that's

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
comes out from both ends so that's

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.520 
comes out from both ends so that's
pretty<00:01:56.360> cool<00:01:56.600> that's<00:01:56.780> pretty<00:01:56.900> neat<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.350> keeps

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
pretty cool that's pretty neat it keeps

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.899 
pretty cool that's pretty neat it keeps
your<00:01:57.650> cables<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:58.220> know<00:01:58.340> cable<00:01:58.729> management

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
your cables you know cable management

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.990 
your cables you know cable management
basically<00:01:59.630> pretty<00:01:59.869> neat<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.670> let<00:02:01.820> me<00:02:01.880> go<00:02:01.970> back

front<00:06:46.939> or<00:06:47.030> back<00:06:47.560> just<00:06:48.560> because<00:06:48.800> the<00:06:49.189> condenser

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
front or back just because the condenser

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.640 
front or back just because the condenser
unit<00:06:49.729> is<00:06:50.029> like<00:06:50.150> that<00:06:50.599> position<00:06:51.050> however<00:06:51.409> has

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650

the capability of recording all around

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.019 
the capability of recording all around
too<00:06:53.719> so<00:06:54.050> that's<00:06:54.349> pretty<00:06:54.560> cool<00:06:54.800> since<00:06:55.759> I<00:06:55.819> use

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
too so that's pretty cool since I use

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:57.879 
too so that's pretty cool since I use
that<00:06:56.240> setting<00:06:56.479> depending<00:06:57.229> on<00:06:57.590> the<00:06:57.710> room

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
that setting depending on the room

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.189 
that setting depending on the room
depending<00:06:58.099> on<00:06:58.279> the<00:06:58.370> situation<00:06:58.939> to<00:06:59.240> record<00:07:00.080> my

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 
depending on the situation to record my

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.769 
depending on the situation to record my
acoustic<00:07:00.590> guitar<00:07:00.770> sometimes<00:07:01.639> it<00:07:01.759> just<00:07:01.909> grabs

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779 
acoustic guitar sometimes it just grabs

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:06.089 
acoustic guitar sometimes it just grabs
more<00:07:03.110> of<00:07:03.259> that<00:07:03.439> not<00:07:04.370> cutest<00:07:04.789> acoustic<00:07:05.599> sound
