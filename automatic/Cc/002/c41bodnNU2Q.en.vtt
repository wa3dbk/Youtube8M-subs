00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello girls and welcome back to my channel 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.679
 so today I make this video because 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 I want to tell you about a product I have 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.750
 really heard a lot about talking on 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.390
 web is also on youtube 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 the product in question is a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.029
 collistar product for hair and it is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.340
 the magical co lifter nuance therefore 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.669
 this product you need to make the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.160
 their shatush at home and is a product that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.590
 found in all perfumeries by deeds 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.649
 cota beauty star soap and water 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 the price is around 3 12 and 15 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.110
 about euro 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 I bought it from the beauty star and I got it 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 paid it seems to me 12 and 90 so this is it 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 the package inside the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.149
 package find the tube of 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.730
 product and then the leaflet 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 let's call it that and then a couple of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.800
 gloves to apply the product therefore 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.909
 this is precisely a gel product 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.670
 which goes to lighten the hair to tighten 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.680
 which should be applied with clean hair and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.150
 dry 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.860
 now I will explain briefly how 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.360
 then apply it once applied 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 product the product must be left 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.770
 dry naturally and then once 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.330
 that it will be dry enough to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.759
 comb your hair and you don't have to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.710
 rinse them neither anything 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.689
 so there are other ways to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 the first to apply this product is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.470
 take a comb apply the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.509
 product in the comb and then go to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.380
 comb the hair to have an effect 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.909
 a little more natural scratch style a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.120
 other way to instead apply the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.250
 product is take maybe 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.280
 some strands of hair and go instead 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.910
 to precisely massage the product into 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.030
 lock to have a somewhat stylish effect 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.380
 match while it is the third third way to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.860
 apply the product that I have 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.350
 done I was more than to go to 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.090
 split the hair into two parts into 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.470
 this way is going to massage the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.450
 obviously produced with gloves in 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.380
 endowment in the length of mine 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.790
 hair 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.790
 so I was attracted to this 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.750
 product because I saw mainly 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.310
 in short, the video that convinced me 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.130
 we can buy it was the video 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.900
 that made pamela just make up for 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.430
 collistar her and her hair a little more 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.620
 dark of mine shows that only 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.300
 three applications manages to get a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.900
 shatush effect really very much 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.130
 nice and direct from i want to try dir 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.660
 the truth until last year a 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.600
 I didn't like the shatush effect now 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.460
 instead I changed tastes I like I wanted 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.250
 try it then my warmth of 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.100
 so this departure is a brown one 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.840
 dark brown house or better let's say e 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.520
 however in all the length we say 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.110
 from here to the ends my hair 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.270
 they were already clearer because I had some 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.790
 mesh do about a year ago but I wanted to 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.610
 just go and lighten up 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.140
 only the final part in a way 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.630
 slightly more evident 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.700
 in fact, even in the packaging they do 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.209
 just see the type of lightening 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.680
 that can be achieved 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.280
 I unlike the pannella videos 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.550
 giusy make up that in three in three times 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.670
 managed to get that effect ho 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.320
 had to apply the product well 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.660
 I would say 5 or 6 times 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.100
 indeed 7 perhaps even because the first one 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.030
 time I tried to buy this 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.120
 product 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.910
 as I didn't know that it performs a 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.530
 defect could could create by adding i 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.989
 my hair 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.940
 I preferred to try it really try 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.410
 that we are produced to make it the point 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.720
 like a comb to put product on 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.430
 comb and go to comb or leave 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.230
 dry and absolutely not seen 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.790
 nothing 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.400
 I've tried all the other times 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.500
 consecutive instead I picked up a beautiful one 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.420
 night of product and I was really going 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.090
 massaging with your hands by distributing 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.610
 well its product all the hair 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.160
 I had to do it so many times because 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.380
 sincerely me with the third time not 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.340
 you could see nothing, the result is 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.690
 really really very very gradual 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.480
 it has a very very gradual lightening 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.250
 what to say I haven't been so much 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.170
 satisfied that what we say 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.080
 I wanted to keep it was just an effect 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.280
 shatush a little beggar of the 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.820
 that is, packaging that you could see 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.070
 clearly that the part at the bottom was 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.840
 clearer and I can't say that 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.570
 the melia product is not to be titled to me 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.790
 lightened however he injured them in 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.980
 very very natural way I got 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.740
 of the lighter reflections of the sentences more 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.840
 golden most loved then I will also put also 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.760
 the photo is also tried to do it in 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.340
 some lock in front and with this one 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.990
 lock a little lighter and then yes 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.600
 milia, however, very brightly 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.680
 very gradual and above all I have 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.110
 used is not that I have not used 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.120
 Product has used more than half 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.590
 of the product because as you can see it's all 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.540
 this part is empty but I don't have 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.760
 got that nice shatush effect 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.590
 intense beautiful defined that I would be 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.100
 liked to keep and as promised 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.040
 let's just say it as it was written 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.990
 so in the packaging what to say if you 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.410
 you want an effect in my opinion a lot 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.790
 gradual very natural that it is not 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.220
 too intense too defined 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.950
 surely it is a product that is worth the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.660
 worth trying if you like me instead 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.550
 you were looking for a more intense effect 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.470
 nice decided this in short not 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.880
 not better clarified so much then you 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.830
 I repeat I didn't go using 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.290
 Also a the eighth time because I said 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.790
 if you're still lighter than that anyway 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.440
 they did not come called useless 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.230
 continues to go continuously from 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.970
 apply this product in short 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.560
 as far as written is concerned about substances 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.210
 that soften the hair and it 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.350
 they feed however is a chemical product 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.590
 so I said enough 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.180
 six times not miri lightens more 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.280
 I don't use it anymore so I repeat 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.170
 if you want a very natural effect with 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.890
 natural lightening reflexes 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.600
 golden copper is fine if not instead 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.310
 the effect they promise 4 I will show 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.350
 even in the packaging they failed 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.480
 to get it then I don't know you do me 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.460
 know with a comment if maybe you have 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.360
 tried this product I am curious 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.420
 to know if you did but did a lot 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.040
 effect if you liked it or not and me 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.910
 seems to have told you everything indeed 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.790
 another thing I tried anyway 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.590
 having long hair and at most healthy 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.820
 it's not a ruined spoiled hat yes 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.620
 there is some double point but with i 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.430
 long hair is normal if you have i 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.680
 hair already with a lot of fine colors 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.090
 very fragile and I do not recommend 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.180
 use it because in any case there are agents 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.800
 chemists inside is another thing too 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.470
 also say in the package if you have the 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.480
 dark brown or black dark hair 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.780
 this product is not for you then ed 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.980
 medium brown hair let's say down and 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.320
 he doesn't respect her so much as this 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.610
 mindy review has been helpful I have 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.500
 felt to do it because precisely a 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.360
 product that is being done a lot 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.610
 to speak precisely I wanted to tell you my la 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.590
 my experience and let me know 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.760
 like a comment you think I will 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.840
 greeting and we will see each other 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.840
 hello video
