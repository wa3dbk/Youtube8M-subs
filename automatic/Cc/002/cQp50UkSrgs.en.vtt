times a day now you can vary this a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.620 
times a day now you can vary this a
little<00:02:10.490> bit<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.170> add<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:13.370> other<00:02:13.790> variations

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
little bit and add to other variations

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.830 
little bit and add to other variations
of<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.050> exercise<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:17.000> start<00:02:17.330> with<00:02:17.450> your

of this exercise you can start with your
this<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.530> what<00:02:18.770> we<00:02:18.890> call<00:02:19.130> neutral<00:02:19.670> that's

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
this is what we call neutral that's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.930 
this is what we call neutral that's

complet what we call the gastro sonia's
complex<00:02:43.400> back<00:02:43.610> there<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.960> do<00:02:45.110> that

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
complex back there so you can do that

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.680 
complex back there so you can do that
hold<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:46.070> forward<00:02:46.550> hold<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.240> count<00:02:47.600> of
