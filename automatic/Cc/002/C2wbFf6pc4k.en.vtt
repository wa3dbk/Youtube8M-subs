I've<00:00:57.890> always<00:00:58.130> been<00:00:58.399> awkward

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
I've always been awkward

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.780

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
so my paintings always have an awkward

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.649 
so my paintings always have an awkward
presence<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.050> that<00:01:03.110> awkward<00:01:03.590> presence<00:01:04.159> I<00:01:04.659> try

presence and that awkward presence I try

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.050 
presence and that awkward presence I try
to<00:01:05.719> exaggerate<00:01:06.439> I<00:01:06.619> try<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.950> make<00:01:07.190> it<00:01:07.340> split<00:01:07.880> off

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
to exaggerate I try to make it split off

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.200 
to exaggerate I try to make it split off
to<00:01:08.600> be<00:01:08.690> disjunctive<00:01:09.380> which<00:01:10.070> shows<00:01:10.370> here<00:01:10.760> okay

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
could draw it more smoothly than that

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.840 
could draw it more smoothly than that
look<00:01:17.900> at<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.020> way<00:01:18.110> he<00:01:18.229> occupies<00:01:18.619> his<00:01:18.799> face<00:01:19.070> you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
them but my production of monsters is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.410 
them but my production of monsters is
really<00:01:36.020> miniscule<00:01:37.060> compared<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.240> real
