while but now it's actually available in
the<00:04:14.200> android<00:04:14.320> market<00:04:14.560> it's<00:04:15.550> called<00:04:15.989> fpse

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
the android market it's called fpse

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.560 
the android market it's called fpse
which<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:17.800> a<00:04:17.830> PlayStation<00:04:18.460> 1<00:04:18.489> emulator<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.390> I

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
which is a PlayStation 1 emulator and I

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.720 
which is a PlayStation 1 emulator and I
must<00:04:19.750> say<00:04:19.960> it's<00:04:20.739> extremely<00:04:21.250> better<00:04:21.400> than<00:04:21.640> the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
must say it's extremely better than the

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.840 
must say it's extremely better than the
previous<00:04:22.180> one<00:04:22.450> which<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.930> think<00:04:23.140> was<00:04:23.290> a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
previous one which I think was a

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.700 
previous one which I think was a
psx4droid<00:04:24.850> or<00:04:25.450> something<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:25.900> but

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
psx4droid or something like that but

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.610 
psx4droid or something like that but
this<00:04:26.860> one's<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.430> hundred<00:04:28.270> times<00:04:28.390> better<00:04:28.720> right

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
this one's a hundred times better right

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.460 
this one's a hundred times better right
now<00:04:29.740> only<00:04:29.890> have<00:04:30.130> one<00:04:30.370> game<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:30.850> far<00:04:31.440> because<00:04:32.440> uh

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
now only have one game so far because uh

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.600 
now only have one game so far because uh
I<00:04:34.440> know<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.620> Walshes<00:04:35.950> like<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:36.220> but<00:04:36.370> this<00:04:36.490> is

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
I know the Walshes like that but this is
