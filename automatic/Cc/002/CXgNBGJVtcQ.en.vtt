00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.910 
that sit for about fifteen minutes
strain<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.350> homemade

better than Rose's lime juice so it's
not<00:02:08.970> too<00:02:09.149> difficult<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:09.780> don't<00:02:10.050> have

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
not too difficult and they don't have

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.449 
not too difficult and they don't have
the<00:02:10.229> sweetness<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.770> vary<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.310> mean<00:02:11.400> I'll

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the sweetness I vary it I mean I'll

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.590 
the sweetness I vary it I mean I'll
probably<00:02:11.610> do

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
probably do

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.130 
probably do
just<00:02:13.440> under<00:02:13.620> half<00:02:13.800> an<00:02:14.010> ounce<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.300> add<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
just under half an ounce and add that to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.510 
just under half an ounce and add that to
your<00:02:19.560> mixing<00:02:20.370> glass<00:02:22.070> now<00:02:23.070> those<00:02:23.220> are<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> only

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
your mixing glass now those are the only

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.190 
your mixing glass now those are the only
ingredients<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.450> we're<00:02:24.720> gonna<00:02:24.810> add<00:02:25.050> our<00:02:25.080> ice

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
ingredients so we're gonna add our ice

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:36.650 
ingredients so we're gonna add our ice
now<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:35.220> because<00:02:36.000> our<00:02:36.090> ingredients<00:02:36.570> are

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
now and because our ingredients are

00:02:36.660 --> 00:03:08.990 
now and because our ingredients are
clear<00:02:37.320> we're<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.950> stir<00:02:38.400> this<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.850> I

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
clear we're going to stir this and I

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.460 
clear we're going to stir this and I
stir<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.240> little<00:03:09.630> bit<00:03:09.750> longer<00:03:09.960> than<00:03:10.230> I

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
stir a little bit longer than I

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.110 
stir a little bit longer than I
sometimes<00:03:10.800> do<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> cocktail<00:03:11.700> just<00:03:11.790> because<00:03:12.030> I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
sometimes do the cocktail just because I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.570 
sometimes do the cocktail just because I
think<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.900> little<00:03:13.380> bit<00:03:13.560> extra<00:03:13.860> dilution<00:03:14.400> from

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
think a little bit extra dilution from

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.630 
think a little bit extra dilution from
the<00:03:14.670> ice<00:03:15.230> kind<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.290> tames<00:03:16.530> tames<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.520> gin<00:03:19.640> once

a<00:03:55.790> part<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:58.190> it's<00:03:58.310> not<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.580> most<00:03:58.730> you

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
a part of it so it's not the most you

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.430 
a part of it so it's not the most you
know<00:03:58.880> it's<00:03:59.060> not<00:03:59.180> complex<00:03:59.540> but<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.930> do<00:03:59.990> like<00:04:00.290> the
