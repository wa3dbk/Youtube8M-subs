00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.649 
sucks all barriers and break once they
go<00:05:30.159> through<00:05:30.190> their<00:05:30.340> whole<00:05:30.430> combo<00:05:30.909> it's<00:05:31.479> just

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
go through their whole combo it's just

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:32.999 
go through their whole combo it's just
off<00:05:31.780> barrier<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.289> break<00:05:32.469> and<00:05:32.680> then<00:05:32.860> you're

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
off barrier and break and then you're

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.379 
off barrier and break and then you're
able<00:05:33.099> to<00:05:33.340> freely<00:05:33.819> because<00:05:34.000> all<00:05:34.180> they<00:05:34.270> have

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
able to freely because all they have

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.600 
able to freely because all they have
after<00:05:34.659> that<00:05:34.780> is<00:05:34.870> like<00:05:35.020> an<00:05:35.199> 1800<00:05:36.129> attack<00:05:36.190> point

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
after that is like an 1800 attack point

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
see okay I don't know if that's what you

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.249 
see okay I don't know if that's what you
switched<00:06:14.939> before<00:06:15.180> but<00:06:15.300> most<00:06:15.479> people<00:06:15.719> did<00:06:15.900> it<00:06:16.050> I

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
switched before but most people did it I

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.390 
switched before but most people did it I
switched<00:06:16.740> it<00:06:16.860> for<00:06:16.979> that<00:06:17.069> because<00:06:17.189> I<00:06:17.340> figured

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
switched it for that because I figured

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.700 
switched it for that because I figured
he<00:06:17.879> beat<00:06:18.030> it<00:06:18.090> was<00:06:18.210> like<00:06:18.539> really<00:06:19.169> strong<00:06:19.469> when<00:06:19.650> I

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
he beat it was like really strong when I

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.709 
he beat it was like really strong when I
tested<00:06:19.889> it<00:06:20.159> was<00:06:20.310> like<00:06:20.550> key<00:06:20.759> beetle<00:06:21.090> emptiness

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
tested it was like key beetle emptiness

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.020 
tested it was like key beetle emptiness
key<00:06:21.990> beetle<00:06:22.259> safe<00:06:22.439> zone<00:06:22.680> and<00:06:22.949> then<00:06:23.099> every<00:06:23.819> time

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
key beetle safe zone and then every time

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.499 
key beetle safe zone and then every time
when<00:06:24.270> I<00:06:24.300> played<00:06:24.539> in<00:06:24.659> the<00:06:24.750> event<00:06:25.759> it<00:06:26.759> was<00:06:26.940> I<00:06:27.210> had
