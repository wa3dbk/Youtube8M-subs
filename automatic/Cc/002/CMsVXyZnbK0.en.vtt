00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to learn it in together time we're just

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.580 
to learn it in together time we're just
going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.200> learn<00:00:28.290> the<00:00:28.439> regular<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.090> now

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
going to learn the regular one now

going to learn the regular one now
remember<00:00:31.879> when<00:00:32.879> we<00:00:33.030> were<00:00:33.090> practicing<00:00:33.480> this

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
remember when we were practicing this

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.189 
remember when we were practicing this
your<00:00:35.309> together<00:00:35.760> time<00:00:36.470> circles<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.930> where

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
your together time circles this is where

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.680 
your together time circles this is where
learning<00:00:40.949> biz<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.970> to<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.270> start

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
learning biz is going to really start

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.070 
learning biz is going to really start
coming<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.199> handy<00:00:44.750> what<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:45.900> going<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
learn now is it remember your crossers

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.660 
learn now is it remember your crossers
or<00:00:50.370> your<00:00:50.489> crossover<00:00:51.060> sorry<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.520> what

or your crossover sorry this is what
you're<00:00:53.790> going<00:00:53.880> to<00:00:53.970> learn<00:00:54.030> next<00:00:56.149> you're

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you're going to learn next you're

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
you're going to learn next you're
crossers<00:00:57.630> before<00:00:58.110> what<00:00:58.559> we're<00:00:58.710> doing<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
crossers before what we're doing is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650 
crossers before what we're doing is
we're<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> combine<00:00:59.579> two<00:01:00.090> crossers

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
we're going to combine two crossers

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.150 
we're going to combine two crossers
together<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.530> arms<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
together and your arms are going to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.440 
together and your arms are going to
intersect<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.910> cross<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> good<00:01:05.790> thing<00:01:06.000> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
intersect and cross so a good thing to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.660 
intersect and cross so a good thing to
practice<00:01:06.619> might<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.649> to<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.190> get<00:01:08.399> a<00:01:08.430> good

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
practice might be to just get a good

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.540 
practice might be to just get a good
feel<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.300> your<00:01:09.420> arms<00:01:09.979> get<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> good<00:01:11.280> deal

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
feel for your arms get a good deal

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.609 
feel for your arms get a good deal
because<00:01:12.509> they're<00:01:13.050> not<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.410> to<00:01:13.500> be

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because they're not going to be

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
because they're not going to be
perfectly<00:01:14.190> in<00:01:14.399> together<00:01:14.580> time<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
perfectly in together time one have to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.200 
perfectly in together time one have to
go<00:01:15.869> slightly<00:01:16.320> before<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.310> other<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:18.000> still

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
go slightly before the other it's still

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.760 
go slightly before the other it's still
together<00:01:18.420> time<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> they<00:01:19.650> don't

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
together time but so that they don't

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.370 
together time but so that they don't
miss<00:01:20.130> they<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.580> hit<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> you're

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
miss they don't hit and so that you're

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you're lucky but you're going to really

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.130 
you're lucky but you're going to really
have<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.920> start<00:01:47.570> developing<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> feel<00:01:48.900> for

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
have to just start developing a feel for

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.440 
have to just start developing a feel for
this<00:01:49.580> now<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.610> good<00:01:50.820> idea

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
this now a good idea

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.330 
this now a good idea
will<00:01:53.020> be<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> practice<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.219> they

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
will be a practice this that they

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.929 
will be a practice this that they
intersect<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.350> see<00:01:56.770> how<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.070> left<00:01:57.579> one<00:01:57.909> is

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
intersect and see how the left one is

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.410 
intersect and see how the left one is
going<00:01:58.270> down<00:01:58.600> going<00:01:59.439> down<00:01:59.590> first<00:02:00.000> try<00:02:01.000> getting

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
going down going down first try getting

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.020 
going down going down first try getting
it<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:01.659> where<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:03.219> have<00:02:03.369> one<00:02:03.610> go<00:02:03.820> down

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
it to where you can have one go down

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.600 
it to where you can have one go down
first<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:05.170> other<00:02:05.320> one<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:06.039> may<00:02:06.219> have<00:02:06.429> to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
first and the other one you may have to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.969 
first and the other one you may have to
practice<00:02:07.090> like<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:07.570> then<00:02:08.470> you're<00:02:08.709> not<00:02:08.860> going

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
practice like this then you're not going

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.300 
practice like this then you're not going
to<00:02:09.069> be<00:02:09.130> able<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.340> do<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.580> with<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:09.729> swing<00:02:11.310> just

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
to be able to do it with one swing just

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.860 
to be able to do it with one swing just
like<00:02:12.459> with<00:02:12.580> your<00:02:12.700> crosser<00:02:13.150> kind<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.540> get<00:02:13.660> one

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
like with your crosser kind of get one

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.750 
like with your crosser kind of get one
two<00:02:14.500> three<00:02:15.220> one<00:02:15.970> two<00:02:16.000> three<00:02:16.599> one<00:02:17.590> two<00:02:18.340> three

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
two three one two three one two three

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.120

and<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.290> really<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.590> going<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.950> help

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
and this is really just going to help

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.830 
and this is really just going to help
you<00:02:21.280> develop<00:02:21.519> control<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.390> both<00:02:22.540> these

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
you develop control for both these

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.710 
you develop control for both these
tricks<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.560> future<00:02:24.010> tricks<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.630> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
tricks and future tricks like one of the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.220 
tricks and future tricks like one of the
next<00:02:26.049> upcoming<00:02:26.319> lessons<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.340> butterfly

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
next upcoming lessons to the butterfly

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.380 
next upcoming lessons to the butterfly
kind<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.290> practice<00:02:29.650> these<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.880> get<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.209> where

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
kind of practice these and get to where

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.050 
kind of practice these and get to where
you<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.810> barely<00:02:32.230> intercept<00:02:32.950> them<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.310> get

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
you can barely intercept them and get

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.789 
you can barely intercept them and get
that<00:02:34.239> going<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.200> going<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.530> help

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
that going this is going to really help

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.970 
that going this is going to really help
you<00:02:35.980> out<00:02:36.130> with<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> lot<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.670> things<00:02:36.849> like<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.269> said

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you out with a lot of things like I said

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.850 
you out with a lot of things like I said
so<00:02:38.980> now<00:02:39.630> basically<00:02:40.630> there's<00:02:41.140> not<00:02:41.349> really<00:02:41.560> too

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
so now basically there's not really too

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.350 
so now basically there's not really too
many<00:02:42.010> more<00:02:42.220> steps<00:02:42.489> leading<00:02:42.880> up<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.239> this

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
many more steps leading up to this

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.550 
many more steps leading up to this
you're<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.019> have<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.200> kind<00:02:44.470> of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
you're just going to have to kind of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.740 
you're just going to have to kind of
cross<00:02:45.160> your<00:02:45.459> arms<00:02:45.730> over<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.269> just<00:02:46.390> combine

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
cross your arms over and just combine

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.430 
cross your arms over and just combine
your<00:02:46.989> two<00:02:47.019> crosses<00:02:47.769> crop<00:02:48.160> crossovers<00:02:49.440> it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
your two crosses crop crossovers it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.140 
your two crosses crop crossovers it
doesn't<00:02:50.799> matter<00:02:50.890> which<00:02:51.220> hand<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.790> learn

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
doesn't matter which hand you learn

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.990 
doesn't matter which hand you learn
going<00:02:52.840> first<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:54.010> I'll<00:02:54.099> recommend<00:02:54.519> learning

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
going first but I'll recommend learning

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.660 
going first but I'll recommend learning
both<00:02:55.390> actually<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.739> sure<00:02:56.950> learn<00:02:57.160> boat<00:02:57.430> and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
both actually for sure learn boat and

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.940 
both actually for sure learn boat and
don't<00:02:58.389> move<00:02:58.569> on<00:02:58.780> too<00:02:59.049> much<00:02:59.200> further<00:02:59.470> in<00:02:59.829> the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
don't move on too much further in the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.009 
don't move on too much further in the
lesson<00:03:00.370> until<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.359> really<00:03:01.630> get<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> good

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
lesson until you really get a good

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.870 
lesson until you really get a good
control<00:03:02.440> get<00:03:02.799> good<00:03:02.980> control<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:05.639> is<00:03:06.639> you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
control get good control is this is you

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.230 
control get good control is this is you
to<00:03:07.060> be<00:03:07.209> bleep<00:03:07.389> together<00:03:07.870> time

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
to be bleep together time

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.670 

get<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:10.990> get<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.680> down<00:03:11.940> okay<00:03:12.940> well<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.870> decided

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
get it get it down okay well I decided

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.650 
get it get it down okay well I decided
to<00:03:15.040> extend<00:03:15.250> lesson<00:03:15.730> for<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.360> include

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
to extend lesson for to include

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.390 
to extend lesson for to include
butterflies<00:03:17.140> because<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:18.010> was<00:03:18.130> really

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
butterflies because I was really

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.910 
butterflies because I was really
thinking<00:03:18.580> about<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.420> like<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.530> was<00:03:20.680> saying

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
thinking about it and like I was saying

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.340 
thinking about it and like I was saying
before<00:03:21.060> when<00:03:22.060> you're<00:03:22.210> learning<00:03:22.360> these<00:03:22.690> once

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
before when you're learning these once

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.530 
before when you're learning these once
you<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:23.800> town<00:03:24.100> there's<00:03:24.970> not<00:03:25.300> really

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
you get this town there's not really

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.080 
you get this town there's not really
much<00:03:25.780> more<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.950> do<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.340> get<00:03:27.460> your<00:03:27.610> butterflies

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
much more to do to get your butterflies

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.230 
much more to do to get your butterflies
once<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.990> get<00:03:29.170> up<00:03:29.830> once<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.670> get<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:30.880> all<00:03:31.210> of

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
once you get up once you get to all of

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.430 
once you get up once you get to all of
these<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.690> know<00:03:32.430> okay<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:35.260> your

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
these you know okay so this is your

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.150 
these you know okay so this is your
butterfly<00:03:36.630> here's<00:03:37.630> from<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:37.990> angle<00:03:38.170> now

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
butterfly here's from this angle now

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.740 
butterfly here's from this angle now
notice<00:03:39.370> how<00:03:39.580> they're<00:03:39.760> slightly<00:03:40.000> split<00:03:40.450> apart

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
notice how they're slightly split apart

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.560 
notice how they're slightly split apart
and<00:03:41.050> I'm<00:03:41.950> going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.220> recommend<00:03:42.460> learning<00:03:43.210> your

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
and I'm going to recommend learning your

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.410 
and I'm going to recommend learning your
butterflies<00:03:44.110> doing<00:03:44.920> them<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.460> and<00:03:45.760> it

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
butterflies doing them like this and it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.460 
butterflies doing them like this and it
will<00:03:46.450> be<00:03:46.660> easy<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.320> start<00:03:48.390> by<00:03:49.390> keeping<00:03:49.630> one<00:03:50.140> arm

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
will be easy to start by keeping one arm

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.980 
will be easy to start by keeping one arm
above<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.430> other<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.030> learning<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.750> cross

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
above the other and learning to cross

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.410 
above the other and learning to cross
them<00:03:53.260> like<00:03:53.440> this<00:03:53.650> notice<00:03:54.550> how<00:03:54.730> they're<00:03:55.000> split

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
them like this notice how they're split

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.710 
them like this notice how they're split
one<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:57.160> direction<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:58.000> one<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.540> this

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
one is this direction and one is this

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.840 
one is this direction and one is this
direction<00:03:59.110> as<00:03:59.470> you<00:04:00.010> get<00:04:00.160> better<00:04:00.340> at<00:04:00.520> them

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
direction as you get better at them

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.820 
direction as you get better at them
you'll<00:04:01.330> be<00:04:01.480> able<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.750> slowly<00:04:02.110> move<00:04:02.440> them<00:04:02.650> in

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
you'll be able to slowly move them in

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.280 
you'll be able to slowly move them in
and<00:04:03.040> get<00:04:03.550> them<00:04:03.610> almost<00:04:04.030> at<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.660> exact<00:04:05.080> same

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
and get them almost at the exact same

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.260 
and get them almost at the exact same
spot<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.920> you'll<00:04:06.520> be<00:04:06.640> able<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.880> get<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.060> real

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
spot and you'll be able to get it real

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.030 
spot and you'll be able to get it real
close<00:04:07.300> together<00:04:07.810> as<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.200> can<00:04:08.410> see<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.860> you'll

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
close together as you can see and you'll

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.940 
close together as you can see and you'll
still<00:04:09.280> hear<00:04:09.550> them<00:04:09.700> once<00:04:09.940> in<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.150> while<00:04:10.330> and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
still hear them once in a while and

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.200 
still hear them once in a while and
after<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.130> while<00:04:12.310> you'll<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:12.760> develop<00:04:13.120> a

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
after a while you'll just develop a

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.580 
after a while you'll just develop a
really<00:04:13.450> good<00:04:13.630> feel<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.110> you'll<00:04:14.230> be<00:04:14.380> able<00:04:14.440> to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
really good feel and you'll be able to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.310 
really good feel and you'll be able to
adjust<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.100> speed<00:04:15.370> just<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.390> but<00:04:17.170> try

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
adjust the speed just like that but try

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.720 
adjust the speed just like that but try
not<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.500> worry<00:04:17.710> about<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:18.040> speed<00:04:18.220> adjustments

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
not to worry about the speed adjustments

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.520 
not to worry about the speed adjustments
too<00:04:18.880> much<00:04:19.060> yet<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:20.049> try<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.320> get<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:22.690> but

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
too much yet just try to get that but

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.740 
too much yet just try to get that but
they<00:04:23.710> intersect<00:04:24.250> kind<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.670> like<00:04:24.820> an<00:04:24.970> atom

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
they intersect kind of like an atom

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.140 
they intersect kind of like an atom
Adam<00:04:26.380> shake<00:04:26.620> which<00:04:26.920> technically<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:28.120> is

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
Adam shake which technically that is

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.050 
Adam shake which technically that is
pretty<00:04:28.810> much<00:04:28.960> an<00:04:29.140> atomic<00:04:29.680> butterfly<00:04:30.340> which

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
pretty much an atomic butterfly which

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.300 
pretty much an atomic butterfly which
all<00:04:31.480> butterflies<00:04:31.810> or<00:04:32.320> atomic<00:04:32.500> in<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.800> sense<00:04:33.040> but

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
all butterflies or atomic in a sense but

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.930 
all butterflies or atomic in a sense but
here<00:04:34.270> right<00:04:34.540> here<00:04:34.890> it's<00:04:35.890> really<00:04:36.160> exaggerated

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
here right here it's really exaggerated

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.590 
here right here it's really exaggerated
so<00:04:37.780> just<00:04:37.990> get<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.260> down<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:39.240> I'd<00:04:40.240> recommend

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
so just get that down and I'd recommend

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.270 
so just get that down and I'd recommend
learning<00:04:41.490> folks<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.730> both<00:04:43.270> ways<00:04:43.510> and

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
learning folks it both ways and

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.770 
learning folks it both ways and
butterflies<00:04:45.280> are<00:04:45.700> fairly<00:04:45.970> difficult<00:04:46.330> when

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
butterflies are fairly difficult when

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.170 
butterflies are fairly difficult when
you<00:04:46.870> first<00:04:47.110> start<00:04:47.470> it's<00:04:48.190> actually<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.640> beginner

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
you first start it's actually a beginner

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.559 
you first start it's actually a beginner
move<00:04:49.360> but<00:04:49.720> they<00:04:50.530> are<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.740> little<00:04:50.950> hard

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
move but they are a little hard

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.540 
move but they are a little hard
and<00:04:52.689> just<00:04:53.469> practice<00:04:53.619> like<00:04:53.979> that<00:04:54.159> keep<00:04:54.399> your

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
and just practice like that keep your

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.820 
and just practice like that keep your
hands<00:04:54.729> apart<00:04:55.089> but<00:04:55.719> the<00:04:55.839> important<00:04:56.319> part<00:04:56.559> is

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
hands apart but the important part is

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.189 
hands apart but the important part is
that<00:04:56.919> you<00:04:57.249> keep<00:04:57.520> them<00:04:57.759> in<00:04:57.909> sync<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.869> trick<00:04:59.169> to

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
that you keep them in sync the trick to

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.649 
that you keep them in sync the trick to
the<00:04:59.409> butterflies<00:04:59.889> like<00:05:00.309> I<00:05:00.550> keep<00:05:00.909> stressing<00:05:01.149> is

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
the butterflies like I keep stressing is

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.239 
the butterflies like I keep stressing is
that<00:05:02.409> atonic<00:05:03.039> figure<00:05:04.319> at<00:05:05.319> atomic<00:05:05.679> city<00:05:06.009> right

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:06.249 
that atonic figure at atomic city right

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.879 
that atonic figure at atomic city right
there<00:05:06.459> don't<00:05:06.999> try<00:05:07.569> not<00:05:07.749> to<00:05:07.929> learn<00:05:08.169> your

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
there don't try not to learn your

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.199 
there don't try not to learn your
butterflies<00:05:09.399> like<00:05:10.330> this<00:05:10.599> it<00:05:10.809> for<00:05:11.020> at<00:05:12.029> try<00:05:13.029> not

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:13.209 
butterflies like this it for at try not

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:18.359 
butterflies like this it for at try not
to<00:05:13.360> learn<00:05:13.539> them<00:05:13.749> sideways<00:05:14.080> oh<00:05:15.119> my<00:05:16.119> god<00:05:17.219> try<00:05:18.219> not

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:18.369 
to learn them sideways oh my god try not

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.459 
to learn them sideways oh my god try not
to<00:05:18.429> do<00:05:18.669> that<00:05:18.819> which<00:05:19.569> I<00:05:19.749> stopped<00:05:19.990> trouble<00:05:20.349> with

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
to do that which I stopped trouble with

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.049 
to do that which I stopped trouble with
sometimes<00:05:20.860> when<00:05:21.159> I'm<00:05:21.279> actually<00:05:21.429> spinning<00:05:21.909> I

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:22.059 
sometimes when I'm actually spinning I

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:24.029 
sometimes when I'm actually spinning I
can<00:05:22.240> actually<00:05:22.509> do<00:05:22.599> it<00:05:22.689> just<00:05:22.869> fine<00:05:23.050> but<00:05:23.349> when

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
can actually do it just fine but when

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.820 
can actually do it just fine but when
I'm<00:05:24.129> teaching<00:05:24.309> on<00:05:24.669> trouble<00:05:24.969> with<00:05:25.059> it<00:05:25.499> so<00:05:26.499> try

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
I'm teaching on trouble with it so try

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.399 
I'm teaching on trouble with it so try
Oh<00:05:27.159> ignore<00:05:27.789> what<00:05:28.059> i<00:05:28.119> was<00:05:28.240> just<00:05:28.419> doing<00:05:28.719> ignore

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
Oh ignore what i was just doing ignore

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.689 
Oh ignore what i was just doing ignore
that<00:05:29.639> okay<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:32.169> practice<00:05:32.529> that<00:05:32.559> with<00:05:32.979> both

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
that okay so practice that with both

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.150 
that okay so practice that with both
hands<00:05:34.029> on<00:05:34.270> top

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.239 

stop<00:05:38.790> it

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:40.249 
stop it

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.559 
stop it
other<00:05:40.849> hand<00:05:41.119> on<00:05:41.269> top<00:05:41.409> stop<00:05:42.409> it<00:05:43.149> other<00:05:44.149> hand<00:05:44.449> on

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
other hand on top stop it other hand on

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.299 
other hand on top stop it other hand on
top<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:45.079> you're<00:05:45.289> going<00:05:45.379> to<00:05:45.439> slowly<00:05:45.619> be<00:05:46.009> able

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:46.309 
top and you're going to slowly be able

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.679 
top and you're going to slowly be able
to<00:05:46.369> get<00:05:46.519> it<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:46.669> where<00:05:46.909> you<00:05:47.119> can<00:05:47.299> connect<00:05:47.629> your

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:47.689 
to get it to where you can connect your

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:50.739 
to get it to where you can connect your
hands<00:05:48.169> and<00:05:48.859> you'll<00:05:49.039> be<00:05:49.129> able<00:05:49.189> to<00:05:49.309> do<00:05:49.429> that<00:05:49.749> as

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:50.749 
hands and you'll be able to do that as

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.529 
hands and you'll be able to do that as
you<00:05:50.869> get<00:05:50.989> 2<00:05:51.109> i'll<00:05:51.349> do<00:05:51.679> it<00:05:51.769> from<00:05:51.889> this<00:05:52.009> angle

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
you get 2 i'll do it from this angle

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:58.860 
you get 2 i'll do it from this angle
you've<00:05:53.539> got<00:05:53.719> those<00:05:54.849> that<00:05:56.199> stop<00:05:57.199> it

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
you've got those that stop it

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.790 
you've got those that stop it
and<00:05:59.410> there<00:05:59.590> you<00:05:59.710> go<00:06:00.090> before<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.180> know<00:06:01.330> it<00:06:01.800> you

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
and there you go before you know it you

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.930 
and there you go before you know it you
can<00:06:02.860> have<00:06:03.070> your<00:06:03.190> butterflies<00:06:03.580> and<00:06:03.850> you're

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
can have your butterflies and you're

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.050 
can have your butterflies and you're
going<00:06:04.060> to<00:06:04.120> love<00:06:04.270> them<00:06:04.800> butterflies<00:06:05.800> are<00:06:06.280> a<00:06:06.400> lot

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
going to love them butterflies are a lot

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.950 
going to love them butterflies are a lot
of<00:06:07.090> fun<00:06:07.390> I<00:06:09.120> loved<00:06:10.120> him<00:06:10.270> when<00:06:10.420> i<00:06:10.480> first<00:06:10.780> started

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
of fun I loved him when i first started

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.320 
of fun I loved him when i first started
and<00:06:11.380> actually<00:06:11.800> i<00:06:11.830> probably<00:06:12.130> spent<00:06:12.670> a<00:06:12.820> good<00:06:13.030> two

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
and actually i probably spent a good two

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.210 
and actually i probably spent a good two
weeks<00:06:13.660> on<00:06:14.050> my<00:06:14.260> butterflies<00:06:14.710> when<00:06:14.950> I<00:06:15.010> first

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
weeks on my butterflies when I first

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.800 
weeks on my butterflies when I first
started<00:06:15.640> I<00:06:15.760> was<00:06:15.790> a<00:06:15.940> very<00:06:16.180> slow<00:06:16.540> learner

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
started I was a very slow learner

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.200 
started I was a very slow learner
actually<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:18.190> took<00:06:18.400> me<00:06:18.520> a<00:06:18.550> long<00:06:18.760> time<00:06:18.820> to

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
actually it took me a long time to

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.680 
actually it took me a long time to
really<00:06:19.510> get<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.900> basics<00:06:20.800> down<00:06:21.040> and<00:06:21.400> i<00:06:21.690> really

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
really get the basics down and i really

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.940 
really get the basics down and i really
wish<00:06:22.840> i<00:06:22.990> would<00:06:23.110> have<00:06:23.140> had<00:06:23.260> good<00:06:23.530> guidance

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
wish i would have had good guidance

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.520 
wish i would have had good guidance
because<00:06:24.480> there's<00:06:25.480> a<00:06:25.600> lot<00:06:25.780> of<00:06:25.810> things<00:06:26.020> i<00:06:26.230> miss

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
because there's a lot of things i miss
