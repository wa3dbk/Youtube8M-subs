yeah Winco 3 wo 1:7 e7k unit 33 amps I'm
gonna<00:00:28.680> assume<00:00:28.980> that's<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.310> 240<00:00:29.939> volts<00:00:32.450> 3600

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
gonna assume that's at 240 volts 3600

rpm unit could have sworn this would
have<00:00:37.290> been<00:00:37.380> 1800<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> size<00:00:39.000> of

have been 1800 because of the size of
the<00:00:39.270> thing<00:00:40.550> but<00:00:42.739> it's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> 3600<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.050> it's<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the thing but it's a 3600 and it's the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.380 
the thing but it's a 3600 and it's the
only<00:00:46.289> disappointment<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.120> runs<00:00:48.329> like

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
only disappointment this thing runs like

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.529 
only disappointment this thing runs like
a<00:00:48.510> top<00:00:49.789> sounds<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.940> healthy<00:00:51.649> doesn't<00:00:52.649> smoke

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.670 

someone<00:00:57.539> painted<00:00:57.870> it<00:01:00.050> shouldn't<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.109> blue<00:01:01.320> on

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
someone painted it shouldn't be blue on

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.580 
someone painted it shouldn't be blue on

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
iron boar and the other thing that

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.980 
iron boar and the other thing that
surprised<00:01:25.090> me<00:01:25.270> but<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:25.630> no<00:01:25.750> big<00:01:25.960> deal

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
surprised me but it's no big deal

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.940 
surprised me but it's no big deal
because<00:01:26.409> I<00:01:26.560> can<00:01:26.710> change<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:28.950> there's

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
because I can change that is there's

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.930 
because I can change that is there's
nothing<00:01:30.190> here

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
nothing here

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.340 
nothing here
there<00:01:31.149> should<00:01:31.330> be<00:01:31.360> an<00:01:31.509> electric<00:01:31.899> starter<00:01:32.290> I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
there should be an electric starter I

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.180 
there should be an electric starter I
thought<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.830> twin<00:01:34.710> shoot<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:35.950> should<00:01:36.100> be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
thought a twin shoot that should be

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.070 
thought a twin shoot that should be
automatic<00:01:36.729> because<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.540> lot<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.899> pull

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
automatic because it is a lot to pull

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.240 
automatic because it is a lot to pull
over<00:01:38.290> but<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:41.560> how<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.770> was<00:01:41.860> built<00:01:42.040> and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
over but that's how it was built and

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.050 
over but that's how it was built and
there<00:01:42.369> is<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.490> block<00:01:42.729> off<00:01:42.970> plate<00:01:43.119> there<00:01:43.479> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
there is a block off plate there and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.219 
there is a block off plate there and
peeled<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.270> back<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:47.310> found<00:01:48.310> teeth<00:01:48.580> so

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
peeled that back and I found teeth so

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.080 
peeled that back and I found teeth so
like<00:01:50.229> an<00:01:50.350> electric<00:01:50.740> starter<00:01:51.070> set<00:01:51.729> up<00:01:51.820> on<00:01:51.970> this

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
like an electric starter set up on this

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.919 
like an electric starter set up on this
if<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.300> want<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.990> does<00:01:53.229> have<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.390> charging

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
if I want it does have the charging

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.660 
if I want it does have the charging
system<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.619> that's<00:01:56.710> actually<00:01:57.039> for<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.429> 12

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
system and that's actually for the 12

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.210 
system and that's actually for the 12
volt<00:01:57.909> hookup<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:59.050> guy<00:01:59.200> said<00:01:59.500> all<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.710> 12<00:01:59.950> volt

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
volt hookup the guy said all the 12 volt

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.279 
volt hookup the guy said all the 12 volt
doesn't<00:02:00.580> work<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.750> got<00:02:01.929> him<00:02:02.050> down<00:02:02.170> in

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
doesn't work on it and I got him down in

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.749 
doesn't work on it and I got him down in
price<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> little<00:02:02.860> bit<00:02:02.979> because<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.429> it<00:02:03.550> but

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
price a little bit because of it but

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.100 
price a little bit because of it but
right<00:02:03.909> away<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.179> knew<00:02:04.360> what<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.569> problem<00:02:04.929> was

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
right away I knew what the problem was

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.529 
right away I knew what the problem was
this<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.530> not<00:02:05.740> abduct<00:02:06.280> something<00:02:07.149> was<00:02:07.270> done

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
this is not abduct something was done

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.240 
this is not abduct something was done
and<00:02:07.810> probably<00:02:08.470> around<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.679> same<00:02:08.860> time<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.130> was

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and probably around the same time it was

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.889 
and probably around the same time it was
painted<00:02:09.580> either<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.970> engine<00:02:10.179> was<00:02:10.509> worked<00:02:10.720> on

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
painted either the engine was worked on

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.559 
painted either the engine was worked on
overhauled<00:02:11.500> short<00:02:11.890> blocked<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.940> they

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
overhauled short blocked and they

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.150 
overhauled short blocked and they
painted<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.080> make<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.410> look<00:02:14.560> nicer<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
painted it to make it look nicer and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.090 
painted it to make it look nicer and
kind<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.000> rehab<00:02:16.329> it<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:16.780> they<00:02:17.590> messed<00:02:17.829> up<00:02:18.010> a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
kind of rehab it but they messed up a

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.410 
kind of rehab it but they messed up a
lot<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.370> things<00:02:18.579> on<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.120> should<00:02:19.329> be

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
lot of things on this that should be

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.979 
lot of things on this that should be
working<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.989> they<00:02:20.079> don't<00:02:21.750> functionally<00:02:22.750> it

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
working and they don't functionally it

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.150 
working and they don't functionally it
works<00:02:23.440> but<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:25.600> lost<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.110> wiring<00:02:26.590> from<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.829> 12

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
works but we lost the wiring from the 12

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.390 
works but we lost the wiring from the 12
volts<00:02:27.579> to<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.630> panel

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
volts to the panel

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.190 
volts to the panel
we<00:02:30.400> lost<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.880> automatic<00:02:31.420> idle<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.930> brings

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
we lost the automatic idle that brings

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.630 
we lost the automatic idle that brings
down<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.560> speed<00:02:35.799> when<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.100> not<00:02:36.250> under<00:02:36.430> load

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
down to speed when it's not under load

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.780 
down to speed when it's not under load
and<00:02:37.380> you'll<00:02:38.380> see<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.650> wire<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.459> had<00:02:39.700> to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
and you'll see this wire here I had to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.630 
and you'll see this wire here I had to
do<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.480> put<00:02:40.780> some<00:02:40.989> tension<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
do that to put some tension on the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.090 
do that to put some tension on the
throttle<00:02:42.640> bracket<00:02:42.820> because<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:44.739> would<00:02:44.920> just

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
throttle bracket because it would just

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.920 
throttle bracket because it would just
run<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.370> idle<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.000> whoever<00:02:46.390> did<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.720> work

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
run it idle and whoever did the work

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.250 
run it idle and whoever did the work
just<00:02:47.320> use<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.620> throttle<00:02:47.829> stop<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.930> set<00:02:50.109> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
just use the throttle stop to set the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.430 
just use the throttle stop to set the
speed<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.489> was<00:02:52.180> running<00:02:52.329> pretty<00:02:52.510> fast<00:02:52.660> when<00:02:53.170> I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
speed and was running pretty fast when I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.380 
speed and was running pretty fast when I
when<00:02:53.859> I<00:02:53.890> got<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.579> guy's<00:02:54.760> house<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.239> buy

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
when I got to the guy's house to buy

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.970 
when I got to the guy's house to buy
then<00:02:55.630> he<00:02:55.720> demonstrated<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.470> knew<00:02:56.650> something

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
then he demonstrated I knew something

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.880 
then he demonstrated I knew something
was<00:02:57.070> up

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
was up

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.750 
was up
so<00:02:59.890> I<00:02:59.920> think<00:03:00.280> there<00:03:00.430> was<00:03:00.519> something

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
so I think there was something

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.460 
so I think there was something
electrical<00:03:01.359> that's<00:03:01.540> usually<00:03:01.810> what<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.019> is<00:03:02.140> for

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
electrical that's usually what it is for

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.710 
electrical that's usually what it is for
the<00:03:02.530> idle<00:03:02.799> control<00:03:03.329> electrical<00:03:04.329> or<00:03:04.600> is

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the idle control electrical or is

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.400 
the idle control electrical or is
something<00:03:04.989> with<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> throttle<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:07.030> it's

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
something with a throttle but it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.349 
something with a throttle but it's
missing<00:03:09.720> so

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
missing so

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.589 
missing so
there's<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.629> main<00:03:14.129> defects<00:03:15.129> of<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.489> but<00:03:15.700> it

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
there's the main defects of it but it

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.800 
there's the main defects of it but it
does<00:03:16.840> make<00:03:17.109> good<00:03:17.500> power<00:03:17.849> on<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:19.060> 120<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:19.599> the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
does make good power on the 120 and the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.809 
does make good power on the 120 and the
240<00:03:20.379> it's<00:03:20.530> got<00:03:20.650> all<00:03:20.769> kinds<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:21.280> hookups<00:03:21.670> on

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
240 it's got all kinds of hookups on

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.440 
240 it's got all kinds of hookups on
here<00:03:22.769> all<00:03:23.769> three<00:03:24.219> prong<00:03:24.489> twist<00:03:24.879> lock<00:03:25.120> for<00:03:25.359> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
here all three prong twist lock for the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.520 
here all three prong twist lock for the
120<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.079> 240<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.829> then<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> duplex<00:03:27.670> there<00:03:27.969> but

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
120 and 240 and then a duplex there but

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.080 
120 and 240 and then a duplex there but
this<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.590> pretty<00:03:29.950> beat<00:03:30.219> up<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.609> I'm<00:03:30.670> gonna<00:03:30.819> get

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
this is pretty beat up so I'm gonna get

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.789 
this is pretty beat up so I'm gonna get
it<00:03:31.209> I'm<00:03:31.389> gonna<00:03:31.599> put<00:03:31.719> another<00:03:32.049> duplex<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.709> then

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
it I'm gonna put another duplex and then

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.479 
it I'm gonna put another duplex and then
replace<00:03:33.159> that<00:03:34.650> there's<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.859> battery

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
replace that there's the battery

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.509 
replace that there's the battery
connector<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.299> do<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:38.099> cable<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.219> belongs

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
connector I do have a cable that belongs

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.080 
connector I do have a cable that belongs
to<00:03:39.639> it

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
to it

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.909 
to it
what's<00:03:40.329> for<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.599> connector<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:43.450> charging

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
what's for that connector for charging

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:50.819 
what's for that connector for charging
batteries<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.750> was<00:03:46.930> 450<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:49.709> trading<00:03:50.709> in

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
batteries so I was 450 with trading in

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.569 
batteries so I was 450 with trading in
one<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.189> my<00:03:52.650> 5500<00:03:53.650> units<00:03:53.769> that<00:03:54.099> was<00:03:54.250> kind<00:03:54.549> of

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
one of my 5500 units that was kind of

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.000 
one of my 5500 units that was kind of
like<00:03:54.669> that<00:03:54.909> but<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.329> little<00:03:55.569> older<00:03:55.919> had<00:03:56.919> it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
like that but a little older had it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.259 
like that but a little older had it
breaks<00:03:57.250> overhead<00:03:57.669> valve<00:03:57.909> on<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:59.609> I<00:04:00.609> think

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
breaks overhead valve on it and I think

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.030 
breaks overhead valve on it and I think
it<00:04:01.359> gave<00:04:01.480> me<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.659> good<00:04:01.810> deal<00:04:01.930> he<00:04:02.200> had<00:04:02.319> it<00:04:02.469> posted

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
it gave me a good deal he had it posted

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.789 
it gave me a good deal he had it posted
for<00:04:03.189> 800<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:05.489> we<00:04:06.489> kind<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.790> met<00:04:06.909> halfway<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
for 800 so we kind of met halfway on the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.000 
for 800 so we kind of met halfway on the
price<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:09.400> made<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.150> work<00:04:10.389> out<00:04:11.010> probably

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
price and made that work out probably

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.920 
price and made that work out probably
about<00:04:12.159> a<00:04:12.219> five<00:04:12.489> gallon<00:04:12.700> gas<00:04:13.030> tank<00:04:13.359> it's<00:04:13.719> pretty

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
about a five gallon gas tank it's pretty

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.620 
about a five gallon gas tank it's pretty
big<00:04:15.419> this<00:04:16.419> thing<00:04:16.479> is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
big this thing is

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.759 
big this thing is
probably<00:04:19.630> almost<00:04:19.780> as<00:04:20.049> heavy<00:04:20.169> as<00:04:20.409> a<00:04:20.470> garden

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
probably almost as heavy as a garden

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.490 
probably almost as heavy as a garden
tractor<00:04:21.190> eyes<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.880> serious<00:04:22.180> GT<00:04:22.599> this

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
tractor eyes like a serious GT this

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.159 
tractor eyes like a serious GT this
thing<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:23.889> really<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.490> monster<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.960> that's

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
thing is really a monster but that's

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.200 
thing is really a monster but that's
what<00:04:26.320> we<00:04:26.440> need<00:04:26.620> because<00:04:27.449> last<00:04:28.449> time<00:04:28.570> we<00:04:28.690> had<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
what we need because last time we had a

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.990 
what we need because last time we had a
emergency<00:04:31.210> we<00:04:32.020> had<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.199> run<00:04:32.430> generators<00:04:33.430> for

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
emergency we had to run generators for

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.899 
emergency we had to run generators for
about<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.599> week<00:04:34.780> on<00:04:35.020> end<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.760> any<00:04:38.460> any<00:04:39.460> time<00:04:39.760> we

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
about a week on end and any any time we

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.999 
about a week on end and any any time we
had<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.240> run<00:04:40.449> everything<00:04:41.409> we<00:04:41.740> were<00:04:41.830> using

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
had to run everything we were using

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.730 
had to run everything we were using
three<00:04:42.400> generators<00:04:43.080> one<00:04:44.080> for<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.409> hot<00:04:44.560> water

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
three generators one for the hot water

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.089 
three generators one for the hot water
heater<00:04:45.090> one<00:04:46.090> for<00:04:46.389> all<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.380> main<00:04:47.560> things<00:04:47.889> and

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
heater one for all the main things and

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.050 
heater one for all the main things and
then<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.280> small<00:04:48.580> one<00:04:48.759> for<00:04:49.349> a<00:04:50.909> couple<00:04:51.909> things

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
then a small one for a couple things

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.279 
then a small one for a couple things
another<00:04:52.330> on<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.659> other<00:04:52.780> part<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.169> house

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
another on the other part of the house

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.939 
another on the other part of the house
so<00:04:53.650> I'm<00:04:54.159> hoping<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:54.639> just<00:04:55.120> rely<00:04:55.449> on<00:04:55.949> this

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
so I'm hoping I can just rely on this

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.430 
so I'm hoping I can just rely on this
unit<00:04:57.729> and<00:04:57.849> just<00:04:58.449> have<00:04:58.599> one<00:04:58.990> other<00:04:59.139> one<00:04:59.320> as<00:04:59.409> a

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
unit and just have one other one as a

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.920 
unit and just have one other one as a
backup<00:04:59.650> and<00:05:00.099> that'll<00:05:00.610> be<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:00.880> because<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.479> Kay

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
backup and that'll be it because a Kay

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.100 
backup and that'll be it because a Kay
should<00:05:02.289> be<00:05:02.440> able<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.650> handle<00:05:02.919> hot<00:05:03.039> water<00:05:03.310> and

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
should be able to handle hot water and

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.330 
should be able to handle hot water and
the<00:05:05.110> other<00:05:05.139> things<00:05:05.560> all<00:05:05.830> by<00:05:05.979> itself

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
the other things all by itself

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.909 
the other things all by itself
that's<00:05:09.340> what<00:05:09.460> I'm<00:05:09.550> shooting<00:05:09.729> for
