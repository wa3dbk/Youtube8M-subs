damn<00:00:39.230> tree<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.460> think

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
damn tree but now I really I think

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.100 
damn tree but now I really I think
there's<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.270> home<00:00:42.510> button<00:00:42.750> again

they're not dropping the home button yet
next<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.530> size<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> shape<00:00:47.700> roughly<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
next I think size and shape roughly the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
next I think size and shape roughly the
same<00:00:48.750> speed<00:00:49.820> roughly<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.059> same<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:52.020> could

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
same speed roughly the same they could

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.910 
same speed roughly the same they could
put<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.949> an<00:00:53.100> a6<00:00:53.730> processor<00:00:54.110> quad<00:00:55.110> come<00:00:55.379> ha

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
put in an a6 processor quad come ha

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.099 
put in an a6 processor quad come ha
don't<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.730> I'm<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.600> hard<00:00:57.750> two<00:00:57.809> percent

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
don't know but I'm not hard two percent

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.110 
don't know but I'm not hard two percent
sure<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.280> am<00:00:59.489> quite<00:00:59.820> sure<00:00:59.850> on

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
sure on that but what I am quite sure on

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.049 
sure on that but what I am quite sure on
I<00:01:00.539> hope<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.550> they're

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
I hope I'm right is I think they're

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.929 
I hope I'm right is I think they're
adding<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> Retina<00:01:03.690> display<00:01:04.140> Siri<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.280> an

adding a Retina display Siri and an

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.350 
adding a Retina display Siri and an
improved<00:01:06.330> camera<00:01:06.810> nothing<00:01:07.740> funky<00:01:08.150> super<00:01:09.150> fun

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
improved camera nothing funky super fun

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.660

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
k just improve all right but I don't

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.240 
k just improve all right but I don't
want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.680> why<00:01:16.680> would<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> want<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250

upgrade<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.540> ok<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.350> thinking

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
upgrade just for that ok I'm thinking

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
upgrade just for that ok I'm thinking
the<00:01:19.740> price<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.310> about<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> same<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.659> if

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
