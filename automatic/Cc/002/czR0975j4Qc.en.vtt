00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 Bremen 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
 IT 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 I am 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 If you ask yourself what I have ever done, do me so many 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.500
 that said that Christoph Strässer 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 although the theory 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.960
 POR 0 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.740
 he plays 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.150
 Must zero 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.820
 amongst other things 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 Weidmann main character has so terribly much stress 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.689
 the team of Frank Zimmermann then powerless Thomas box competitive games 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.010
 traffic lights 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.310
 Becker 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.490
 No possible Niki Lauda in Maierhof my work actually traveling in the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310
 offer 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
 around 20 helpers on the spot 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 get started and Baxter is mostly 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 if my ax vw-man slippers 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 baseball bats making suggestion inside 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.930
 but values ​​became 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 it took hold of him 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.230
 to look with the stickers stop 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.990
 I move with the world at the airport 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 in this green glow area here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.210
 Horst Seehofer 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 with the second and many places 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.240
 I'm just happy this way 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 If they are mutated and stress levels, then the game is over 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.799
 you can lower that by suspecting 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.510
 the broken car were out of these things about the positive stuff 1 1 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.229
 those of earthquakes 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.349
 that's the third more to play 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.349
 and also includes strength for the first time 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.089
 The game will have been current German mid-Schopfe 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.089
 but with the nice hint that the game does not appear in Germany 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.309
 The game itself is completely in German 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.839
 and because the hospital is about women neither in which one claims two 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:46.689
 English people 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.689
 Bocholt - a German billion and 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.769
 800 points art man 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.639
 practiced with the family and most of all very fourth attack and 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.429
 to throw in things 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.429
 to jump in the Mediterranean 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.629
 we are looking for missing people 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.629
 Posco is dwindling more and more 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.879
 the problem is the phone calls as comets are around the security guards 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.999
 for telephone and only then on 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.669
 so the divers one after the other that means for Michael Hüsing phones 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.119
 right from the start, data 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.119
 but then I have to run back in the level 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.279
 frond 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.510
 then dodge the shot or can seize this too 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.749
 Cockpit can kick 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.239
 Marco Kutscher the automaton not 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 No could not be beat 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.459
 to be heard 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.129
 will teach here 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.129
 Brigitte Bardot's nerves go 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.969
 the player is moved at the auction 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.090
 maybe the US exploits the EBA or Nintendo said nee itself 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.090
 Do not see Bonn Germany because he has a reputation to lose 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.889
 Pauli but in vain has made Warner Bros 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.860
 but powerless 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.639
 Arabs and Turks 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.599
 after six and seven 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.389
 now comes the psycho copier 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.800
 the whole thing will always be with »Comex cutscenes 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.849
 explained 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.849
 and now that important copiers are removing growth or something 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.759
 Bridgehead the rake right 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.509
 Hamburg dapd 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.809
 I understand he announced Merkel 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.809
 then a bit tired but not even buy 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.349
 The battles are actually quite simple 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.439
 from strange to what a lot of everyday objects you do 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.439
 may compete 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.240
 many freaks 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.699
 Dr 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.229
 People have had time since then, he does not bet on them 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.569
 which is the last phone call 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.360
 Target markets are canceled play it there is the strictest Reli five ICE 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.869
 So have the best destructiveness 

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.669
 that the publisher relieves stress 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.199
 Back then, she was right on the job at the edge of this game is more fun 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.389
 as stress degrades 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.389
 clearly the first externally visible light 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.189
 but at least you can get the impression 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.270
 At the same time, residents heard 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.009
 Pfullendorf I find them 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.009
 I'm afraid 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.249
 because the Rena long 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:34.580
 Moron been 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.580
 to participate 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.979
 give the strongest 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.199
 that's the bosses based 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.969
 today, the counter-deal percent clear it's not the euro 

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:00.779
 at the vet 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.260
 so beautiful it is said 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.129
 "That's the way it is 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.849
 Cohausz clearly from the control one quickly gets a name of some time 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.180
 her school in St 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.690
 maybe my look value 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.020
 safe for special minds 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.379
 through the meager now rip it a bit 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:22.809
 to let it or to stress yourself because you are too quiet 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.229
 I think that's Audio CD until next time 

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:28.679
 Kremlin leader
