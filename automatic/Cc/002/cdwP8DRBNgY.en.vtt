00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.559 
something to think about look I think

cigarette butt on a child's ass I do you
don't<00:06:43.660> see<00:06:43.900> a<00:06:43.930> difference<00:06:44.140> there<00:06:44.880> is<00:06:45.880> that

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
don't see a difference there is that

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.060
