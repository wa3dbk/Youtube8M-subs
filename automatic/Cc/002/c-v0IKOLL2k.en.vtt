00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.720
 occasion we are going to preheat the oven to 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.720
 180 degrees Celsius 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.609
 good high thing let's start with 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.020
 the principle as in everything would be 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:27.679
 start then with the eggs 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.520
 Blessed be God and there goes the second 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.520

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.560

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.210
 I will also start to beat them a little 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.830
 before adding the sugar 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:49.540
 that I know that everyone here 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.540
 they are already thinking that the fabric 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.290
 exact is the classic in our classic 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.850

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.000
 now the sugar 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.510
 Sometimes you have to 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.920
 break it a little bit 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.920
 to start creams 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.490

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.489
 if the most scornik athlete is the most 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.489
 and this time if you win, I had more 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.960
 well yes it's true more skates and that 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.590
 counts as an exercise 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.470

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.340
 mix egg with sugar and now we're going 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.300
 to add him I want to fluff a 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.490
 little bit more lots because we're going to 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.570

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.570
 Oil 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.830
 as slowly as they can 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.680
 without despair 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.650
 slowly 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.489
 Now we are going to add where is my 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.489

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.230
 let's add the cream now 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.299
 to incorporate 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.640
 now we are going to add the mash 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.970
 Now we are going to add the essence of 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.970
 vanilla 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.720
 and now if my moment of truth is going 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.070
 there is holy boy of atocha today I'm going with 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.020
 I'm going to lower the flour at speed 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.020
 whose dawn is there goes 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.420
 but I 'm going well it's exploding but 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.420
 up they saw 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.310
 it did not take away where 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:35.540
 no longer but it is what is splashing 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.540
 I'm Leslie's fault 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.889
 la la la 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.720
 what do I do 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.570
 Well, look, it's fine 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.420
 but it was the explosion was the explosion 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.710
 but pere but let's make the candle of 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.870
 over here 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.360
 the chaca is already seen as clean as 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.650
 full and shoes not what fun is cool 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.920
 and shoes do not like poly is for 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.100
 everyone 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:06.409
 this one they already saw the the 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.920
 I'm going to raise it more to speed 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:14.810
 If you do not worry and frost 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:18.350
 and what do you think if we go to 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:22.720
 the seconds we are going to lower in the flour 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.720
 that was up here 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.560
 to incorporate everything 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.630
 do not 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.870
 that at one time I'm going to put 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.430
 the figs 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:42.360
 dehydrated and the nut and 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.360
 baking powder 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.409
 if it's a bomb but what do you think 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.919
 it's autumnal 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.360
 already already the autumn will begin that for me 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.819
 we are already in winter but good water 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.179
 of the sea, so I'll take the 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.179
 climates 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:06.640
 they go they come back to the talk 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.750
 ok everything is already mixed and now what 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.750
 I'm going to do is that 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.160
 let's pour this mixture 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.050
 today with its mere mass or dock 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.670
 what 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:29.980
 section is fine 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.520
 we're going to put it here in a mold that 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:36.840
 It can be the mold of your preference 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.840
 it can also be in the form of bread that 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:44.240
 and we're going to take it to the oven at 180 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:46.580
 degrees for 50 minutes depending 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.460
 also a little 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:54.080
 reading of where they are but 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:58.300
 Well the joke is that the 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.300
 clean stick do not come then 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.940
 once the following information from 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.940
 papers 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.690
 plus
