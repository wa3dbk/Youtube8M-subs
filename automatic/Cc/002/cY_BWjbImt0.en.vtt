00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.730
 like this bkc the association of two 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.000
 people for consequence josef kunz 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.920
 is a genius of design and kul 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.630
 has teamed up with my great father Mario 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.460
 of lucas is an italian immigrant who is 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.890
 come to paris and they have partnered 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.820
 all in the 70 years 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.650
 grandfather already had a workshop 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.879
 before and know each other and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.460
 frequent and I liked their style 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.199
 common they became friends and then 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.790
 they decided to partner to make 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.239
 a race from a big house in paris 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.070
 in fact 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.690
 and to have a bigger wingspan 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.280
 international we are a mix between 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.710
 the English coast and Italian pop 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.059
 ie the Parisian cup on the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.409
 will know buzz that is not very good 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.489
 mediatized we managed to make a 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.739
 compromise that's why it's 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.260
 Parisian besides now make 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.940
 new school that has not helped related to 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.320
 these have and we try to us 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.280
 shows a little more right now we have a 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.870
 sleeve that is a little bit more 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.690
 increased we have a very particular setback 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.979
 with a collar high enough so that's 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.600
 something that I like can 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.979
 from a mental in all 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 vigon cashmere materials all that 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.369
 you want after we will talk about the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.340
 costume actually pieces tran piece the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.659
 tuxedo labit the jacket 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.369
 then we make the doors go 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.560
 deploy custom shirts 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.359
 even for a d quite a fun customer 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.009
 we have fun with him in which are 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.390
 since he is wearing the head of the shirt 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.299
 with the same color as the fabric that we 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.710
 made big case so are for me 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.179
 customized return for the time our 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.409
 specialty is to try to do that 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.329
 the person is very elegant 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.560
 falls well and that afterwards feel 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.250
 comfortable and who are bright in the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.200
 clothes he does 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.399
 after he has a very particular cost 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.229
 will be his style will choose what he 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.579
 wanted so it's more with the client 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.100
 we will know what for him 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.390
 elegance and we are at his service for 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.740
 to be able to make them feel and 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.149
 how do you do for my appointments is 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.640
 lasts about an hour a spider 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.170
 where we try to understand what makes 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.429
 as a craft the objects tell us everything 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.109
 but for example if you are a trade 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.429
 you are always standing up 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.469
 play on the fabric as before the euro 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.640
 that we will actually work on which 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.899
 we will sell if you are as much 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.460
 so it's all the time in the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.979
 rowing transport to all this if you 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.909
 live in asia in europe all 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.500
 factors are very important for 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.420
 to be able to know exactly what is needed 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.069
 then offer him when he tried 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.200
 to do there managed to understand that we have 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.610
 does the analysis one not on the measurements and 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.630
 then we present him with fabrics on 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.319
 try to choose everything they see 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.120
 interior 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.709
 and after that we can prepare fittings 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.109
 there are three fittings for the first 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.969
 times for me there is a customer and a 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.680
 fitting can last boot everything depends if 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.840
 the customer is in a hurry or in no hurry after 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.489
 do it very quickly ten or so 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.840
 minutes otherwise if we have a little more the 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.980
 time to discuss then you have some 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.569
 clients are expressing gentlemen who are 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.459
 ask questions not pass the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.930
 international standards there is room 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.639
 hours who attended with a person 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.689
 who will go up a little bit 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.739
 drop but for example with a single 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.540
 who does the sleeves 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.099
 only one person who will mount it on 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.689
 collar and only one person who will do 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.859
 the buttonholes so it's fine 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.750
 but the button that are made by hand 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.340
 I perceive a specialty because if 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.450
 at not you do it then to do everything 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.739
 to make a jacket must still put 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.199
 70 years to make a gesture 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.699
 so that would be blocked a lot of passes 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.829
 a person on a beautiful every body 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.269
 did not have a pretty good performance 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.650
 important to be able to take out the jackets 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.730
 at the time received as is my 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.139
 grandfather associated themselves there was 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.790
 the group of 5 it was bigger five 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.530
 tailors of France who was a challenge 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.719
 who was scrolling by year and they 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.040
 put their know-how together and 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.810
 it took things together 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.040
 he was doing things to show the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.419
 things together they were doing the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.889
 advertisements all we're here for 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.120
 to grow our profession our sphere 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.590
 candidates our company that's what 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.540
 we appeared to be wearing our name at 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.220
 higher than we can wear it and that's 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.389
 not just ourselves it's with all 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.000
 the professional team to be able to 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.409
 do that bile bile together and I think 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.639
 we are proud of that they are proud 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.449
 also the monkey is why he 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.449
 works in science 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.210
