00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.250
 we launched a high-definition signal emission pilot on terrestrial 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.559
 about three years 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.659
 what we wanted was to demonstrate the viability of that broadcast of that 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:18.259
 high definition signal 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.550
 the Earth day with commercial equipment 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.310
 what we have done now is to make it work to try also 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.249
 demonstrate that high definition signal emission can be done 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 the terrestrial but in this case in 3d 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.420
 we are using 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.540
 basically in terms of mission header the same equipment that 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.030
 we had for our or that they play it plus hd the only thing that we have incorporated 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.449
 now a server that has greater capacity to dismantle 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.750
 contents 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.280
 percent and a percent encoder to 4 something more powerful than we had 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.730
 at that time and the own development system with which we generated the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.700
 sign that company and to be able to do the emission and a 3d filtering system 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.880
 own also to try to improve a little bit 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
 the quality of the signal by the way we are lying 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.470
 percent the same as about three years ago the situation of high 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.540
 definition was incipient 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.900
 and it was not clear what was going to happen and after mining they started 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.680
 the first broadcasts mind subtract but without satellite 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.970
 I believe that the situation of the very similar h is in a situation in 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.990
 these moments also very incipient 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 where maybe people still have a certain amount of trouble working 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.210
 think it can be something really commercial 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.550
 but it is possible that from here to a year and a half with many years mccomie 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.090
 centrally emissions 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.910
 in those people who have it 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.640
 channel to be able to do it 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.990
 satellite seems a natural way because it is easier to get channel but in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.140
 terres that we are about to have the analog shutdown with which you will see 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.920
 more channels and it's possible that 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.600
 percent a religious chain some surprises us in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.140
 brief since commercially even though the standard is not topped 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.370
 I believe that the situation is like so that they begin to some emissions and if 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.450
 you start selling 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 equipment at commercial level 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.470
 It is a thorn 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.280
 that arise due to the demand that some companies make with us 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.539
 we are collaborating 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.959
 that we make transfers of certain by-products or certain 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.229
 developments that we are doing well independently well with them but 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.939
 through agreement does not have the technology but what they have are 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.709
 textile products for sale 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.349
 and sirens a mechanism to be able 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.090
 precisely those products to be able to do is encourage that technology and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.549
 also to be able to give work output to people who are doing 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.949
 research with us inside
