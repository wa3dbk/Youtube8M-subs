00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
make a mod in Minecraft using a program

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.390 
make a mod in Minecraft using a program
called<00:00:09.790> Eclipse<00:00:10.790> and<00:00:11.920> what's<00:00:12.920> less<00:00:13.130> than<00:00:13.309> you

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
called Eclipse and what's less than you

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.860 
called Eclipse and what's less than you
accomplished<00:00:13.850> last<00:00:14.510> thing<00:00:14.750> I've

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
accomplished is making my own item which

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.800 
accomplished is making my own item which
is<00:00:18.770> going<00:00:19.010> to<00:00:19.250> be<00:00:19.369> able<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:19.610> craft<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.570> other

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
is going to be able to craft the other

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.410 
is going to be able to craft the other
two<00:00:21.170> items<00:00:21.590> I've<00:00:21.740> created<00:00:22.130> which<00:00:22.850> are<00:00:23.060> called

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
two items I've created which are called

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.620 
two items I've created which are called
the<00:00:24.170> carbon<00:00:24.800> sword<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.789> carbon<00:00:26.210> pick<00:00:26.420> X

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
the carbon sword and carbon pick X

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.720 
the carbon sword and carbon pick X
because<00:00:27.020> this<00:00:27.170> mod<00:00:27.440> is<00:00:27.740> called<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.279> carbon

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
because this mod is called the carbon

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.400 
because this mod is called the carbon
mod<00:00:28.910> its<00:00:29.300> carbon<00:00:29.539> mod<00:00:29.810> are<00:00:30.020> kind<00:00:30.170> of<00:00:30.230> cool

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
mod its carbon mod are kind of cool

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.189 
mod its carbon mod are kind of cool
which<00:00:30.560> is<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.770> new<00:00:30.890> material<00:00:31.400> kar<00:00:31.910> buin<00:00:32.419> and

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
which is the new material kar buin and

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.590 
which is the new material kar buin and
so<00:00:33.440> now<00:00:33.679> what's<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.129> third<00:00:34.460> item<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:35.390> you've

created so if if you come in here into

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.619 
created so if if you come in here into
Minecraft<00:00:39.769> says<00:00:40.399> source<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:42.339> assets<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.850> my

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
mod textures and then in items we have

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.860 
mod textures and then in items we have
my<00:00:48.379> item<00:00:48.829> my<00:00:49.339> pickaxe<00:00:49.729> and<00:00:50.089> my<00:00:50.269> sword<00:00:50.539> which<00:00:50.749> I

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
what's that I haven't seen yeah

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.830 
what's that I haven't seen yeah
carbon<00:01:07.580> ingot<00:01:08.300> so<00:01:08.660> that's<00:01:08.810> an<00:01:08.900> ingot<00:01:09.170> yes<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:11.810> I

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
carbon ingot so that's an ingot yes so I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.030 
carbon ingot so that's an ingot yes so I
I<00:01:12.680> use<00:01:12.920> shaders<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:16.570> smooth<00:01:17.570> things<00:01:18.200> out<00:01:18.650> and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
I use shaders and smooth things out and

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.130 
I use shaders and smooth things out and
gives<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.640> texture<00:01:20.510> II<00:01:20.600> feel<00:01:20.930> of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
gives it the texture II feel of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:33.610 
gives it the texture II feel of
Minecraft<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.160> this<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.400> gimpy<00:01:22.880> yes<00:01:32.380> it's<00:01:33.380> an

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
Minecraft so this is gimpy yes it's an

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.120 
Minecraft so this is gimpy yes it's an
expanded<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:38.570> got<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.810> little<00:01:39.200> stick<00:01:39.590> yeah

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
expanded it's got a little stick yeah

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.460 
expanded it's got a little stick yeah
it's<00:01:40.880> cool<00:01:41.090> though<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.510> mean<00:01:41.690> I'm<00:01:41.840> sure<00:01:42.110> when

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
it's cool though I mean I'm sure when

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.750 
it's cool though I mean I'm sure when
you're<00:01:42.590> looking<00:01:42.770> at<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:42.950> when<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:43.400> pixelated

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
you're looking at it when it's pixelated

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.090 
you're looking at it when it's pixelated
like<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:45.170> can<00:01:45.350> look<00:01:45.500> different<00:01:45.560> than<00:01:46.010> it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
like this it can look different than it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.910 
like this it can look different than it
does<00:01:46.250> when<00:01:46.490> you're<00:01:46.670> at<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:47.420> stick<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.800> think

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
does when you're at a stick so I think

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.560 
does when you're at a stick so I think
this<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:49.400> my<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.780> thing<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.740> most

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
this is my the thing I like the most

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.850 
this is my the thing I like the most
which<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:54.730> whoops<00:01:56.740> backwards<00:01:58.870> so

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
which is whoops backwards so

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.020 
which is whoops backwards so
this<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.180> carbon<00:02:02.750> sword<00:02:03.260> it<00:02:04.190> has<00:02:04.400> three

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
this is the carbon sword it has three

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.210 
this is the carbon sword it has three
gems<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.950> gem<00:02:07.220> here<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.820> nice<00:02:08.270> little<00:02:08.509> stick

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
gems and a gem here a nice little stick

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.700 
gems and a gem here a nice little stick
handle<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:11.830> blade<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.300> very<00:02:14.720> easy<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
handle and a blade so it's very easy to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.530 
handle and a blade so it's very easy to
do<00:02:16.010> things<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:16.880> what<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.270> ingot

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
do things like so what is the ingot

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.230 
do things like so what is the ingot
gonna<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.960> used<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:19.400> gonna<00:02:19.610> be<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.940> craft

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
gonna be used for it's gonna be to craft

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240 
gonna be used for it's gonna be to craft
both<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.870> these<00:02:20.990> all<00:02:21.620> right<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:21.920> where's<00:02:22.130> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
both of these all right so where's the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.130 
both of these all right so where's the
code<00:02:22.460> that<00:02:22.760> created<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.270> ingot<00:02:23.540> or<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:24.020> it

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
code that created the ingot or is it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.020 
code that created the ingot or is it
just<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.560> design<00:02:24.890> at<00:02:25.070> this<00:02:25.190> point<00:02:25.460> pretty<00:02:25.880> much

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
just a design at this point pretty much

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.590 
just a design at this point pretty much
just<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.050> designing<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:28.280> just<00:02:28.700> got<00:02:29.000> its<00:02:29.270> code

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
just a designing it just got its code

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.900 
just a designing it just got its code
I've<00:02:30.290> actually<00:02:30.500> not<00:02:30.800> putted<00:02:31.190> sure<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.730> not

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
I've actually not putted sure it's not

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.420 
I've actually not putted sure it's not
coded<00:02:32.390> into<00:02:32.780> Minecraft<00:02:33.020> yet<00:02:33.740> into<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.190> mods

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
coded into Minecraft yet into the mods

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.920 
coded into Minecraft yet into the mods
we<00:02:34.970> can't<00:02:35.270> actually<00:02:35.680> use<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.630> if

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
we can't actually use it it's like if

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
pickaxe work so oh I should probably go

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.729 
pickaxe work so oh I should probably go
um<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.130> can<00:03:31.550> um<00:03:31.700> if<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.780> walk<00:03:33.019> around<00:03:33.200> I

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
um so now I can um if I walk around I

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.370 
um so now I can um if I walk around I
can<00:03:33.980> probably<00:03:34.190> find<00:03:34.489> some<00:03:34.700> stone<00:03:35.360> somewhere

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
can probably find some stone somewhere

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.290 
can probably find some stone somewhere
I<00:03:36.670> remember<00:03:37.670> those<00:03:37.820> from<00:03:38.030> stone<00:03:38.540> over<00:03:38.989> here<00:03:40.300> so

I remember those from stone over here so

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.870 
I remember those from stone over here so
this<00:03:42.019> is<00:03:42.080> as<00:03:42.500> efficient<00:03:43.130> as<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.480> diamond<00:03:44.480> and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
this is as efficient as a diamond and

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:55.540 
this is as efficient as a diamond and
it's<00:03:46.880> like<00:03:49.300> 9999<00:03:50.739> something<00:03:52.540> break<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.830> it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
it's like 9999 something break it so it

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.040 
it's like 9999 something break it so it
works<00:03:55.760> very<00:03:56.000> fast<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.470> can<00:03:57.799> see
