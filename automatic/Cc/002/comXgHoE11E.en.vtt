00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
took to that little Android guide over

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.130 
took to that little Android guide over
there

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
there

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.460 
there
seems<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.290> nice<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.670> also<00:01:48.000> another

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
seems pretty nice this was also another

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.819 
seems pretty nice this was also another
experiment<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.670> dog<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> look

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
experiment and this is to my dog so look

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.149 
experiment and this is to my dog so look
at<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> tail<00:01:53.280> moving<00:01:55.280> very<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.430> nice<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
at the tail moving very very nice and

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.850 
at the tail moving very very nice and
this<00:01:59.159> didn't<00:01:59.520> go<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> well<00:01:59.909> would<00:02:00.710> well<00:02:01.710> but

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
this didn't go that well would well but

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.310 
this didn't go that well would well but
I<00:02:01.920> guess<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
I guess it it's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.450 
I guess it it's
I<00:02:03.350> guess<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:04.310> cool<00:02:04.520> too<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:07.580> one<00:02:09.460> check

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
I guess it's cool too and this one check

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.940 
I guess it's cool too and this one check
