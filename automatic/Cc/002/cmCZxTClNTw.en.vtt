the last generation Note 3 and at least
in<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.769> opinion<00:00:28.859> because<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> 5.7<00:00:30.840> inch

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
in my opinion because you get a 5.7 inch

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.530

that we have a Snapdragon 805 in here so

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.800 
that we have a Snapdragon 805 in here so
that's<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> 2.7<00:01:53.040> gigahertz<00:01:53.310> quad-core<00:01:53.810> from

that's the 2.7 gigahertz quad-core from

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
that's the 2.7 gigahertz quad-core from
Qualcomm<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:55.890> only<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.579> LTE

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
bits octa-core SOC in here so we're

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.960 
bits octa-core SOC in here so we're
talking<00:02:08.330> about<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> samsung<00:02:08.840> exynos<00:02:09.970> 5433

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
talking about the samsung exynos 5433

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.570 
talking about the samsung exynos 5433
which<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.750> also<00:02:12.050> launching<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.250> device

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
which is also launching in this device

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.010 
which is also launching in this device
so<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.360> have<00:02:14.570> four<00:02:15.380> arm<00:02:15.980> cortex<00:02:16.490> a53<00:02:17.150> cores<00:02:17.750> in

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
so we have four arm cortex a53 cores in

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.960 
so we have four arm cortex a53 cores in
here<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.470> four<00:02:19.310> arm<00:02:19.640> context<00:02:20.120> 857<00:02:21.110> or<00:02:22.040> cpu

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970

case<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.270> been<00:02:26.480> slower<00:02:26.690> than<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
case it's been slower than the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.380 
case it's been slower than the
snapdragon<00:02:27.440> chip<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.430> overall<00:02:28.940> the

snapdragon chip but overall the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.390 
snapdragon chip but overall the
performance<00:02:29.960> should<00:02:30.140> pretty<00:02:30.380> much<00:02:30.470> be<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
performance should pretty much be the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.340 
performance should pretty much be the
same<00:02:31.880> let's<00:02:32.480> talk<00:02:32.660> about<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.990> rest<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.230> the

another mic and Samsung is using this
for<00:04:36.730> directional<00:04:37.300> recording<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.290> can

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
for directional recording so you can

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.610 
for directional recording so you can
switch<00:04:39.340> between<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.630> voice<00:04:40.840> sources<00:04:41.350> so<00:04:41.470> when

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
recorded in noisy areas like where we

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.550 
recorded in noisy areas like where we
are<00:04:56.830> right<00:04:57.040> here<00:04:57.730> so<00:04:58.180> this<00:04:58.750> is<00:04:58.900> where<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.380> pen

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
what I did forget to mention is that

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.290 
what I did forget to mention is that
this<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.420> just<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.960> standard<00:05:05.650> micro<00:05:06.640> USB<00:05:07.060> 2.0
