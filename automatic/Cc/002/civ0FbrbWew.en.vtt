00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.390
 Call made especially 10 o'clock 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.700
 in the morning and everyone is in school and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.910
 wonder that I have not answered 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.940
 history and you know yes 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.129
 I've certainly always determined mine 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.430
 something like this is one of those 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.579
 online trade-a-game where you have no idea 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 so smock pixel management race differently 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.460
 around and can say hello this is me 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.290
 so friend on the internet and that is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.560
 stop very funny there we want in 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.240
 Such a resort hotel there was a moderator 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 and a friend of mine was there too 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.320
 presenter of this boom trousers so currently 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.130
 made a youtube channel and this one 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.560
 booms pants 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.180
 after all I even find myself quite 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 I was cool about twelve or so 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.600
 I call myself boom story and me 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.049
 do not have any kind of raised dog food 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.590
 and so on thought no I found that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.060
 Names just cool and that's why yes 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.829
 next question and although this rest comes 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.659
 place and he writes how do you imagine 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.369
 your future on youtube is that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.990
 actually a very good question because you 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.479
 After all, it always makes you wonder how 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.520
 we will be in the future youtube in 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.990
 How will youtube be in five years? 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.939
 be half a year like youtube 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.130
 his morning and all I can say 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 I am a very spontaneous person so 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.759
 if that is now youtube is aiming for 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.799
 another platform around course 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.180
 easy with order so I'm not like that 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.040
 someone who has a big head there 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.990
 How could it be because I think 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.930
 karl stories is perfect though 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.189
 ask the love scenes yes are you this 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.840
 year at gamescom 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.030
 I can say 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.519
 probably yes so I'm to 80 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.080
 percent on the video days in cologne and 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.480
 at the gamescom in cologne 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.950
 i have this cologne or video days 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.410
 then divided into berlin and cologne 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 I'll probably be in with both 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.220
 but I do not know yet 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.230
 I say yes to only 90 percent yes 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.930
 my brother and the other ten 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.790
 percent i do not know 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.290
 Let's see if that comes off in time 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.049
 I do not know if my brother 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.079
 ever has ferry or whatever 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.840
 so and the bag unicorn if i am in one 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.269
 film could play which would it be 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.239
 I think it would be something like hobbit or 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.819
 this good of panem or the provision 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.069
 because that's one of my favorite movies 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.390
 are 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.700
 I have to say I think the determination 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.890
 mega i like the story behind it 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.349
 but I the good also very cool but 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.019
 does it stop also as a film because getting 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.819
 I goose bumps so generally has the 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.239
 the rings and so on until now 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.340
 unfortunately already over but what should 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.600
 I think I find the movies mega and 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.819
 If I think I would have the choice 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.350
 I play one of the two movie 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.200
 then arne 2468 writes cola or fanta 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.420
 I have to say that I'm more for 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.519
 totally the cola fendt bees cola cola 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.079
 cola but eventually I have to 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.190
 a lot of cola drunk that my belly almost 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.569
 I burst then I have a contract 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.959
 drunk and now I was found quite 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.730
 with pleasure 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.349
 although I have to say that I am both 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.359
 still likes to like it when I'm mostly 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.160
 somewhere something and then eat what 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.440
 probably me mostly without cola 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.799
 but in the meantime I always have one in the cinema 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.430
 Fanta that has somehow so devoted then 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:50.579
 asks sandy or cotton candy in which 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.190
 countries is already true and where I like 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.020
 still if I had the opportunity 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.950
 would have to 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.450
 i was already there germany i have yes 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.980
 Also usual I originally me 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.050
 from Austria and I live here too 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.310
 I have never been to Switzerland 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.050
 I've been to Croatia and Italy 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.300

 yes that was somehow with mike huster 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.410
 Holidays in Paris because I was in Italy 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.310
 I was still there with the school of Croatia 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.530
 No more and then I was like that somehow 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.050
 flown in paris for the first time and so on 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.120
 further quote extremely cool experience 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.720

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.000

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.370

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:43.650
