00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.800 
with the other row make it stable
there<00:02:13.680> alright<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.360> what<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.690> going

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
there alright so this is what it's going

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.330 
there alright so this is what it's going
to<00:02:15.870> look<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.080> except<00:02:16.770> it's<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.220> be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to look like except it's going to be

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.600 
to look like except it's going to be
dirt<00:02:17.550> block<00:02:17.790> ah<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.380> really<00:02:19.620> matter<00:02:19.800> so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
dirt block ah but it's really matter so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.690 
dirt block ah but it's really matter so
now<00:02:20.730> you're<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> get<00:02:21.270> your<00:02:21.570> hoe<00:02:21.960> and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
now you're going to get your hoe and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.800 
now you're going to get your hoe and
their<00:02:23.700> seeds<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:26.270> so<00:02:27.270> you're<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> hoe

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
their seeds and so you're going to hoe

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.370 
their seeds and so you're going to hoe
one<00:02:28.710> row<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.850> recommend<00:02:30.330> having<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.170> end

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
one row and I recommend having the end

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.600 
one row and I recommend having the end
rows<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.720> two<00:02:33.960> separate<00:02:34.380> seeds<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.040> this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
rows for the two separate seeds and this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.060 
rows for the two separate seeds and this
row<00:02:35.790> will<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.600> weed<00:02:37.320> seeds<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.920> can

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
row will be for weed seeds and you can

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.700 
row will be for weed seeds and you can
also<00:02:41.190> use<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> middle<00:02:41.760> row<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.410> one

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
also use the middle row for just one

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.510 
also use the middle row for just one
seed<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.610> split<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.240> two<00:02:45.600> um<00:02:46.520> to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
seed or you can split it in two um to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.430 
seed or you can split it in two um to
split<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.060> seeds<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.170> half

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
split the seeds so you can have one half

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.160 
split the seeds so you can have one half
Mountain<00:02:50.280> seeds<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.850> then<00:02:51.240> one<00:02:51.510> half<00:02:51.810> of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
Mountain seeds and then one half of

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.000 
Mountain seeds and then one half of
wheat<00:02:53.010> seeds<00:02:53.660> I'll<00:02:54.660> do<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.080> after<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.710> finish

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
wheat seeds I'll do that after I finish

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.100 
wheat seeds I'll do that after I finish
this<00:02:56.160> row<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.420> now<00:02:57.570> we're<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:57.960> our

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
this row so now we're going to get our

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.210 
this row so now we're going to get our
melon<00:02:58.410> seeds<00:02:58.650> and<00:03:00.380> by<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.440> way<00:03:01.620> melon<00:03:02.040> seeds

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
melon seeds and by the way melon seeds

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.910 
melon seeds and by the way melon seeds
look<00:03:02.490> just<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:02.970> pumpkin<00:03:03.210> seeds<00:03:03.920> when

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
look just like pumpkin seeds when

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.290 
look just like pumpkin seeds when
they're<00:03:05.100> growing<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:05.850> they<00:03:06.000> are<00:03:06.090> actually

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
they're growing but they are actually

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.890 
they're growing but they are actually
melon<00:03:06.810> seeds<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.560> remember<00:03:07.800> that

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
melon seeds so just remember that

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.740 
melon seeds so just remember that
especially<00:03:09.900> if<00:03:10.020> you're<00:03:10.170> doing<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.590> in

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
going to do the middle row and we're

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.980 
going to do the middle row and we're
going<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:19.760> half<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.030> half<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.780> we're<00:03:21.900> going

and this will be wheat seeds will just

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.960 
and this will be wheat seeds will just
put<00:03:54.690> wheat<00:03:54.870> actually<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.710> then<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.640> will<00:03:56.850> be

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
put wheat actually and then this will be

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.560 
put wheat actually and then this will be
melon
