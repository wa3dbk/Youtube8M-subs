00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
going to do the other side so this is a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.530 
going to do the other side so this is a
darker<00:04:07.010> shade<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.670> reason<00:04:07.970> I'm<00:04:08.090> using<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
really could have gotten away with doing

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.370 
really could have gotten away with doing
this<00:04:16.400> one<00:04:16.730> but<00:04:17.270> i'll<00:04:17.420> probably<00:04:17.690> do<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.080> one
