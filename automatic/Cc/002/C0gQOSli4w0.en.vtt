00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.300 
there and play that's all I'm thinking
about<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.630> can't<00:03:37.960> be<00:03:38.320> focused<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.800> other<00:03:38.980> stuff

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
about I can't be focused on other stuff

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.300 
about I can't be focused on other stuff
but<00:03:39.490> my<00:03:39.640> games<00:03:39.880> gonna<00:03:40.120> suffer<00:03:40.770> then<00:03:41.770> again<00:03:42.070> I

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
but my games gonna suffer then again I

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.330 
but my games gonna suffer then again I
guess<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.940> wasn't<00:03:43.240> all<00:03:43.300> that<00:03:43.330> good<00:03:43.630> tonight<00:03:43.780> so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
guess it wasn't all that good tonight so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.500 
guess it wasn't all that good tonight so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
maybe I should be focusing on other

00:03:46.510 --> 00:04:00.380 
maybe I should be focusing on other
things
