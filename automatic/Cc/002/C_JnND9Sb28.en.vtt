00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.440
 my name is Natalia today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.540
 talk about seriously angry and cheap 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.240
 products that really has 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 the effect is primarily herbs 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.310
 which we can purchase in the pharmacy them 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.220
 No decoctions are very useful for our hair 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.750
 especially if we use regularly 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.769
 this daisy hop cones and sprinkler 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.660
 really they are very good 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.109
 restore your hair and they 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.710
 infusion also become more shiny 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.780
 chamomile brightens your hair a little 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 the next product is henna i'm sorry 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 have not yet found the perfect one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.829
 did not completely dye her hair as 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.250
 it's easy to appreciate who knows 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.910
 redhead and so she recovers well 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.309
 hair and gives a lamination effect that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 very important in the summer when the hair is very 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.079
 dry too you can add it 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.010
 in masks to use instead of shampoo 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.080
 a very useful thing next is the product 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 which we can basically find on 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.030
 the kitchen is coffee grains which i 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.549
 I recommend milk such a powder and 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.950
 do skype than we tie how better 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.369
 so I still recommend beans and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.799
 grind yourself really it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.640
 very useful and has fat burning 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.570
 sort of effect next product is 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.470
 ordinary shim lemon can wash it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.770
 wipe your face can also strengthen our 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.960
 marigolds using lemon especially 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.840
 they can restore nails if you 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.720
 washed off very badly for example 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.540
 red and nails and are in terrible 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.490
 able to just dunk in it new 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.000
 nails for 15-20 minutes everything will be fine 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.369
 next product, it does not 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.259
 standard is tooth powder from 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.950
 which, in principle, has long been everything 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.070
 refused 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.280
 he cleans his teeth well removes tooth 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.229
 stone if there is one but especially 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.540
 whitening effect if you are from 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.060
 nature teeth yellow hope not worth it 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.110
 but he will bleach up your natural 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.120
 hue the next product is oil 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.270
 which we can purchase at the pharmacy 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.849
 vitamin e and a works very well in 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.330
 a pair so it was best to use them 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.060
 one to one solution very well they 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.099
 act on skin repair and and 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.930
 make it more dense especially this 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.290
 touches the area under the eyes 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.730
 but still some write that they 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.099
 remove wrinkles 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.769
 I unfortunately have such an effect for 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.200
 I did not notice the month 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.450
 castor oil and she is enough 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.170
 everyone knows she is excellent 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.610
 restores cilia makes them more 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.709
 dense and due to this they are less 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.730
 break down the same way she can make them 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 a little darker but not the only 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.810
 option of using this oil is also 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.140
 it can add oil masks for 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.840
 hair and it is especially effective on 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.790
 tips as it feeds them at the expense of its 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.220
 very oily nature and what else do I give you 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.349
 I'll tell you about my funny 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.379
 opening during the trek it 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:29.129
 use of such thing as 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.140
 toilet paper she is perfect 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.840
 washes makeup I don't know why but 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.019
 it is precisely this brand and forget-me-not she 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.690
 washes well makeup especially if you 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.450
 allergic and smells like chamomile nice 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.500
 I haven't met any napkins before 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.510
 funny well and remains gelatin which we 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 we can use the mask can also 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.239
 use it in face mask 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.909
 now I hope if you are interested in some 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.920
 masks with it or with other elements 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.680

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.490
