00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
balls in the summer coming off a lot of

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.369 
balls in the summer coming off a lot of
them<00:03:03.879> were<00:03:04.359> not<00:03:04.659> necessarily<00:03:04.810> getting<00:03:05.290> the

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
them were not necessarily getting the

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.319 
them were not necessarily getting the
initial<00:03:05.769> assist<00:03:06.129> but<00:03:06.849> they<00:03:06.970> were<00:03:07.030> causing

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
initial assist but they were causing

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.569 
initial assist but they were causing
damage<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.049> area<00:03:08.379> which<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.220> all<00:03:09.340> what<00:03:09.489> you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
damage in the area which is all what you

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.949 
damage in the area which is all what you
want<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.819> Huber<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.239> crossing<00:03:10.629> you<00:03:10.750> want<00:03:10.900> to

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
want the Huber that crossing you want to

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.420 
want the Huber that crossing you want to
try<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.200> score<00:03:11.379> from<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.739> whether<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.129> be<00:03:12.280> from

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
try and score from it whether it be from

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.550 
try and score from it whether it be from
the<00:03:12.579> initial<00:03:12.760> cross<00:03:13.120> itself<00:03:13.420> or<00:03:14.079> it<00:03:14.349> going

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
the initial cross itself or it going

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.080 
the initial cross itself or it going
eventually<00:03:14.799> you<00:03:15.549> can<00:03:15.670> see<00:03:15.819> the<00:03:15.940> high

the scraps now he oh she's got this run
it<00:03:25.150> looked<00:03:25.329> like<00:03:25.419> the<00:03:25.569> guy<00:03:25.690> stop<00:03:25.959> playing<00:03:26.199> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
it looked like the guy stop playing the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.569 
it looked like the guy stop playing the
guy<00:03:26.410> was<00:03:26.560> beating<00:03:26.829> me<00:03:26.919> it<00:03:26.980> was<00:03:27.069> pretty<00:03:27.190> much<00:03:27.400> at

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
guy was beating me it was pretty much at

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.039 
guy was beating me it was pretty much at
the<00:03:27.639> end<00:03:27.849> of<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:27.970> game<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.540> took<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.780> run

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
the end of the game I just took a run

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.509 
the end of the game I just took a run
and<00:03:29.199> I<00:03:29.500> think<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.889> just<00:03:29.980> caught<00:03:30.250> him<00:03:30.340> off<00:03:30.489> guard

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
and I think I just caught him off guard

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.539 
and I think I just caught him off guard
of<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.930> how<00:03:32.500> do<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.709> feel<00:03:32.889> about<00:03:32.980> him<00:03:33.370> I'm

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
of that but how do I feel about him I'm

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.309 
of that but how do I feel about him I'm
giving<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:33.879> 7i<00:03:34.239> 10<00:03:34.510> I'm<00:03:34.599> being<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> little<00:03:34.840> bit

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
giving this 7i 10 I'm being a little bit

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.319 
giving this 7i 10 I'm being a little bit
generous<00:03:35.590> giving<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.919> 7<00:03:36.220> out<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.340> 10<00:03:36.459> because<00:03:37.000> he

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
generous giving a 7 out of 10 because he

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.839 
generous giving a 7 out of 10 because he
was<00:03:37.540> good<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.650> only<00:03:39.129> good<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.400> terms<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.699> him

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
was good but only good in terms of him

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.339 
was good but only good in terms of him
have<00:03:39.970> been<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.150> little<00:03:40.510> bit<00:03:40.810> better<00:03:40.959> than<00:03:41.199> he's

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
have been a little bit better than he's

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.890 
have been a little bit better than he's
upgraded<00:03:41.829> card<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.790> if<00:03:43.180> he's<00:03:43.419> gonna<00:03:43.629> stick

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
upgraded card so if he's gonna stick

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.080

around<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.260> firm<00:03:44.470> 2k<00:03:44.799> price<00:03:45.099> I'd<00:03:45.730> always

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
around that firm 2k price I'd always

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.119 
around that firm 2k price I'd always
rather<00:03:46.239> just<00:03:46.599> get<00:03:46.750> upgraded<00:03:47.230> version<00:03:47.739> lag<00:03:47.919> and

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
rather just get upgraded version lag and

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.670 
rather just get upgraded version lag and
especially<00:03:48.879> with<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.660> chance<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.169> a<00:03:50.290> team<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
especially with the chance of a team the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
season card of him he could sneak onto

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.759 
season card of him he could sneak onto
the<00:03:52.480> bench<00:03:52.660> because<00:03:52.870> other<00:03:53.109> marvelous<00:03:53.620> ease

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
the bench because other marvelous ease

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.890 
the bench because other marvelous ease
of<00:03:53.919> a<00:03:54.010> Southampton<00:03:54.389> but<00:03:55.389> I<00:03:55.419> don't<00:03:55.690> know<00:03:55.810> if

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
of a Southampton but I don't know if

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.449 
of a Southampton but I don't know if
would<00:03:56.079> seem<00:03:56.379> in<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.799> hit<00:03:56.949> or<00:03:56.980> miss<00:03:57.099> if<00:03:57.340> he

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
would seem in it's a hit or miss if he

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.610 
would seem in it's a hit or miss if he
could<00:03:57.639> sneak<00:03:57.879> his<00:03:58.060> way<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:59.109> cold<00:03:59.379> cod

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
could sneak his way in and that cold cod

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.229 
could sneak his way in and that cold cod
had<00:03:59.769> probably<00:04:00.040> end<00:04:00.159> up<00:04:00.250> being<00:04:00.489> cheaper<00:04:00.519> and

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
had probably end up being cheaper and

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.199 
had probably end up being cheaper and
probably<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.169> bit<00:04:02.290> better<00:04:02.470> again<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.970> I'm

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
probably a bit better again but I'm
