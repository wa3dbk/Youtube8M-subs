00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
how can we know that it's a sign from an

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.960 
how can we know that it's a sign from an
angel<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.990> not<00:01:15.140> if<00:01:15.830> it's<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.130> loving<00:01:16.430> voice<00:01:16.580> if

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
it's a voice that's telling you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.720 
it's a voice that's telling you
something<00:01:18.560> really<00:01:19.100> good

something really good

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.300 
something really good
then<00:01:20.090> accept<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.110> an<00:01:21.260> angel<00:01:21.500> because

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
then accept that it's an angel because

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.280 
then accept that it's an angel because
you<00:01:22.460> know<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.150> then<00:01:23.330> ask<00:01:23.510> for<00:01:23.780> proof<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
you know if you then ask for proof the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.990 
you know if you then ask for proof the
angel<00:01:24.740> will<00:01:24.920> drop<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.190> little<00:01:25.310> white<00:01:25.700> feather

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
angel will drop a little white feather

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.270 
angel will drop a little white feather
for<00:01:26.300> you<00:01:26.480> or<00:01:26.990> give<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.410> some<00:01:27.680> other<00:01:27.830> sort<00:01:28.190> of

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
for you or give you some other sort of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.250 
for you or give you some other sort of
proof<00:01:28.580> like<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:28.940> walk<00:01:29.180> past<00:01:29.480> somebody<00:01:29.780> who's

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
proof like you walk past somebody who's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.110 
proof like you walk past somebody who's
wearing<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.620> t-shirt<00:01:30.830> with<00:01:31.250> angel<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.820> back

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
wearing a t-shirt with angel on the back

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.630 
wearing a t-shirt with angel on the back
and<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:32.810> look<00:01:33.110> for<00:01:33.410> those<00:01:33.530> little<00:01:33.890> signs<00:01:34.130> and

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
and you look for those little signs and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.850 
and you look for those little signs and
then<00:01:35.120> you<00:01:35.270> can<00:01:35.450> know<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.990> an<00:01:36.140> angel<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.650> light

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
then you can know that an angel of light

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.430 
then you can know that an angel of light
is<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.700> helping<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.300> so<00:01:38.930> it's<00:01:39.110> that's

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
is with you helping you so it's that's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.280 
is with you helping you so it's that's
that<00:01:39.800> that's<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.430> sign<00:01:40.640> rather<00:01:41.030> than<00:01:41.420> because

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
that that's the sign rather than because

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.440 
that that's the sign rather than because
I<00:01:42.560> mean<00:01:42.890> there's<00:01:43.100> many<00:01:43.250> signs<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.820> life<00:01:44.030> so

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
I mean there's many signs in life so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.270 
I mean there's many signs in life so
