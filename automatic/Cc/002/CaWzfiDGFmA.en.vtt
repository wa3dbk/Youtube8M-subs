00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.800 
spot to be in but whatever and here's
some<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.579> bushes<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.180> stuff<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.540> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
some more bushes and stuff like that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.240 
some more bushes and stuff like that
this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.680> bush<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.070> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
this is a pretty good bush because it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
this is a pretty good bush because it's
a<00:01:41.369> dark<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> corner<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> something

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
a dark also in the corner of something

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
a dark also in the corner of something
so<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> don't<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.340> many<00:01:44.549> people<00:01:44.700> would

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
there it's a really dark spot so kind of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.580 
there it's a really dark spot so kind of
hard<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.549> see<00:03:43.760> there's<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.810> original<00:03:44.900> behind

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
hard to see there's the original behind

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.080 
hard to see there's the original behind
the<00:03:45.709> desk<00:03:45.950> back<00:03:46.160> here<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.459> lot<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:46.609> people<00:03:46.910> hide

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.809 
the desk back here a lot of people hide
behind<00:03:47.239> there<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:48.069> might<00:03:49.069> be<00:03:49.250> kind<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.519> obvious

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
behind there so might be kind of obvious

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.129 
behind there so might be kind of obvious
but<00:03:49.850> you'll<00:03:50.180> definitely<00:03:50.299> be<00:03:50.600> one<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.930> last

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
but you'll definitely be one of the last

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.120 
but you'll definitely be one of the last
ones<00:03:51.410> alive<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:53.470> got<00:03:54.470> some<00:03:54.680> more<00:03:54.829> spots
