in the video but I have a lot more algae
growth<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.869> sides<00:01:55.170> which<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.530> mean<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.950> lot

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
growth on the sides which I mean a lot

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.230

of people say have an algae problem

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.690 
of people say have an algae problem
which<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.869> true<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:59.040> only<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> back

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
which is true but it's only on the back

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
which is true but it's only on the back
panels<00:02:00.119> because<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.479> actually<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.200> there

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
panels because I actually want it there

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.840 
panels because I actually want it there
because<00:02:01.500> i<00:02:01.649> don't<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.009> back<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.579> i<00:02:02.670> like

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
because i don't have it back and i like

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.670 
because i don't have it back and i like
it<00:02:03.060> i<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.810> busted<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> little<00:02:04.469> bit

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
it i think it busted out a little bit

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.990 
it i think it busted out a little bit
and<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.040> makes<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.340> look<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> little<00:02:05.579> bit<00:02:05.880> more

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and it makes a look a little bit more

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.219 
and it makes a look a little bit more
natural<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.590> too<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:09.229> um

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
natural and then like up here too on um

of<00:02:25.470> color<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> vase<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> actually

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
of color to the vase here so I actually

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.170 
of color to the vase here so I actually
like<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.430> pretty<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.660> know<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
like it pretty you know I just like the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.060 
like it pretty you know I just like the
natural<00:02:33.360> look<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.810> gets<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.200> agreement<00:02:34.440> so

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
natural look it gets to the agreement so

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.800 
natural look it gets to the agreement so
yeah<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.610> front<00:02:36.000> panels<00:02:36.360> i<00:02:36.480> always<00:02:36.690> keep

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810

cleaning the one on the side there too
and<00:02:38.370> i<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.240> think<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.510> looks<00:02:39.630> pretty<00:02:39.720> great

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
and i just think it looks pretty great

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.280 
and i just think it looks pretty great
but<00:02:40.170> um<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.130> lights<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.490> been<00:02:42.290> pretty

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290

outstanding actually and I've had a lot

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.540 
outstanding actually and I've had a lot
new<00:02:45.630> growth<00:02:45.960> with<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.440> plants<00:02:46.830> but<00:02:47.310> I've<00:02:47.430> had

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550

eaten up some of it if you let your
snails<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.660> these<00:02:54.870> will<00:02:55.560> always<00:02:55.890> eat<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.250> but

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
