00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
nerdery so this is where the magic

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.240 
nerdery so this is where the magic
happens

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
happens

the configurator we also have a lot of

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.609 
the configurator we also have a lot of
customization<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.509> we<00:01:26.570> can<00:01:26.750> do<00:01:26.869> in-house<00:01:27.170> if

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
customization that we can do in-house if

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.200 
customization that we can do in-house if
they<00:01:27.860> want<00:01:28.130> like<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.280> game<00:01:28.490> character<00:01:28.729> let's

they want like a game character let's
edge<00:01:29.450> down<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.780> system<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:30.439> have<00:01:30.590> those

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
edge down the system we have those

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.929 
edge down the system we have those
capabilities<00:01:30.860> in-house<00:01:31.400> we're<00:01:31.610> actually<00:01:31.850> the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
capabilities in-house we're actually the

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.999 
capabilities in-house we're actually the
first<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:32.360> do<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:32.540> long<00:01:33.110> long<00:01:33.350> time<00:01:33.560> ago<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009

first to do it long long time ago you
could<00:01:34.159> see<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.340> level<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.700> detail<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.720> we

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
could see the level of detail that we

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.080 
could see the level of detail that we
can<00:01:36.409> put<00:01:36.710> into<00:01:36.860> these<00:01:37.070> edges<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:37.939> is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
cars we have computers in here we bake

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.730 
cars we have computers in here we bake
them<00:01:56.000> like<00:01:56.180> like<00:01:56.659> they<00:01:56.810> bake<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.170> cars<00:01:57.380> you

actually have to bake the paint after
after<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.689> lay<00:01:59.810> down<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.850> reason<00:02:01.850> why<00:02:02.210> we

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
after you lay down and reason why we

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.760 
after you lay down and reason why we
decided<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.840> do<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.140> ourselves

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770

what you want how you want very cool
each<00:02:56.780> system<00:02:57.410> gets<00:02:58.209> individual<00:02:59.209> attention

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
each system gets individual attention

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.880 
each system gets individual attention
right<00:02:59.720> so<00:02:59.900> we're<00:03:00.050> cutting<00:03:00.200> these<00:03:00.530> tubes<00:03:00.800> to

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
right so we're cutting these tubes to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.680 
right so we're cutting these tubes to
length<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.580> make<00:03:01.760> sure<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.940> our<00:03:02.150> cabling

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
length so make sure that our cabling

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.600 
length so make sure that our cabling
looks<00:03:02.930> at<00:03:03.080> me<00:03:03.170> there's<00:03:03.410> no<00:03:03.650> other<00:03:04.220> purpose

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
looks at me there's no other purpose

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.120 
looks at me there's no other purpose
than<00:03:04.850> just<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.630> have<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.959> look<00:03:06.200> hot<00:03:06.560> that's<00:03:06.950> it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
than just to have it look hot that's it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.800 
than just to have it look hot that's it
it's<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.150> static<00:03:09.670> most<00:03:10.670> manufacturers<00:03:11.269> use<00:03:11.630> an

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
it's a static most manufacturers use an

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.190 
it's a static most manufacturers use an
all-in-one<00:03:12.230> little<00:03:12.680> cooling<00:03:12.830> system<00:03:13.130> okay

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
all-in-one little cooling system okay

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.780 
all-in-one little cooling system okay
they're<00:03:15.200> very<00:03:15.530> reliable<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.280> system<00:03:16.550> here<00:03:16.700> is

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
they're very reliable the system here is

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.150 
they're very reliable the system here is
actually<00:03:17.060> empty<00:03:17.180> but<00:03:17.959> it's<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.320> extra<00:03:19.040> large

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
actually empty but it's a extra large

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.100 
actually empty but it's a extra large
reservoir<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:19.910> that's<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.269> like<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> big<00:03:20.870> old

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
reservoir and that's just like a big old

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.500 
reservoir and that's just like a big old
bong<00:03:21.739> in<00:03:22.070> your<00:03:22.220> computer<00:03:24.760> that's<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:26.209> wonder

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
bong in your computer that's I wonder

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.920 
bong in your computer that's I wonder
who<00:03:26.600> came<00:03:26.750> up<00:03:26.870> with<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.079> idea<00:03:27.549> now<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.720> what

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
who came up with that idea now so what

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.720 
who came up with that idea now so what
are<00:03:29.959> we<00:03:30.079> dealing<00:03:30.410> with<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:30.709> terms<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:31.100> cost<00:03:31.430> for

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
are we dealing with in terms of cost for

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.699 
are we dealing with in terms of cost for
this<00:03:31.910> guy<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:32.299> how<00:03:32.420> much<00:03:32.540> does<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.959> one<00:03:33.170> in

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
this guy like how much does this one in
