 make sure it's not hidden or 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.079
 Asleep somewhere, warn your 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.060
 neighbors and tries to form a chain with 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.110
 neighborhood children who play in the 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.260

 Orient yourself to leave it at your door 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.520
 home you can leave other clues 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.220
 painful as small piles of sand 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.040
 your sandbox around the house 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.340
 you have to do daily tours of 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 the area calling and carrying a tin 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.049
 olorosa to bring it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.530
 you can do it late at night or 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.050
 well early in the morning so that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.180
 there is less noise and is encouraged to leave 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:28.440
 posters are very important 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.920
 posters they must contain the 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.560
 next eye information that in the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.810
 trouble and in despair that one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.170
 have you can forget about data 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.120
 important the data that should contain 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:50.610
 are the following name of the cat photo 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.280
 color description even if there is a photo 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.140
 since you probably print them in 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.620
 black and white 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 the day you missed where you were 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.950
 lost contact phone you have to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.200
 make sure you put a phone where 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.230
 there is always someone email 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.110
 maybe a reward is not mandatory 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.150
 offer it but even if it's small 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.930
 always incentive 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.980
 paste the posters at the vets 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.129
 in the local commercial pet shops 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.670
 bus stops of micros poles where you 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.959
 happen to wear transparent tape of the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.959
 thick so the posters last longer 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.420
 pull the posters below the door 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.290
 of the neighbors of your block and of the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.230
 nearby blocks call the clinics 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.019
 veterinarians in your area may be 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.440
 someone has picked it up and taken it to a 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.440
 veterinary 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:07.160
 prevention is first and fundamental 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.530
 sterilize your pet 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.680
 second if I allowed him to go outside 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.810
 uses an elastic necklace with 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.819
 identification of metal badges 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.610
 engraved bottles where you can 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.360
 save a paper with the address are 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.849
 some species of barrel or 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.319
 just embroider or write something 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.209
 permanently on the necklace there 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:45.440
 Indelible markers always keep 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:49.489
 updated the third data if the cat 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.730
 recently arrived at that dwelling not what 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:57.650
 let out for a good minimum time 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.989
 but at least two weeks and then you have 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.140
 that make know the surroundings in 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.140
 Supervised exits do not worry 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.020
 and finally have an updated photo 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.010
 of your cat where it looks good on its own 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.010
 you get to lose 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:28.020
 and do not lose hope the cats will 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.960
 they orientate well and many times they return 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.460
 alone that there is someone at home to 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:39.020
 receive it or fundamentally leave something 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.020
 open so you can enter
