 what do you have to do? 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.280
 This video here on the internet is very 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.280
 hard to find 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.620

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.590

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.470
 look expect 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.190
 remembering and focusing on the original English 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.190
 For my Portuguese father, you have to 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.650
 chip and pin the settings to 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.850
 tomato that will automatically update 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:37.800
 to the Portuguese version, creating 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:42.000
 direct to order creating here the final 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.509
 nationals are checking is almost 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.509

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.920

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.940
 element and this cell phone it 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.000
 costume 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.970
 Then you can not put the scene there. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.940
 a united master does not do what he 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.980

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.360

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:33.920
 the chip I do not do here is 100% already 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.850

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:43.040
 Catch but he caught a chip so did not 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:46.070

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:04.490
 to say this here but it was the people already 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:07.160
