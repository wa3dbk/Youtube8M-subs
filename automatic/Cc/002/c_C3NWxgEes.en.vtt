 being a great city ​​Monterrey is 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.830
 faces the problems that affect 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.080
 all the big cities sometimes it's 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.690
 a valley without preparing others a traffic light 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.049
 decomposed or even a crime that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.939
 nobody reports to this situation the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 public servants face a 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.409
 a lot of problems that do not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.149
 they can always get to solve is 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.640
 common that we think that our voice does not 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.649
 will be heard and apathy will win us 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.319
 since we do not know what the 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.300
 means to participate the servers 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.190
 public also observe many 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.230
 needs but they do not have their 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 provision of reliable spaces for

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 lack of credibility on the part of the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.410

 as public servants are 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.580
 frustrated because although they have the 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.400
 intention to generate a change that 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.520
