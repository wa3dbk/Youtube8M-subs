00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
hello and welcome to gold buzzer in my

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.340 
hello and welcome to gold buzzer in my
last<00:00:15.450> video<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.230> said<00:00:16.890> go<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.850> gold<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.480> I

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
last video I said go for gold and I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.470 
last video I said go for gold and I
think<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.920> video<00:00:20.340> has<00:00:20.520> been<00:00:20.730> pretty<00:00:21.150> well

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
think that video has been pretty well

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.599 
think that video has been pretty well

received add some interesting comment

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.820 
received add some interesting comment
one<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.910> particular<00:00:27.300> from<00:00:28.140> eyes<00:00:28.980> wide<00:00:29.849> open

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
one in particular from eyes wide open

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.650 
one in particular from eyes wide open
Nimrod<00:00:31.830> he<00:00:32.790> said<00:00:33.770> also<00:00:34.770> look<00:00:35.040> at<00:00:35.309> silver<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
Nimrod he said also look at silver as it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.250 
Nimrod he said also look at silver as it
is<00:00:36.780> 64<00:00:37.410> 21<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> moment<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.840> normal

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
is 64 21 at the moment but it's normal

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.720 
is 64 21 at the moment but it's normal
ratio<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:41.070> 17<00:00:41.820> 21<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.469> must<00:00:43.800> go<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.340> four

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
ratio is 17 21 so it must go up four

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
ratio is 17 21 so it must go up four
times<00:00:45.030> its<00:00:45.510> current<00:00:45.899> price<00:00:46.379> before<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.010> get

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
times its current price before it's get

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.930 
times its current price before it's get
to<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.489> true<00:00:47.850> position<00:00:48.090> relative<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.870> gold<00:00:49.940> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
to is true position relative to gold so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.709 
to is true position relative to gold so
then<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.480> gold<00:00:51.809> goes<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.719> but

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
then if gold goes up it will go up but

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.049 
then if gold goes up it will go up but
basically<00:00:55.079> gold<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.160> silver<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> good<00:00:57.329> buy<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
basically gold or silver is a good buy I

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.869 
basically gold or silver is a good buy I
pretty<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.239> agree<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.520> therefore<00:01:02.520> i

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
pretty much agree with that therefore i

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.010 
pretty much agree with that therefore i

this is my video about gold silver ratio
the<00:01:17.490> gold<00:01:17.820> silver<00:01:18.810> ratio<00:01:19.439> indicates<00:01:20.659> all<00:01:21.659> many

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the gold silver ratio indicates all many

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.249 
the gold silver ratio indicates all many
similar<00:01:23.189> houses<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.979> one

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
similar houses you can get for one

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.010

probably know today's similar price is
around<00:02:21.939> eighteen<00:02:22.870> dollars<00:02:23.230> per<00:02:23.890> ounce<00:02:24.159> so<00:02:25.000> yes

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
around eighteen dollars per ounce so yes

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.630

two hundred dollars parents were
surprised<00:02:33.629> we<00:02:34.629> left<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.200> rise<00:02:35.459> four<00:02:36.459> times<00:02:36.909> for

the<00:02:37.900> historic<00:02:38.769> gold<00:02:39.400> silver<00:02:39.939> ratio<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:41.019> be

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
the historic gold silver ratio to be

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.589 
the historic gold silver ratio to be
re-established<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.590> am<00:02:45.370> pretty<00:02:45.400> sure<00:02:46.030> that

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
re-established but I am pretty sure that

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.559 
re-established but I am pretty sure that
the<00:02:47.079> gold<00:02:47.409> price<00:02:47.680> will<00:02:48.159> go<00:02:48.190> much<00:02:48.730> higher<00:02:48.760> than

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
the gold price will go much higher than

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.869 
the gold price will go much higher than
one<00:02:50.170> thousand<00:02:50.650> two<00:02:50.799> hundred<00:02:50.950> dollars<00:02:51.579> per

one thousand two hundred dollars per

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.979 
one thousand two hundred dollars per

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
ounce therefore the potential for a
