Yeti this one just takes her one step
further<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.210> audio<00:00:15.509> quality<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.170> comes

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
further the audio quality that comes

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.740 
further the audio quality that comes
from<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.680> thing<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.150> absolutely<00:00:18.150> sublime<00:00:18.330> I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
from this thing is absolutely sublime I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.359 
from this thing is absolutely sublime I
would<00:00:18.960> highly<00:00:19.320> suggest<00:00:19.350> watching<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.130> video

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
would highly suggest watching this video

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.609 
would highly suggest watching this video
in<00:00:20.609> 1080p<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> full

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
in 1080p so that you can get the full

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.910 
in 1080p so that you can get the full
quality<00:00:23.689> now<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.869> far<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.320> microphone<00:00:25.650> is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
quality now as far as the microphone is

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.800 
quality now as far as the microphone is
concerned<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.609> studio<00:00:27.119> cardioid

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
concerned it is a studio cardioid

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.509 
concerned it is a studio cardioid
microphone<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.680> means<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> picks<00:00:29.369> up

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
microphone this means that it picks up

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640 
microphone this means that it picks up
sound<00:00:29.789> from<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.179> front<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.900> studio<00:00:31.289> part

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
sound from the front the studio part

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
sound from the front the studio part
means<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.160> has<00:00:32.279> an<00:00:32.489> XLR<00:00:32.969> output<00:00:33.450> which

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
means that it has an XLR output which

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
means that it has an XLR output which
means<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> run<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> into<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.340> XLR

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
means that I have to run it into an XLR

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.270 
means that I have to run it into an XLR
to<00:00:35.969> USB<00:00:36.210> converter<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.620> goes<00:00:37.829> into<00:00:38.160> my

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to USB converter which then goes into my

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.729 
to USB converter which then goes into my
PC<00:00:38.760> when<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> buy<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.870> thing<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.350> comes<00:00:40.590> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
PC when you buy this thing what comes in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
PC when you buy this thing what comes in
the<00:00:40.770> box<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.219> obviously<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> microphone<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the box is obviously the microphone a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
the box is obviously the microphone a
shock<00:00:43.050> mount<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> pop<00:00:44.430> filter<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
shock mount and also a pop filter and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
shock mount and also a pop filter and
one<00:00:45.059> thing<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.600> say<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
one thing that I will say is that the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
one thing that I will say is that the
pop<00:00:46.860> filter<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.280> comes<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.820> thing

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
pop filter that comes with this thing

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
pop filter that comes with this thing
isn't<00:00:48.270> particularly<00:00:48.870> good<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.350> mean<00:00:49.770> it's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
isn't particularly good I mean it's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.709 
isn't particularly good I mean it's
lovely<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.460> blue<00:00:50.700> throw<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> it

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
lovely the blue throw it in and it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.240 
lovely the blue throw it in and it
really<00:00:52.020> does<00:00:52.230> look<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> microphone

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
really does look good on the microphone

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
really does look good on the microphone
but<00:00:53.489> unfortunately<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.899> doesn't<00:00:55.199> work

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
but unfortunately it just doesn't work

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
but unfortunately it just doesn't work
particularly<00:00:55.800> well<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.430> would<00:00:56.699> suggest

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
particularly well so I would suggest

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
particularly well so I would suggest
picking<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.570> aftermarket<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:59.250> one

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
picking up and aftermarket one but one

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
picking up and aftermarket one but one
thing<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.059> strikes<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
thing that really strikes me about this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500
