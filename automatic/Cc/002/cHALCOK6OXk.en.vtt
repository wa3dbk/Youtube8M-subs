00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
I said about NYX eyeshadow base it shows

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.240 
I said about NYX eyeshadow base it shows
color<00:04:07.769> very<00:04:08.099> well<00:04:08.629> but<00:04:09.629> it<00:04:09.870> creases<00:04:10.250> badly

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
color very well but it creases badly

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.400 
color very well but it creases badly
after<00:04:11.489> hour<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:13.849> it<00:04:14.849> would<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.060> safe<00:04:15.689> to<00:04:15.720> use

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
after hour and it would be safe to use

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.719 
after hour and it would be safe to use
the<00:04:16.829> eye<00:04:16.859> primer<00:04:18.769> but<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.160> reason<00:04:20.370> why<00:04:20.609> I'm

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
the eye primer but the reason why I'm

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.189 
the eye primer but the reason why I'm
using<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.419> because<00:04:21.780> i'm<00:04:21.900> going<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.079> show

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199
