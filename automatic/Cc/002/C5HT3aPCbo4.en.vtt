00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220 

problem<00:00:00.329> we're<00:00:00.570> looking<00:00:00.840> at<00:00:01.020> the

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
problem we're looking at the

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.010 
problem we're looking at the
relationship<00:00:02.010> between<00:00:02.629> kilograms<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.840> and

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
relationship between kilograms and and

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.519 
relationship between kilograms and and
grams<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.460> thing<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.700> need<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.910> know<00:00:06.000> is

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
grams and one thing we need to know is

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.720 
grams and one thing we need to know is
what

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.820 

in<00:00:11.389> kilo<00:00:11.870> means<00:00:12.080> out<00:00:12.580> then<00:00:13.990> we<00:00:14.990> have<00:00:15.080> a<00:00:15.110> kilo

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
in kilo means out then we have a kilo

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.679 
in kilo means out then we have a kilo
gram<00:00:16.189> oops<00:00:16.930> that<00:00:17.930> means<00:00:18.109> we<00:00:18.259> have<00:00:19.210> 1,000<00:00:20.210> grams

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
gram oops that means we have 1,000 grams

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.749 
gram oops that means we have 1,000 grams
through<00:00:21.380> this<00:00:21.529> happening<00:00:22.180> so<00:00:23.180> kilo<00:00:23.660> equals

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
through this happening so kilo equals

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.460 
through this happening so kilo equals
1,000<00:00:25.759> it's<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:25.970> prefix<00:00:26.449> anytime<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:26.960> see<00:00:27.109> kilo

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
1,000 it's a prefix anytime you see kilo

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.409 
1,000 it's a prefix anytime you see kilo
and<00:00:27.920> means<00:00:28.449> 1,000<00:00:29.529> whereas<00:00:30.529> Millie<00:00:31.130> means<00:00:31.939> one

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
and means 1,000 whereas Millie means one

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.350 
and means 1,000 whereas Millie means one
one-thousandth<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:33.830> kilo<00:00:34.580> means<00:00:34.760> a<00:00:34.940> thousand

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
one-thousandth so kilo means a thousand

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.819 
one-thousandth so kilo means a thousand
times<00:00:35.449> bigger<00:00:35.839> than<00:00:35.960> some<00:00:36.290> things<00:00:36.530> if<00:00:36.680> we<00:00:36.739> have

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
times bigger than some things if we have

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.649 
times bigger than some things if we have
a<00:00:36.920> kilogram<00:00:38.920> what<00:00:39.920> this<00:00:40.100> means<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:40.659> 1,000

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
a kilogram what this means is 1,000

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.180 
a kilogram what this means is 1,000
grams<00:00:42.100> so<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.219> ratio<00:00:43.430> here<00:00:44.030> is<00:00:44.180> 1<00:00:44.989> kg<00:00:45.649> and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
grams so the ratio here is 1 kg and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.360 
grams so the ratio here is 1 kg and
that's<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.730> abbreviation<00:00:47.390> for<00:00:47.420> kilogram<00:00:48.370> for

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
that's the abbreviation for kilogram for

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.920 
that's the abbreviation for kilogram for
every<00:00:49.550> 1<00:00:49.699> kilogram<00:00:50.090> we<00:00:50.570> have<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:51.079> have<00:00:51.309> 1000<00:00:52.930> so

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
every 1 kilogram we have we have 1000 so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.080 
every 1 kilogram we have we have 1000 so
really<00:00:54.199> this<00:00:54.440> problem<00:00:54.920> even<00:00:55.579> look<00:00:55.820> there's<00:00:56.030> a

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
really this problem even look there's a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.209 
really this problem even look there's a
lot<00:00:56.239> going<00:00:56.269> on<00:00:56.600> here<00:00:56.660> really<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:57.320> goes<00:00:57.469> down<00:00:58.010> to

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
lot going on here really it goes down to

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.490 
lot going on here really it goes down to
this<00:00:58.460> ratio<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.269> exactly<00:00:59.930> when<00:01:00.109> we<00:01:00.320> ran

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
this ratio and exactly when we ran

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.880 
this ratio and exactly when we ran
outside<00:01:01.090> 1,000<00:01:02.090> grams<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:03.440> let's<00:01:03.620> read<00:01:03.769> the

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
outside 1,000 grams so let's read the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.550 
outside 1,000 grams so let's read the
problem<00:01:04.309> sunshine<00:01:05.089> airline<00:01:05.570> requires<00:01:06.110> each

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
problem sunshine airline requires each

bring her suitcase on to the plane ok so
in<00:01:37.220> other<00:01:37.640> words<00:01:37.910> her<00:01:38.569> circus<00:01:38.959> to<00:01:39.200> case<00:01:39.410> weighs

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
in other words her circus to case weighs

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.460 
in other words her circus to case weighs
three<00:01:40.970> thousand<00:01:41.420> six<00:01:41.630> hundred<00:01:41.690> twenty<00:01:42.229> grams

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
three thousand six hundred twenty grams

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.210 
three thousand six hundred twenty grams
but<00:01:43.340> she's<00:01:43.580> allowed<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:43.940> have<00:01:44.679> her<00:01:45.679> suitcase

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
but she's allowed to have her suitcase

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.859 
but she's allowed to have her suitcase
way<00:01:46.429> up<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:47.200> through<00:01:48.369> 31.75<00:01:49.369> kilograms<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.720> it

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
way up to through 31.75 kilograms so it

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.529 
way up to through 31.75 kilograms so it
can<00:01:50.989> be<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.110> lot<00:01:51.259> heavier<00:01:51.440> how<00:01:52.399> much<00:01:52.759> more

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
can be a lot heavier how much more

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.540 
can be a lot heavier how much more
weight<00:01:54.020> could<00:01:54.379> she<00:01:54.500> pack<00:01:54.709> it<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.039> her<00:01:55.129> suitcase

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
weight could she pack it to her suitcase

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.550 
weight could she pack it to her suitcase
so<00:01:56.270> what<00:01:56.509> I'm<00:01:56.599> going<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.840> do<00:01:56.989> first<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.410> all

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
so what I'm going to do first of all

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.830 
so what I'm going to do first of all
since<00:01:57.950> we're<00:01:58.190> looking<00:01:58.580> at<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:59.149> weight<00:01:59.629> in

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
since we're looking at the weight in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.809 
since we're looking at the weight in
kilograms<00:02:00.099> I'm<00:02:01.099> going<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.340> change<00:02:01.640> everything

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
kilograms I'm going to change everything

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.960 
kilograms I'm going to change everything
in<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.360> problem<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.619> mutants<00:02:04.039> so<00:02:04.640> only

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
in this problem to that mutants so only

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.809 
in this problem to that mutants so only
dealing<00:02:05.660> with<00:02:05.810> kilograms<00:02:06.459> so<00:02:07.459> we're<00:02:07.610> going<00:02:07.729> to

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
dealing with kilograms so we're going to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.699 
dealing with kilograms so we're going to
use<00:02:07.940> this<00:02:08.090> ratio<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.090> three<00:02:11.709> thousand

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
use this ratio so we have three thousand

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.330 
use this ratio so we have three thousand
six<00:02:13.520> hundred<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.000> twenty<00:02:14.530> grams

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
six hundred and twenty grams

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.290 
six hundred and twenty grams
that's<00:02:17.060> how<00:02:17.239> much<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.599> in<00:02:17.690> her<00:02:17.810> suitcase<00:02:18.019> and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
that's how much is in her suitcase and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.780 
that's how much is in her suitcase and
we<00:02:20.300> know<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.510> every<00:02:21.170> 1,000<00:02:21.920> grams<00:02:22.250> has<00:02:22.610> one

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
we know that every 1,000 grams has one

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.640 
we know that every 1,000 grams has one
kilogram<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:24.050> figure<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.410> number<00:02:24.500> of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
kilogram so to figure out the number of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.199 
kilogram so to figure out the number of
kilograms<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.340> we're<00:02:25.519> going<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.730> say<00:02:25.940> well

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
kilograms here we're going to say well

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.000 
kilograms here we're going to say well
what<00:02:27.019> does<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.349> multiply<00:02:27.950> 1000<00:02:28.670> by<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.819> get<00:02:30.010> 3620

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
what does a multiply 1000 by to get 3620

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.780 
what does a multiply 1000 by to get 3620
and<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.730> answer<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.319> 3.6<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.590> if<00:02:33.799> we<00:02:34.640> don't

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
and the answer is 3.6 to if we don't

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.320 
and the answer is 3.6 to if we don't
know<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.360> could<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.629> take<00:02:37.090> 3620<00:02:38.090> and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
know that we could just take 3620 and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.979 
know that we could just take 3620 and
divide<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.720> by<00:02:39.340> 1000<00:02:40.340> which<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.580> easy<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:41.000> do<00:02:41.330> is

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
divide it by 1000 which is easy to do is

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.050 
divide it by 1000 which is easy to do is
every<00:02:42.319> time<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.560> divide<00:02:42.830> by<00:02:43.010> 10<00:02:43.310> move<00:02:43.940> your

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
every time we divide by 10 move your

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.509 
every time we divide by 10 move your
decimal<00:02:44.269> point<00:02:44.599> one<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.410> left<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.340> here

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
decimal point one to the left so here

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.300 
decimal point one to the left so here
we're<00:02:46.670> moving<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.209> left<00:02:47.239> three<00:02:47.690> times<00:02:48.310> and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
we're moving to the left three times and

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.600 
we're moving to the left three times and
that's<00:02:49.660> 3.62<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.319> here<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.709> multiplying<00:02:52.430> by

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
that's 3.62 so here the multiplying by

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.670 
that's 3.62 so here the multiplying by
3.62<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.079> we're<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.410> keep<00:02:54.530> that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
3.62 and we're going to keep that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.339 
3.62 and we're going to keep that
balanced<00:02:55.220> here<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.090> means<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.920> 3.6

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
balanced here so that means that 3.6

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.940 
balanced here so that means that 3.6
23.62<00:03:00.349> kilograms<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> same<00:03:01.670> thing<00:03:01.700> as

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
23.62 kilograms is the same thing as

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.190 
23.62 kilograms is the same thing as
3620<00:03:03.950> grams<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:06.560> means<00:03:06.829> her<00:03:07.040> suitcase

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
3620 grams so that means her suitcase

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.270 
3620 grams so that means her suitcase
weighs<00:03:12.879> 3.62<00:03:13.879> kilograms<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.560> wait<00:03:15.739> she<00:03:16.099> can

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
weighs 3.62 kilograms but wait she can

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.920 
weighs 3.62 kilograms but wait she can
pack<00:03:16.549> up<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.209> 30<00:03:18.519> 1.75<00:03:19.519> kilograms<00:03:20.209> right<00:03:20.600> and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
pack up to 30 1.75 kilograms right and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.140 
pack up to 30 1.75 kilograms right and
that's<00:03:21.049> thirty<00:03:21.319> one<00:03:21.560> thousand<00:03:22.190> seven<00:03:22.700> hundred

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
that's thirty one thousand seven hundred

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.140 
that's thirty one thousand seven hundred
and<00:03:23.359> fifty<00:03:23.690> grams<00:03:24.049> so<00:03:24.980> we<00:03:25.730> weren't<00:03:25.850> know<00:03:26.000> in

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
and fifty grams so we weren't know in

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.059 
and fifty grams so we weren't know in
kilograms<00:03:26.569> how<00:03:26.780> much<00:03:26.930> more<00:03:27.109> could<00:03:27.230> she<00:03:27.380> add<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
kilograms how much more could she add to

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.520 
kilograms how much more could she add to
do<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.459> i'm<00:03:28.639> going<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.970> subtract<00:03:30.970> 3.62<00:03:32.530> from

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
do that i'm going to subtract 3.62 from

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.960 
do that i'm going to subtract 3.62 from
the<00:03:33.650> total<00:03:33.950> amount<00:03:34.040> right<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.579> want<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.849> know

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the total amount right I want to know

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.089 
the total amount right I want to know
how<00:03:35.209> much<00:03:35.359> is<00:03:35.540> left<00:03:35.569> I've<00:03:36.440> asked<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.889> tell

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
how much is left I've asked you to tell

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.129 
how much is left I've asked you to tell
me<00:03:37.130> how<00:03:37.340> much<00:03:37.430> more<00:03:37.700> she<00:03:37.849> can<00:03:38.000> pack<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.870> this<00:03:39.019> is

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
me how much more she can pack so this is

a part 2 question on new york state
tests<00:03:41.269> we<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:41.900> use<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.019> calculator<00:03:42.290> here<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:42.709> we

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
tests we can use a calculator here if we

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.250 
tests we can use a calculator here if we
want<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.069> i'm<00:03:43.370> going<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.950> 31.75<00:03:46.329> minus<00:03:47.329> 3.6<00:03:47.989> 2

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
want to i'm going to 31.75 minus 3.6 2

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.949 
want to i'm going to 31.75 minus 3.6 2
i'm<00:03:49.040> getting<00:03:50.290> 28.1<00:03:51.290> three<00:03:51.950> kilograms<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
i'm getting 28.1 three kilograms and

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.539 
i'm getting 28.1 three kilograms and
generally<00:03:53.959> what<00:03:54.079> i<00:03:54.109> do<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.620> especially<00:03:55.459> over

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
generally what i do is especially over

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.520 
generally what i do is especially over
using<00:03:55.700> calculator<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.329> i<00:03:56.480> do<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.870> step<00:03:57.139> twice

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
using calculator is i do that step twice

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.150 
using calculator is i do that step twice
so<00:03:58.480> 31.75<00:03:59.480> minus<00:04:00.790> 3.6<00:04:01.790> too<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.269> i<00:04:02.419> get<00:04:03.160> 28.1

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
so 31.75 minus 3.6 too and i get 28.1

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.809 
so 31.75 minus 3.6 too and i get 28.1
three<00:04:04.669> so<00:04:05.180> she<00:04:05.239> could<00:04:05.540> pack<00:04:06.099> 28.1<00:04:07.099> three<00:04:07.489> more

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
three so she could pack 28.1 three more

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.059 
three so she could pack 28.1 three more
kilograms<00:04:08.419> in<00:04:08.540> her<00:04:08.630> suitcase<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.260> still<00:04:09.919> be

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
kilograms in her suitcase and still be

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.440 
kilograms in her suitcase and still be
allowed<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.370> bring<00:04:10.519> her<00:04:10.669> suitcase<00:04:10.970> onto<00:04:11.329> the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
allowed to bring her suitcase onto the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.220 
allowed to bring her suitcase onto the
plane<00:04:11.709> alright<00:04:12.709> hope<00:04:12.859> that<00:04:12.980> helps
