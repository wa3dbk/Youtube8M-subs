our<00:01:30.810> discharge<00:01:31.380> pipe<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.310> into

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
our discharge pipe right up here into

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
our discharge pipe right up here into
the<00:01:32.759> stand<00:01:33.030> pipe<00:01:33.299> alright<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.990> always<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the stand pipe alright it's always a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
the stand pipe alright it's always a
good<00:01:34.470> idea<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.799> secure<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.369> discharge<00:01:35.640> pipe

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
good idea to secure that discharge pipe

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
good idea to secure that discharge pipe
so<00:01:36.450> I'll<00:01:36.540> throw<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> cable<00:01:37.229> tie<00:01:37.409> right<00:01:37.619> around

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so I'll throw the cable tie right around

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.770 
so I'll throw the cable tie right around
there<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.840> snug<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:41.420> now<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.600> time<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
there just snug it up now it's time to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.560 
there just snug it up now it's time to
connect<00:01:43.110> our<00:01:43.229> dryer<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.240> couple

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
connect our dryer now we have a couple

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
connect our dryer now we have a couple
of<00:01:45.630> connections<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.110> make<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> back<00:01:46.710> one

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
of connections to make on the back one

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
of connections to make on the back one
is<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> gas<00:01:47.790> supply<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> gas<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is the gas supply that's the gas is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780 
is the gas supply that's the gas is
going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.740> burned<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> dry<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> clothes

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
going to be burned to dry the clothes

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.819 
going to be burned to dry the clothes
and<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> flu<00:01:52.110> products<00:01:52.530> from

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and this is the flu products from

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.280 
and this is the flu products from
combustion<00:01:53.369> has<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.939> outside<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.200> we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
combustion has to get to outside and we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.630 
combustion has to get to outside and we
have<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.710> from<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.070> point<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> gas

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
have to go from this point the gas

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
have to go from this point the gas

right<00:01:59.310> here<00:01:59.490> you've<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> shutoff<00:02:00.240> valve

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
right here you've got a shutoff valve

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.170 
right here you've got a shutoff valve
from<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.869> old<00:02:01.200> dryer<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:03.030> I'm

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
from the old dryer that was here now I'm

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
from the old dryer that was here now I'm
using<00:02:03.479> black<00:02:03.869> steel<00:02:04.290> pipe<00:02:04.649> now<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> old

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
using black steel pipe now in the old

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
using black steel pipe now in the old
days<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.969> used<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.149> cut<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.630> thread<00:02:06.810> every

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
days we used to cut and thread every

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.119 
days we used to cut and thread every
single<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.469> these<00:02:07.590> pieces<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.950> pipe

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
single one of these pieces of pipe

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.160 
single one of these pieces of pipe
nowadays<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.300> get<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.660> pre-made

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
nowadays you can get them in pre-made

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.860 
nowadays you can get them in pre-made
lengths<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.770> half-inch<00:02:11.760> increments<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.660> 10

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
lengths in half-inch increments up to 10

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.649 
lengths in half-inch increments up to 10
feet

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
feet

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.589 
feet
so<00:02:14.109> what<00:02:14.230> I've<00:02:14.319> done<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.590> drive<00:02:15.099> v<00:02:15.519> this<00:02:16.209> steel

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
so what I've done is drive v this steel

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.839 
so what I've done is drive v this steel
piping<00:02:17.079> so<00:02:17.650> from<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.129> point<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.700> gas

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
piping so from this point the gas

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.670 
piping so from this point the gas
shutoff<00:02:19.180> want<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.989> come<00:02:20.140> with<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.439> steel

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
shutoff want to come with this steel

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.740 
shutoff want to come with this steel
pipe<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> come<00:02:22.329> right<00:02:22.510> down

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
pipe and it's going to come right down

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.539 
pipe and it's going to come right down
to<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.140> bottom<00:02:23.500> right<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.310> we<00:02:24.459> are
