00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
probably just throw this over my lid and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.840 
probably just throw this over my lid and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
far as smudge ability is that a word um

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.000 
far as smudge ability is that a word um
you<00:02:32.160> can't<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.209> know<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.830> could

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
you can't really you know you could

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.680 
you can't really you know you could
probably<00:02:35.250> smudge<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.060> within<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.360> first

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
probably smudge it within the first

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.839 
probably smudge it within the first
second<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.260> laying<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.709> down<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.489> have<00:02:38.730> to

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
second of laying it down so you have to

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.910 
second of laying it down so you have to
be<00:02:38.970> really<00:02:39.269> quick<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.840> should<00:02:40.019> probably<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
be really quick it should probably it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.069 
be really quick it should probably it
should<00:02:41.220> probably<00:02:41.670> say<00:02:41.909> like<00:02:42.150> 12<00:02:42.450> hour<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.049> even

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
should probably say like 12 hour or even

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.069 
should probably say like 12 hour or even
24<00:02:43.799> hour<00:02:43.950> because<00:02:44.459> even<00:02:45.390> when<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:45.629> removing

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
24 hour because even when I'm removing

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.259 
24 hour because even when I'm removing
this<00:02:46.349> with<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.860> eye<00:02:46.890> makeup<00:02:47.400> remover<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
this with my eye makeup remover it's a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:03:02.479 
this with my eye makeup remover it's a
little<00:02:48.480> bit<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.720> task<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.290> think<00:03:01.709> it's

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
little bit of a task but I think it's

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.430 
little bit of a task but I think it's
worth<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.940> for<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.480> know<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.810> longevity<00:03:04.019> that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
worth it for you know the longevity that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.650 
worth it for you know the longevity that
it<00:03:04.859> gives<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.519> it's<00:03:05.910> very<00:03:06.150> clean<00:03:06.420> me<00:03:06.540> when

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
it gives you and it's very clean me when

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:15.770 
it gives you and it's very clean me when
it<00:03:06.780> goes<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.430> it's<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.579> lot<00:03:08.730> like<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:14.569> want<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.690> say

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
it goes on it's a lot like I want to say

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.330 
it goes on it's a lot like I want to say
the<00:03:15.930> creaminess<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.650> like<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.010> Milani

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the creaminess is like the Milani

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.509 
the creaminess is like the Milani
liquefies<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.450> even<00:03:19.349> possibly<00:03:20.069> even<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
liquefies and even possibly even the

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.550 
liquefies and even possibly even the
Urban<00:03:20.819> Decay<00:03:20.849> liners<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.690> goes<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.019> as<00:03:22.260> creamy

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
Urban Decay liners it goes on as creamy

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.550 
Urban Decay liners it goes on as creamy
as<00:03:22.680> those<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.849> these<00:03:24.150> really<00:03:24.660> they<00:03:25.230> stick

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
as those but these really they stick

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.080 
as those but these really they stick
they<00:03:25.950> don't<00:03:26.160> go<00:03:26.310> anywhere<00:03:26.519> they<00:03:26.730> don't<00:03:26.880> budge

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
they don't go anywhere they don't budge

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.430 
they don't go anywhere they don't budge
i<00:03:27.239> think<00:03:27.450> those<00:03:27.630> liners<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.139> can<00:03:28.290> actually

i think those liners you can actually

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.740 
i think those liners you can actually
smudge<00:03:28.889> out<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.130> little<00:03:29.340> bit<00:03:29.579> these<00:03:30.299> not<00:03:30.540> so
