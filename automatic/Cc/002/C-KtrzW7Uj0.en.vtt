with<00:01:58.060> speed<00:01:58.479> Cola<00:01:58.750> oh<00:01:59.050> yeah<00:02:00.040> definitely<00:02:00.550> I

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
with speed Cola oh yeah definitely I

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.490 
with speed Cola oh yeah definitely I
haven't<00:02:01.240> found<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.659> be<00:02:01.720> cool<00:02:01.900> if<00:02:02.049> it's<00:02:02.260> on<00:02:02.409> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
haven't found to be cool if it's on the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.310 
haven't found to be cool if it's on the
map<00:02:02.620> yet<00:02:02.830> but<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.490> definitely<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.510> it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
map yet but I definitely think that it

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.219 
map yet but I definitely think that it
would<00:02:05.470> be<00:02:05.620> worth<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.850> hassle<00:02:07.000> just<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.080> buy

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
would be worth the hassle just to buy

would be worth the hassle just to buy
