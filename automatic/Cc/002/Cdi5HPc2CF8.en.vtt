00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
think it's kind of hard to tell but it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.700 
think it's kind of hard to tell but it
swims<00:03:37.460> in<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.640> water<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.930> has<00:03:39.080> gills<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
swims in the water and it has gills and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.770 
swims in the water and it has gills and
it's<00:03:39.890> blue<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.520> angry<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.600> eats

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
it's blue and it's angry and it eats

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.470 
it's blue and it's angry and it eats
things<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> like<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.760> already<00:03:43.880> probably

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480

we have coil Reapers stormtrooper this
is<00:04:59.060> actually<00:04:59.390> his<00:04:59.510> enhanced<00:04:59.840> version<00:05:00.260> because

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
is actually his enhanced version because

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.810 
is actually his enhanced version because

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
he made a previous version but I don't

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.220 
he made a previous version but I don't
think<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.000> one<00:05:02.240> was<00:05:02.419> nearly<00:05:02.750> as<00:05:02.930> good<00:05:03.080> as

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
think that one was nearly as good as

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.050 
think that one was nearly as good as
this<00:05:03.380> one<00:05:03.590> because<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.250> one<00:05:04.430> first<00:05:04.820> off

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
this one because that one first off

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.170 
this one because that one first off
didn't<00:05:05.360> have<00:05:05.480> gloves<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:06.890> this<00:05:07.880> one<00:05:08.060> has<00:05:08.150> a

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
didn't have gloves and this one has a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.070 
didn't have gloves and this one has a
much<00:05:08.390> cooler<00:05:08.630> blaster<00:05:09.169> so<00:05:09.500> go<00:05:09.620> for<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:09.890> one

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
much cooler blaster so go for this one

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.260 
much cooler blaster so go for this one
next<00:05:12.080> week<00:05:12.230> well<00:05:12.470> Reapers<00:05:12.800> atst<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.910> go<00:05:14.060> along

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.310 
next week well Reapers atst to go along
with<00:05:14.450> that<00:05:14.480> so<00:05:14.840> if<00:05:14.930> you<00:05:15.020> want<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.200> be<00:05:15.290> a

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
with that so if you want to be a

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.500 
with that so if you want to be a
stormtrooper<00:05:15.880> riding<00:05:16.880> along<00:05:17.120> on<00:05:17.240> an<00:05:17.360> eight

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
stormtrooper riding along on an eight

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.770 
stormtrooper riding along on an eight
EST<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.520> I<00:05:19.520> think<00:05:19.640> this<00:05:19.940> replaces<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.600> play

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
EST and I think this replaces the play

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.110 
EST and I think this replaces the play
runner<00:05:21.020> yeah<00:05:21.350> it<00:05:21.410> does<00:05:21.620> so<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.880> can<00:05:23.000> run

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
runner yeah it does so you can run

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.620 
runner yeah it does so you can run
around<00:05:23.270> in<00:05:23.450> your<00:05:23.480> own<00:05:23.600> little<00:05:24.020> mini<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.410> TST

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
around in your own little mini a TST

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.520 
around in your own little mini a TST
unfortunately<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.690> can't<00:05:26.900> fire<00:05:27.080> lasers<00:05:27.410> at

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
unfortunately you can't fire lasers at

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.710 
unfortunately you can't fire lasers at
people<00:05:27.830> but<00:05:28.070> that<00:05:28.820> would<00:05:28.940> be<00:05:28.970> a<00:05:29.060> cool<00:05:29.270> mod<00:05:29.480> if

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
people but that would be a cool mod if

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.779 
people but that would be a cool mod if
that<00:05:30.050> if<00:05:30.350> somehow<00:05:31.070> that<00:05:31.220> was<00:05:31.430> made<00:05:31.580> possible

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
that if somehow that was made possible

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.150 
that if somehow that was made possible
