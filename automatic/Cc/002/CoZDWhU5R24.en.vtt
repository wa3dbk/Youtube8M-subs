halfway through Toys cember and this
time<00:00:08.110> we're<00:00:08.620> going<00:00:08.770> to<00:00:08.860> talk<00:00:09.070> about<00:00:09.100> a<00:00:09.400> rather

this<00:00:14.049> bumblebee<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:16.330> you<00:00:16.810> might<00:00:17.140> think

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
this bumblebee but you might think

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.560 
this bumblebee but you might think
that's<00:00:17.680> just<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.070> gravity<00:00:18.580> bot<00:00:18.850> we<00:00:19.180> just<00:00:19.390> did

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
that's just the gravity bot we just did

that's just the gravity bot we just did
that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020

no<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.760> isn't<00:00:21.970> a<00:00:22.119> gravity<00:00:22.510> bot<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.800> came

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
no this isn't a gravity bot this came

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.579 
no this isn't a gravity bot this came
out<00:00:24.490> of<00:00:24.699> a<00:00:24.849> Happy<00:00:25.359> Meal<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:27.089> Japan<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:29.439> you're

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.620 
out of a Happy Meal in Japan what you're
seeing<00:00:29.920> is<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:30.310> bumblebee<00:00:30.910> based<00:00:31.300> on<00:00:31.509> the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
seeing is a bumblebee based on the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.290

what<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:36.399> saw<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.970> how<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.299> dark<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.990> the

what you just saw is how the dark of the
Moon<00:01:38.290> activators<00:01:38.950> worked<00:01:39.250> but<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.149> is<00:01:40.420> a

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
Moon activators worked but this is a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
the gravity BOTS and it was a Happy Meal

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.289 
the gravity BOTS and it was a Happy Meal
toy<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:48.310> not<00:01:48.490> sure<00:01:48.670> if<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.880> gimmick<00:01:49.149> was

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
toy I'm not sure if the gimmick was

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.389 
toy I'm not sure if the gimmick was
lifted<00:01:49.630> for<00:01:50.020> Dark<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.500> Moon<00:01:50.560> or<00:01:50.920> if<00:01:51.280> they

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
lifted for Dark of the Moon or if they

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.010 
lifted for Dark of the Moon or if they
used<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:51.820> make<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.270> McDonald's<00:01:52.810> toys<00:01:52.990> a
