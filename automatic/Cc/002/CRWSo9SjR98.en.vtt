there are multiple processes by which

there are multiple processes by which
these<00:00:02.909> endocrine<00:00:03.330> disrupters<00:00:03.929> enter<00:00:04.290> the

these endocrine disrupters enter the

these endocrine disrupters enter the
aquatic<00:00:04.830> environment<00:00:05.370> probably<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.000> most

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
plants all of the waste we produce in

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.340 
plants all of the waste we produce in
cities<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.620> communities<00:00:14.269> is<00:00:15.269> funneled<00:00:16.139> into

cities and communities is funneled into
wastewater<00:00:16.949> treatment<00:00:17.220> plants<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:17.970> are

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
wastewater treatment plants which are

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.420 
wastewater treatment plants which are
very<00:00:18.330> good<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.720> removing<00:00:19.310> nutrients<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
very good in removing nutrients and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.769 
very good in removing nutrients and
other<00:00:20.580> pollutants<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.480> they're<00:00:21.600> not

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
other pollutants but they're not

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.750 
other pollutants but they're not

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
designed to remove the compounds we

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
usually refer to Seneca disrupter so we

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.580 
usually refer to Seneca disrupter so we
often<00:00:26.550> measure<00:00:27.150> those<00:00:27.480> compounds<00:00:28.109> downstream

just so we still accept this and we

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.490 
increase in the waterways because the
body<00:02:23.940> doesn't<00:02:24.210> metabolize<00:02:24.600> all<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.140> them<00:02:25.290> so

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
body doesn't metabolize all of them so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.710 
body doesn't metabolize all of them so
I'm<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:25.920> coming<00:02:26.190> through<00:02:26.220> virtually<00:02:27.150> every

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
I'm just coming through virtually every

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.840 
I'm just coming through virtually every
pharmaceutical<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:29.010> we<00:02:29.190> take<00:02:29.550> into<00:02:29.730> our

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
pharmaceutical that we take into our

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.670 
pharmaceutical that we take into our
body<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.600> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:30.930> released<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.560> our

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
body is going to be released in our

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.580 
body is going to be released in our
urine<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.130> that's<00:02:32.310> why<00:02:32.550> when<00:02:33.500> people<00:02:34.500> are

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
urine so that's why when people are

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.530 
urine so that's why when people are
administered<00:02:35.130> drug<00:02:35.430> tests<00:02:35.880> they<00:02:36.210> collect

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
administered drug tests they collect

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.960 
administered drug tests they collect
urine<00:02:36.750> samples<00:02:37.550> usually<00:02:38.550> somewhere<00:02:38.850> between

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
urine samples usually somewhere between

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.140 
urine samples usually somewhere between
half<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.930> 75%<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> drug<00:02:41.520> goes<00:02:41.760> out<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.030> our

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
half and 75% of the drug goes out in our

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.780 
half and 75% of the drug goes out in our
urine<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.560> again<00:02:43.860> we<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.400> nice

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
urine so again we have this nice

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.960 
urine so again we have this nice
centralized<00:02:46.130> collection<00:02:47.130> system<00:02:47.460> for<00:02:47.640> sewage

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
centralized collection system for sewage

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.600 
centralized collection system for sewage
now<00:02:48.360> our<00:02:48.780> urine<00:02:49.260> usually<00:02:50.220> goes<00:02:50.370> down<00:02:50.520> the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
now our urine usually goes down the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
now our urine usually goes down the
sewer<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.050> all<00:02:52.200> concentrated<00:02:52.770> at

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
sewer and so it's all concentrated at

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.990 
sewer and so it's all concentrated at
the<00:02:52.920> waist<00:02:53.040> or<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.190> treatment<00:02:53.460> plant<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.910> then

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
the waist or a treatment plant and then

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.180 
the waist or a treatment plant and then
it<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.270> go<00:02:54.360> out<00:02:54.450> onto<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.750> road

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.050 

hormones<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:02.340> not<00:03:02.400> necessarily

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
hormones are not necessarily

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.960 
hormones are not necessarily
pharmaceuticals<00:03:03.900> those<00:03:04.230> are<00:03:04.970> often

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
pharmaceuticals those are often

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.670 
pharmaceuticals those are often
naturally<00:03:06.450> produced<00:03:06.750> from<00:03:06.900> her<00:03:06.990> body<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.440> I'm

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
naturally produced from her body so I'm

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.200 
naturally produced from her body so I'm
going<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> release<00:03:08.370> my<00:03:08.610> set<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.000> hormones

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
going to release my set of hormones

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.630 
going to release my set of hormones
every<00:03:09.510> day<00:03:09.750> I'm<00:03:10.560> not<00:03:10.800> currently<00:03:11.100> taking<00:03:11.490> any

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
every day I'm not currently taking any

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.360 
every day I'm not currently taking any
pharmaceutical<00:03:12.450> compounds<00:03:12.870> at<00:03:12.960> all<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.890> lot<00:03:14.280> of

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
pharmaceutical compounds at all a lot of

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.690 
pharmaceutical compounds at all a lot of
women<00:03:14.640> are<00:03:14.730> taking<00:03:15.260> birth<00:03:16.260> control<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.920> so

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
women are taking birth control and so

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.230 
women are taking birth control and so
that<00:03:18.630> introduces<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> set<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.130> either<00:03:20.940> high

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
that introduces a set of either high

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.300 
that introduces a set of either high
level<00:03:21.570> natural<00:03:21.960> hormones<00:03:22.350> or<00:03:22.650> even

level natural hormones or even

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.890

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.600 
artificial hormones into their bodies
that<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:25.350> again<00:03:25.560> be<00:03:25.710> excreted<00:03:26.070> out<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.490> their

that will again be excreted out in their
urine<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.120> then<00:03:27.900> go<00:03:28.200> through<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.800> place

well<00:03:46.520> bacteria<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.030> viruses<00:03:47.390> we<00:03:47.540> get<00:03:47.690> rid<00:03:47.900> of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
well bacteria and viruses we get rid of

well bacteria and viruses we get rid of
by<00:03:48.230> chlorinated<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.670> we<00:03:50.210> don't<00:03:50.390> filter<00:03:50.720> them

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.870 
by chlorinated so we don't filter them
out<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:51.710> we<00:03:51.800> kill<00:03:52.010> them<00:03:52.190> they<00:03:52.340> may<00:03:52.490> still<00:03:52.700> come
