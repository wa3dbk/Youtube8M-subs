not reviews and I think review started
well<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.080> review<00:00:25.500> idea<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.890> don't<00:00:25.920> think

well the first review idea I don't think

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.509 
well the first review idea I don't think
did<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:27.019> but<00:00:28.019> roughly<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:29.250> around

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
did that well but roughly just around

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.060 
did that well but roughly just around
2008<00:00:30.090> around<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:30.990> around<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.410> time<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
2008 around there around that time I

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.930 
2008 around there around that time I
started<00:00:32.430> doing<00:00:32.579> reviews<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:35.460> first<00:00:35.730> one

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
started doing reviews and the first one

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
started doing reviews and the first one
was<00:00:36.090> our<00:00:36.420> mortal<00:00:37.050> kombat<00:00:37.350> armageddon<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:38.129> the

was our mortal kombat armageddon on the
week<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.829> yes<00:00:40.829> since<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.550> built<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
week and yes since then it's built up to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
week and yes since then it's built up to
10,000<00:00:42.870> pretty<00:00:43.140> quick<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.530> these<00:00:43.710> last<00:00:43.890> few

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
10,000 pretty quick in these last few

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.779 
10,000 pretty quick in these last few
days<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.280> been<00:00:44.550> doing<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.030> fast<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.760> i

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
days it's been doing it really fast so i

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.770 
days it's been doing it really fast so i
thought<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> ten<00:00:49.140> thousand<00:00:50.039> mark<00:00:50.780> i

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.260 
thought for the ten thousand mark i
would<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.610> reviews<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> lot

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to do and I got to do it today because I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
to do and I got to do it today because I
think<00:01:38.700> last<00:01:38.850> time<00:01:39.000> i<00:01:39.180> looked<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
think last time i looked at the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
think last time i looked at the
subscriber<00:01:39.960> count<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.619> nine<00:01:41.159> thousand

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
subscriber count was up to nine thousand

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
subscriber count was up to nine thousand
nine<00:01:41.670> hundred<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.420> fifty<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:42.960> something<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.380> i

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
nine hundred and fifty or something so i

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.410 
nine hundred and fifty or something so i
figured<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> take<00:01:44.790> long<00:01:44.820> have

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
figured it's not going to take long have

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
figured it's not going to take long have
to<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.970> now<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> last<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.920> i'm<00:01:49.920> sort<00:01:50.250> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to go up now the last thing i'm sort of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.069 
to go up now the last thing i'm sort of
excited<00:01:50.729> about<00:01:50.790> doing<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.450> thought<00:01:51.689> I
