me<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> honestly<00:00:22.410> think<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.680> should've<00:00:22.949> been

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
me I honestly think that should've been

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.380 
me I honestly think that should've been
like<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> lead<00:00:23.430> singer<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.210> I

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
like the lead singer of all of it I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.089 
like the lead singer of all of it I
prefer<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.960> way<00:00:25.050> she's<00:00:25.230> sung<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> demo

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
prefer the way she's sung it in the demo

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.470 
prefer the way she's sung it in the demo
and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.939> people<00:00:27.060> were<00:00:27.300> saying

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and I think a lot of people were saying

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.790 
and I think a lot of people were saying
that<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.750> well<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> second<00:00:28.529> song<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that as well so the second song on the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
that as well so the second song on the
album<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.099> Venus<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.670> obviously<00:00:30.029> again<00:00:30.300> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
album is Venus and obviously again this

and the fact that lady gaga produced
this<00:00:39.210> song<00:00:39.480> herself<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.559> done
