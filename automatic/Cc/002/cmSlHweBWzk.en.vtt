hey guys it's Graham with tutorial
clarity<00:00:18.310> and<00:00:18.490> in<00:00:19.150> this<00:00:19.330> lesson<00:00:19.600> I'll<00:00:19.900> be

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
clarity and in this lesson I'll be

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.839 
clarity and in this lesson I'll be
showing<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:20.380> how<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.560> create<00:00:20.830> an<00:00:21.250> underground

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
showing you how to create an underground

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.720 
showing you how to create an underground
style<00:00:22.450> animation<00:00:22.860> it's<00:00:23.860> really<00:00:24.369> just<00:00:24.550> an

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
style animation it's really just an

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.999 
style animation it's really just an
abstract<00:00:25.390> wave<00:00:25.689> with<00:00:26.020> some<00:00:26.200> text<00:00:26.529> and<00:00:26.860> an

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
abstract wave with some text and an

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.730 
abstract wave with some text and an
adjustment<00:00:27.400> layer<00:00:27.550> but<00:00:28.419> uh<00:00:28.450> yeah<00:00:29.410> check<00:00:29.650> it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
adjustment layer but uh yeah check it

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:42.509 
adjustment layer but uh yeah check it
out<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.510> yeah<00:00:40.690> basically<00:00:41.019> I'm<00:00:41.620> just<00:00:41.680> using<00:00:42.250> the

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
out so yeah basically I'm just using the

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.770 
out so yeah basically I'm just using the
trapcode<00:00:42.879> form<00:00:43.769> plug-in<00:00:44.879> excuse<00:00:45.879> me<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.660> be

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
trapcode form plug-in excuse me so be

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.729 
trapcode form plug-in excuse me so be
sure<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:46.960> have<00:00:47.140> that<00:00:47.200> um<00:00:48.210> honestly<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:50.050> kind<00:00:50.559> of

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
sure to have that um honestly it kind of

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.290 
sure to have that um honestly it kind of
reminds<00:00:51.160> me<00:00:51.219> of<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.520> waving<00:00:51.879> parallel

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
reminds me of the waving parallel

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.410 
reminds me of the waving parallel
universes<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:53.440> know<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:54.789> the<00:00:54.910> ones<00:00:55.090> in<00:00:55.329> the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
universes you know like the ones in the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.770 
universes you know like the ones in the
string<00:00:55.750> theory<00:00:56.140> or<00:00:56.559> in<00:00:56.950> theory<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.660> know

yup<00:01:03.660> anyway<00:01:04.660> let's<00:01:04.989> go<00:01:05.080> ahead<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.320> get

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
yup anyway let's go ahead and get

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.969 
yup anyway let's go ahead and get
started

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
started

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.950 
started
I'm<00:01:06.070> going<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:06.820> go<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:06.970> composition<00:01:07.390> up<00:01:07.750> here

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
I'm going to go to composition up here

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.340 
I'm going to go to composition up here
and<00:01:08.110> then<00:01:08.979> new<00:01:09.250> composition<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:11.140> ahead

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
and then new composition and go ahead

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.749 
and then new composition and go ahead
and<00:01:11.530> pause<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:11.800> video<00:01:11.920> if<00:01:12.160> you<00:01:12.190> need<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.430> but

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
and pause the video if you need to but

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.680 
and pause the video if you need to but
just<00:01:12.940> have<00:01:13.360> all<00:01:13.539> my<00:01:13.750> settings<00:01:14.369> 1280<00:01:15.369> 720<00:01:16.180> and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
just have all my settings 1280 720 and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.510 
just have all my settings 1280 720 and
I'm<00:01:17.050> going<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.200> set<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.500> duration<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.160> eight

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
I'm going to set the duration to eight

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.830 
I'm going to set the duration to eight
seconds<00:01:20.640> alright<00:01:21.640> but<00:01:22.270> before<00:01:22.630> we<00:01:22.780> start

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
seconds alright but before we start

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
seconds alright but before we start
applying<00:01:23.440> effects<00:01:24.039> we're<00:01:24.459> going<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.640> need<00:01:24.759> to

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
applying effects we're going to need to

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.969 
applying effects we're going to need to
create<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.270> few<00:01:25.720> layers<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.709> we're<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:26.920> to

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
create a few layers so we're going to

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.830 
create a few layers so we're going to
start<00:01:27.220> off<00:01:27.369> by<00:01:27.399> creating<00:01:28.149> our<00:01:28.270> trapcode<00:01:28.630> form

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
start off by creating our trapcode form

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.109 
start off by creating our trapcode form
particle<00:01:29.800> layer<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:30.220> i'm<00:01:30.729> going<00:01:30.819> to<00:01:30.880> do<00:01:30.970> that

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
particle layer and i'm going to do that

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.949 
particle layer and i'm going to do that
by<00:01:31.209> going<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.509> layer<00:01:31.690> new<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.800> solid<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:34.690> i'm

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
by going to layer new and solid and i'm

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.559 
by going to layer new and solid and i'm
going<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.170> call<00:01:35.289> this<00:01:35.530> particles<00:01:36.280> as<00:01:36.459> always<00:01:37.390> I

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
going to call this particles as always I

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.800 
going to call this particles as always I
have<00:01:38.500> my<00:01:38.649> color<00:01:38.860> set<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.250> black<00:01:39.550> make<00:01:40.509> comp

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
have my color set to black make comp

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.040 
have my color set to black make comp
size<00:01:40.899> hit<00:01:41.560> okay<00:01:42.539> next<00:01:43.539> layer<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.810> we're

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
size hit okay next layer that we're

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.889 
size hit okay next layer that we're
going<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.200> create<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.739> our<00:01:44.890> text<00:01:45.310> layer<00:01:45.899> layer

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
going to create is our text layer layer

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.109 
going to create is our text layer layer
new<00:01:47.940> text<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:51.489> going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.670> type<00:01:51.910> in

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
new text and I'm just going to type in

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.729 
new text and I'm just going to type in
some<00:01:52.509> text<00:01:52.539> here<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.080> can<00:01:53.200> really<00:01:53.349> be<00:01:53.560> whatever

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:53.739 
some text here it can really be whatever

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.339 
some text here it can really be whatever
you<00:01:53.979> want<00:01:54.220> them<00:01:54.340> type<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.640> world<00:01:55.349> collisions

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
you want them type in world collisions

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.969 
you want them type in world collisions
and<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.880> really<00:01:58.780> like<00:01:58.989> the<00:01:59.229> century<00:01:59.709> gothic

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
and I really like the century gothic

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.880 
and I really like the century gothic
font<00:02:00.399> I<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.060> set<00:02:01.239> to<00:02:01.270> about<00:02:01.539> 30<00:02:02.080> pixels<00:02:02.649> to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
font I have it set to about 30 pixels to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.240 
font I have it set to about 30 pixels to
keep<00:02:03.069> that<00:02:03.220> kind<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.119> sleek<00:02:04.479> look<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:06.130> just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
keep that kind of sleek look it's just

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.800 
keep that kind of sleek look it's just
the<00:02:06.369> way<00:02:06.489> I<00:02:06.520> prefer<00:02:06.910> it<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.390> drag<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.750> over

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
the way I prefer it and drag that over

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.960 
the way I prefer it and drag that over
here<00:02:08.140> for<00:02:08.349> now<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:09.550> next<00:02:09.729> layer<00:02:09.879> that

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
here for now and the next layer that

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.430 
here for now and the next layer that
we're<00:02:10.179> going<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.330> create<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.720> our<00:02:10.869> adjustment

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
we're going to create is our adjustment

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.820 
we're going to create is our adjustment
layer<00:02:12.270> layer<00:02:13.270> new<00:02:13.720> adjustment<00:02:13.989> layer<00:02:14.470> and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
layer layer new adjustment layer and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.910 
layer layer new adjustment layer and
that's<00:02:15.790> pretty<00:02:16.030> much<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.540> um<00:02:16.690> down<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.800> I'm

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
that's pretty much it um down here I'm

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.320 
that's pretty much it um down here I'm
going<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.069> rename<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.610> adjustment<00:02:19.000> layer<00:02:19.150> by

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
going to rename the adjustment layer by

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.850 
going to rename the adjustment layer by
left<00:02:19.569> clicking<00:02:19.629> on<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.230> hitting<00:02:20.379> Enter<00:02:20.830> on

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
left clicking on it and hitting Enter on

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.760 
left clicking on it and hitting Enter on
the<00:02:21.100> keyboard<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:22.660> typing<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.290> switch

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
the keyboard and then typing in switch

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.020 
the keyboard and then typing in switch
here's<00:02:25.160> what<00:02:25.310> we're<00:02:25.400> going<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.580> be<00:02:25.670> doing<00:02:25.790> is

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
here's what we're going to be doing is

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.340 
here's what we're going to be doing is
using<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.390> switch<00:02:26.770> /<00:02:27.770> blur<00:02:28.390> effect<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.630> tied<00:02:30.200> to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
using a switch / blur effect a tied to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.690 
using a switch / blur effect a tied to
this<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.740> it's<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.280> going<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.460> create

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
this and it's a it's going to create

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.190 
this and it's a it's going to create
that<00:02:31.760> effect<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.300> saw<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.660> between<00:02:33.080> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that effect that you saw in between the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.500 
that effect that you saw in between the
two<00:02:33.350> scenes<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> video<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.090> start<00:02:35.360> off

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
two scenes in the video so to start off

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.390 
two scenes in the video so to start off
we're<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.050> actually<00:02:36.560> create<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.160> wave

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
we're going to actually create the wave

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.580 
we're going to actually create the wave
itself<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.270> going<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.450> click<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
itself so I'm going to click on the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.880 
itself so I'm going to click on the
particles<00:02:40.160> layer<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.600> I'm<00:02:42.380> going<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.560> rename

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
particles layer and I'm going to rename

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.940 
particles layer and I'm going to rename
this<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.160> particles<00:02:43.940> one<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:45.230> that'll<00:02:45.860> be

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
this to particles one and that'll be

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.560 
this to particles one and that'll be
easy<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.310> understand<00:02:46.730> later<00:02:46.940> because<00:02:47.420> we're

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
easy to understand later because we're

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.850 
easy to understand later because we're
going<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.720> end<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:48.050> splitting<00:02:48.470> all<00:02:48.680> these

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
going to end up splitting all these

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.150 
going to end up splitting all these
layers<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:50.000> uh<00:02:50.030> we'll<00:02:50.510> get<00:02:50.600> along<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.990> that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
layers but uh we'll get along to that

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
layers but uh we'll get along to that
particles<00:02:52.160> one<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.550> then<00:02:52.640> I'm<00:02:52.730> going<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.000> go

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
particles one and then I'm going to go

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.480 
particles one and then I'm going to go
to<00:02:53.240> layer<00:02:53.510> I'm<00:02:53.900> sorry<00:02:54.350> effect<00:02:54.680> excuse<00:02:55.160> me<00:02:55.400> and

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
particles and X we're going to set that

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.080 
particles and X we're going to set that
to<00:03:34.820> about<00:03:35.000> 350<00:03:35.680> particles<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.800> Y<00:03:37.100> set<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:37.970> to

to about 350 particles in Y set that to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.840 
to about 350 particles in Y set that to
about<00:03:38.240> 600<00:03:38.990> and<00:03:39.110> particles<00:03:40.100> in<00:03:40.250> Z<00:03:40.520> we're<00:03:40.730> going

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
about 600 and particles in Z we're going

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.180 
about 600 and particles in Z we're going

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
to set that to one and that means

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.950 
to set that to one and that means
there's<00:03:43.400> only<00:03:43.490> going<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> be<00:03:43.790> one<00:03:44.120> plane<00:03:44.690> of

actually almost done with this we're

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.280 
actually almost done with this we're
going<00:03:48.710> to<00:03:48.770> go<00:03:48.890> down<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.190> another<00:03:49.280> very<00:03:49.670> useful

we're going to set the displace to 170

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.980 
we're going to set the displace to 170
and<00:04:03.910> give<00:04:04.910> that<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> second<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.660> can<00:04:05.810> already

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
and give that a second you can already

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.740 
and give that a second you can already

we're<00:04:25.400> going<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.550> leave<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.940> octave

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
we're going to leave the octave

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.760 
we're going to leave the octave
multiplier<00:04:26.690> octave<00:04:27.080> scale<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.470> going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.650> be

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
multiplier octave scale is going to be

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.219 
multiplier octave scale is going to be
1.8<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:30.980> looking<00:04:31.280> pretty<00:04:31.670> nice

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
1.8 and that is looking pretty nice

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.050 
1.8 and that is looking pretty nice
pretty<00:04:33.229> nice<00:04:33.440> I'm<00:04:33.590> going<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.800> drag<00:04:34.040> my<00:04:34.100> world

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
pretty nice I'm going to drag my world

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.159 
pretty nice I'm going to drag my world
collisions<00:04:35.570> text<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.080> better<00:04:36.320> location

probably<00:04:37.889> about<00:04:38.070> there<00:04:38.430> it's<00:04:38.760> more<00:04:38.940> readable

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
probably about there it's more readable

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.510 
probably about there it's more readable
more<00:04:40.350> readable<00:04:41.780> anyway<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.100> get<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.400> that

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
more readable anyway so to get to that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.879 
more readable anyway so to get to that
blur<00:04:44.910> effect<00:04:45.389> we<00:04:46.290> need<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.560> apply<00:04:46.860> a

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
blur effect we need to apply a

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.460 
blur effect we need to apply a
directional<00:04:47.699> blur<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.240> our<00:04:48.360> adjustment<00:04:49.169> layer

directional blur to our adjustment layer

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.870 
directional blur to our adjustment layer
so<00:04:49.500> I'm<00:04:49.830> going<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.010> click<00:04:50.160> on<00:04:50.280> my<00:04:50.400> adjustment

to go to effect blur and sharpen and

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.659 
to go to effect blur and sharpen and
then<00:04:55.740> directional<00:04:56.669> blur<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:58.580> what<00:04:59.580> we're

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
then directional blur and what we're

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.490 
then directional blur and what we're
going<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.850> need<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.300> do<00:05:00.540> is<00:05:00.810> from<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.139> get-go

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
going to need to do is from the get-go

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.740 
going to need to do is from the get-go
it<00:05:01.650> kind<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:01.889> blurs<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.520> starts<00:05:03.330> off<00:05:03.479> on<00:05:03.660> the

it kind of blurs in starts off on the

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.090 
it kind of blurs in starts off on the
very<00:05:03.990> first<00:05:04.260> frame<00:05:04.530> so<00:05:04.680> I'm<00:05:04.770> going<00:05:04.889> to<00:05:04.919> pull

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
very first frame so I'm going to pull

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.420 
very first frame so I'm going to pull
down<00:05:05.130> here<00:05:05.669> go<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.270> effect<00:05:07.160> directional<00:05:08.160> blur

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
down here go to effect directional blur

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.370 
down here go to effect directional blur
and<00:05:08.760> we're<00:05:09.360> going<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.540> leave<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.870> direction

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
and we're going to leave the direction

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.379 
and we're going to leave the direction
at<00:05:10.500> zero<00:05:10.800> because<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.729> prefer<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.210> be

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
at zero because I prefer it to be

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.900 
at zero because I prefer it to be
completely<00:05:13.040> up-and-down<00:05:14.040> for<00:05:14.550> this<00:05:14.700> type<00:05:14.880> of

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
completely up-and-down for this type of

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.550 
completely up-and-down for this type of
effect<00:05:15.300> but<00:05:15.570> you<00:05:15.780> can<00:05:16.050> change<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.410> if<00:05:16.530> you

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
effect but you can change that if you

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.379 
effect but you can change that if you
like<00:05:16.800> basically<00:05:17.700> we're<00:05:17.940> going<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.090> left-click

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
like basically we're going to left-click

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.560 
like basically we're going to left-click
on<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.780> stopwatch<00:05:19.020> here<00:05:19.470> from<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.820> zero<00:05:21.270> or

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
on the stopwatch here from the zero or

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.300 
on the stopwatch here from the zero or
first<00:05:21.930> frame<00:05:22.260> all<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.770> way<00:05:22.889> up<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.340> 15<00:05:24.270> frames

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
first frame all the way up to 15 frames

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.350 
first frame all the way up to 15 frames
that's<00:05:26.310> about<00:05:26.580> good<00:05:26.760> because<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.240> to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
that's about good because I like it to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.810 
that's about good because I like it to
be<00:05:27.450> very<00:05:27.540> quick<00:05:28.200> technically<00:05:28.680> 30<00:05:29.310> frames

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
be very quick technically 30 frames

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.270 
be very quick technically 30 frames
would<00:05:30.360> be<00:05:30.570> our<00:05:30.870> compositions<00:05:31.560> at<00:05:31.680> 30<00:05:31.889> frames<00:05:32.039> a

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
would be our compositions at 30 frames a

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.430 
would be our compositions at 30 frames a
second<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:32.820> if<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:33.030> move<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.270> 30<00:05:33.570> frames<00:05:33.750> it

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
second so if I move to 30 frames it

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.650 
second so if I move to 30 frames it
converts<00:05:34.979> over<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.340> one<00:05:35.490> second<00:05:35.940> I'm<00:05:36.419> gonna<00:05:36.600> go

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
converts over to one second I'm gonna go

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.600 
converts over to one second I'm gonna go
to<00:05:36.720> about<00:05:36.930> half<00:05:37.229> a<00:05:37.380> second<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:37.860> that's<00:05:38.220> 15

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
to about half a second and that's 15

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.540 
to about half a second and that's 15
frames<00:05:39.110> so<00:05:40.110> I'm<00:05:40.199> going<00:05:40.350> to<00:05:40.410> set<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:41.160> blur

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
frames so I'm going to set the blur

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.360 
frames so I'm going to set the blur
length<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:42.210> zero<00:05:42.539> again<00:05:42.720> by<00:05:43.139> clicking<00:05:43.370> this

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
length to zero again by clicking this

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.150 
length to zero again by clicking this
little<00:05:45.470> diamond-shaped<00:05:46.470> button<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.039> that's

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
little diamond-shaped button and that's

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.920 
little diamond-shaped button and that's
inserts<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.669> keyframe<00:05:48.030> we're<00:05:48.660> going<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.840> go

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
inserts a keyframe we're going to go

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.510 
inserts a keyframe we're going to go
back<00:05:49.139> to<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.410> very<00:05:49.590> beginning<00:05:50.070> make<00:05:50.370> sure

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
back to the very beginning make sure

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.700 
back to the very beginning make sure
we're<00:05:50.669> on<00:05:50.789> that<00:05:50.940> frame<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.530> double<00:05:52.530> click

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
we're on that frame and double click

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.010 
we're on that frame and double click
this<00:05:52.919> gives<00:05:53.550> us<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:53.940> pop-up<00:05:54.300> called<00:05:54.810> blur

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
this gives us a pop-up called blur

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.810 
this gives us a pop-up called blur
length<00:05:55.349> and<00:05:55.680> we're<00:05:56.130> going<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.310> set<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.610> value

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
length and we're going to set the value

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.460 
length and we're going to set the value
to<00:05:58.160> 55<00:05:59.160> so<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.270> very<00:06:00.419> first<00:06:00.660> frame<00:06:00.990> this<00:06:01.260> thing
