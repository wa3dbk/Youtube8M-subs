strategic side of worms games it's going

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.069 
strategic side of worms games it's going
to<00:01:15.880> be<00:01:15.999> a<00:01:16.030> head-scratcher<00:01:16.539> and<00:01:16.749> I<00:01:16.780> think<00:01:16.959> it's

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
to be a head-scratcher and I think it's

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.440 
to be a head-scratcher and I think it's
really<00:01:17.409> going<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.619> excite<00:01:18.459> people<00:01:18.700> when<00:01:19.359> they

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
really going to excite people when they

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.629 
really going to excite people when they
finally<00:01:19.689> get<00:01:19.899> to<00:01:20.139> finish<00:01:20.679> one<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.490> puzzles

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
there's 20 of those in total so there's

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.429 
there's 20 of those in total so there's
plenty<00:01:24.130> there<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.310> keep<00:01:24.520> people<00:01:24.579> going<00:01:25.439> let's

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
plenty there to keep people going let's

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.319 
plenty there to keep people going let's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.599 
probably my favorite mode what we've got
there<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.620> similar<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> deathmatch<00:03:25.069> mode<00:03:25.280> in

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
there is similar to a deathmatch mode in

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.000 
there is similar to a deathmatch mode in
fact<00:03:25.819> but<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.209> landscape<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.840> set<00:03:27.079> into<00:03:27.230> two

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
fact but the landscape is set into two

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.400 
fact but the landscape is set into two
separate<00:03:28.639> thoughts<00:03:29.120> one<00:03:29.510> either<00:03:29.780> side<00:03:30.109> with<00:03:30.380> a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
separate thoughts one either side with a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.190 
separate thoughts one either side with a
body<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.739> water<00:03:30.889> in<00:03:31.220> between<00:03:31.750> now<00:03:32.750> this<00:03:32.930> means

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
body of water in between now this means

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.449 
body of water in between now this means
that<00:03:33.319> you've<00:03:33.650> got<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.950> use<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.100> little<00:03:34.280> bit<00:03:34.370> more

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
that you've got to use a little bit more

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.280 
that you've got to use a little bit more
strategy<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:35.180> because<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.870> can't<00:03:36.109> get

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
strategy here because you can't get

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.170 
strategy here because you can't get
directly<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> opposing<00:03:37.489> teams<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:38.120> you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
directly to the opposing teams so you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.580 
directly to the opposing teams so you
might<00:03:38.480> want<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.660> use<00:03:38.780> hi<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.079> your<00:03:39.290> advantage

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
might want to use hi to your advantage

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.480 
might want to use hi to your advantage
and<00:03:39.829> try<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.099> get<00:03:40.220> shots<00:03:40.519> down<00:03:40.730> from<00:03:40.970> above

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
and try and get shots down from above

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.080 
and try and get shots down from above
to<00:03:42.090> bunker<00:03:42.780> down<00:03:42.960> and<00:03:43.290> maybe<00:03:44.160> do<00:03:44.520> hit<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.940> run

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
to bunker down and maybe do hit and run

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.050 
to bunker down and maybe do hit and run
darkside<00:03:45.840> tactics<00:03:46.350> essential<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.220> either

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
darkside tactics essential and either

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.420 
darkside tactics essential and either
way<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:48.960> forts<00:03:49.650> mode<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:50.010> probably<00:03:50.310> going

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
way I think forts mode is probably going

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.130 
way I think forts mode is probably going
to<00:03:50.490> be<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.640> one<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.060> people<00:03:51.210> get<00:03:51.630> most<00:03:51.900> fun

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
to be the one that people get most fun

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.410 
to be the one that people get most fun
especially<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:52.980> me<00:03:53.130> because<00:03:53.850> aside<00:03:54.180> from<00:03:54.240> the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
especially for me because aside from the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.700 
especially for me because aside from the
fact<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.720> looks<00:03:54.900> beautiful<00:03:55.110> as<00:03:55.470> well<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.650> think

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
fact it looks beautiful as well I think

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.690 
fact it looks beautiful as well I think
it's<00:03:55.950> probably<00:03:56.100> one<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> most<00:03:56.460> beautiful

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
it's probably one of the most beautiful

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.900 
it's probably one of the most beautiful
landscapes<00:03:57.390> will<00:03:57.540> create<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> 40<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.910> lastly

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
landscapes will create the 40 and lastly

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.880 
landscapes will create the 40 and lastly
we've<00:04:00.480> got<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.690> classic<00:04:01.050> way<00:04:01.170> now<00:04:01.770> the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
we've got the classic way now the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.790 
we've got the classic way now the
classic<00:04:02.310> mode<00:04:02.490> is<00:04:02.820> for<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.870> worms<00:04:04.020> purists

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
classic mode is for the worms purists

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.220 
classic mode is for the worms purists
it's<00:04:05.070> for<00:04:05.670> people<00:04:05.820> who<00:04:06.060> have<00:04:06.660> played<00:04:06.870> worms

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
it's for people who have played worms

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.290 
it's for people who have played worms
before<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:07.980> maybe<00:04:08.340> they<00:04:08.670> want<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.910> experience

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
before and maybe they want to experience

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.050 
before and maybe they want to experience
that<00:04:10.260> same<00:04:10.680> kind<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.250> game<00:04:11.460> they<00:04:11.670> don't<00:04:11.880> want

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
that same kind of game they don't want

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.940 
that same kind of game they don't want
to<00:04:12.210> have<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.540> dynamic<00:04:12.690> water<00:04:13.080> they<00:04:13.740> don't

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
to have the dynamic water they don't

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.890 
to have the dynamic water they don't
want<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.280> have<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.030> mess<00:04:15.180> about<00:04:15.300> with<00:04:15.450> learn<00:04:15.750> to

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
want to have to mess about with learn to

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.410 
want to have to mess about with learn to
classes<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.489> maybe<00:04:17.489> they<00:04:17.670> don't<00:04:17.790> want<00:04:17.910> the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
classes and maybe they don't want the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.180 
classes and maybe they don't want the
random<00:04:19.049> nature<00:04:19.170> that<00:04:19.440> physics<00:04:19.770> object<00:04:20.040> might

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
random nature that physics object might

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.730 
random nature that physics object might
include<00:04:20.370> in<00:04:20.610> the<00:04:20.700> map<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.540> that's<00:04:22.110> all<00:04:22.350> removed

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
include in the map so that's all removed

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.970 
include in the map so that's all removed
and<00:04:23.040> they<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.520> get<00:04:23.670> on<00:04:23.850> with<00:04:23.880> playing<00:04:24.330> worms

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
and they can get on with playing worms

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.780 
and they can get on with playing worms
classically<00:04:25.980> as<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.580> was<00:04:26.670> originally

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
classically as it was originally

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.670 
classically as it was originally
intended<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.080> there's<00:04:28.320> something<00:04:28.500> for

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
intended so there's something for

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.090 
intended so there's something for
