that's<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.599> standard<00:00:16.410> tuning<00:00:16.800> except<00:00:17.039> for

I<00:00:22.560> guess<00:00:23.340> I'll<00:00:23.490> play<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> through<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.380> then<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
I guess I'll play it through and then I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:52.120 
I guess I'll play it through and then I
will<00:00:26.160> show<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.609> how<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:27.029> it

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
all right that's all goes I guess first

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.800 
all right that's all goes I guess first
you're<00:01:19.729> really<00:01:19.909> not<00:01:20.119> playing<00:01:20.359> that<00:01:20.509> many

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
you're really not playing that many

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990 
you're really not playing that many
different<00:01:21.229> notes<00:01:21.469> it's<00:01:22.219> pretty<00:01:22.490> simple<00:01:22.789> song

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
different notes it's pretty simple song

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.880 
different notes it's pretty simple song
really<00:01:23.320> you're<00:01:24.320> going<00:01:24.439> to<00:01:24.500> start<00:01:24.710> out<00:01:24.860> by

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
really you're going to start out by

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.490 
really you're going to start out by
playing<00:01:25.340> your<00:01:25.570> 5th<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:26.719> 6th<00:01:26.990> string<00:01:27.170> 3rd<00:01:27.229> fret

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
playing your 5th and 6th string 3rd fret

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.249 
playing your 5th and 6th string 3rd fret
and<00:01:28.219> then<00:01:28.429> you're<00:01:28.549> going<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.700> jump<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.420> 5th

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
and then you're going to jump to the 5th

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.719 
and then you're going to jump to the 5th
fret<00:01:30.520> 5th<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.670> 6th<00:01:31.759> ring<00:01:32.270> same<00:01:32.750> thing<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:33.920> guess

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
fret 5th and 6th ring same thing I guess

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:43.179 
fret 5th and 6th ring same thing I guess
you<00:01:34.850> just<00:01:34.909> gotta<00:01:36.670> see<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:42.500> gonna<00:01:42.619> be<00:01:42.740> open

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
you just gotta see it's gonna be open

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.969 
you just gotta see it's gonna be open
then<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.000> hammer<00:01:44.149> onto<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.689> 3rd<00:01:45.439> fret<00:01:45.649> 5th

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
then you hammer onto the 3rd fret 5th

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.069 
then you hammer onto the 3rd fret 5th
and<00:01:46.100> 6th<00:01:46.340> string<00:01:46.549> going<00:01:47.509> off<00:01:47.799> open<00:01:48.819> fifth

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
and 6th string going off open fifth

00:01:50.079 --> 00:02:00.520 
and 6th string going off open fifth
fifth<00:01:51.079> fret<00:01:51.319> fifth<00:01:51.709> and<00:01:51.829> sixth<00:01:52.069> string<00:01:59.530> for

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
fifth fret fifth and sixth string for

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:09.130 
fifth fret fifth and sixth string for
that<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:01.039> do<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.390> right<00:02:02.539> there

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.650 

I<00:02:09.200> get<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.429> point<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.000> going<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.240> be<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
I get to that point it's going to be the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.260 
I get to that point it's going to be the
sixth<00:02:12.290> string<00:02:12.560> fourth<00:02:13.459> fret<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.030> did<00:02:14.180> it

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
sixth string fourth fret and I did it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.250 
sixth string fourth fret and I did it
with<00:02:14.360> an<00:02:14.450> edge<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.690> my<00:02:14.780> pick<00:02:16.900> ten<00:02:17.900> do<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> little

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
with an edge of my pick ten do a little

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.340 
with an edge of my pick ten do a little
bit<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.500> pinch<00:02:18.740> harmonic<00:02:19.190> at<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.459> end<00:02:20.350> that's

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
bit of pinch harmonic at the end that's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.920 
bit of pinch harmonic at the end that's
kind<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.620> up<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.480> then<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:23.780> going<00:02:23.870> to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
kind of up to you and then it's going to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
kind of up to you and then it's going to
be<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.140> same<00:02:24.350> third<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.250> fifth<00:02:25.400> breath

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
be the same third and fifth breath

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.050 
be the same third and fifth breath
doesn't<00:02:25.970> sing<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.270> string<00:02:27.370> after<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
doesn't sing a string after that the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.699 
doesn't sing a string after that the
only<00:02:32.240> difference<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.750> now<00:02:32.930> you're<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.560> from

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
only difference is now you're going from

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.590 
only difference is now you're going from
the<00:02:33.830> third<00:02:34.070> fret<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.880> fifth<00:02:35.180> fret<00:02:35.420> and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
the third fret to the fifth fret and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.680 
the third fret to the fifth fret and
then<00:02:36.140> slightly<00:02:36.940> getting<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.150> third<00:02:38.390> fret

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
then slightly getting that third fret

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:48.050 
then slightly getting that third fret
again

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150 

that's<00:02:49.050> all<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.800> really<00:02:49.920> pretty

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
that's all that it is it's really pretty

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.340 
that's all that it is it's really pretty
simple<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.790> then<00:02:51.330> for<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.870> guess<00:02:52.230> you'd

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
simple and then for the I guess you'd

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.440 
simple and then for the I guess you'd
call<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.560> solo<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.370> not<00:02:53.490> really<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> solo<00:02:54.090> but

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
call it solo so not really a solo but

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.100 
call it solo so not really a solo but
you're<00:02:54.990> gonna<00:02:55.080> slide<00:02:55.380> down<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.400> order

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
you're gonna slide down on you order

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.880 
you're gonna slide down on you order
let's<00:02:58.110> see<00:02:58.290> fourth<00:02:58.680> string<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:01.290> slide<00:03:01.620> down

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
let's see fourth string here slide down

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.630 
let's see fourth string here slide down
to<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.580> twelfth<00:03:03.000> fret<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:05.100> then<00:03:05.490> you're

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
to the twelfth fret and then you're

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.060 
to the twelfth fret and then you're
gonna<00:03:05.790> jump<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.890> second<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.040> third

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
gonna jump up to the second and third

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.090 
gonna jump up to the second and third
string<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.750> tenth<00:03:09.990> fret<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.470> then<00:03:10.890> your

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
string on the tenth fret and then your

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.860 
string on the tenth fret and then your
second<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.670> third<00:03:11.700> string<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.570> twelfth

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
second and third string on the twelfth

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.320 
second and third string on the twelfth
fret

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330 

that's<00:03:21.379> pretty<00:03:22.379> much<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:23.099> kind<00:03:23.280> of

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that's pretty much it just kind of

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.460 
that's pretty much it just kind of
listen<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.760> watch<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.150> guess<00:03:24.330> for<00:03:24.599> when<00:03:25.379> you

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
listen and watch I guess for when you

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:34.120 
listen and watch I guess for when you
pluck<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:25.980> or<00:03:26.099> whatever

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.220
