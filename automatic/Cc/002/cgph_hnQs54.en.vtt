00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 the challenge for these three brothers 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.660
 besides convincing his parents that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 support us in this race was in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.199
 prove that being a dj leads beyond 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.800
 put music at parties because 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.800
 beginning 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.210
 to which there is no longer 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.210
 the works like 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.010
 laughter 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.410
 thus 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.450
 Carlos VelÃ¡squez will continue to forge this 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.000
 path that today has led them to be a 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.180
 example for many young people trying 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.840
 make my way as djs of my saldanha 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.840
 aztec news 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.749
 we combine the sensations with the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.749
 public 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.200
 and it does a function for people 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:53.430
 is dancing is to combine technology 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.900
 combine two songs so they are two 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.739
 songs in one song those 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.739
 electronic rhythms 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:18.230
 then we could find a story 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.230
 that does not come out 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.730
 must have a person who wants to be a dj 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:47.430
 because I'm going to tell you nothing more 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:50.819
 but it takes time for the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.599
 times for that patient burying 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.620
 to put the song so that it is usually born 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.620
 as equal 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.240
 music 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.550
 it's part of your career 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.970
 this expression 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.660
 I've been here for 15 years now 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.660
 we continue that 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.199
 good we have meat but of the same 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.960
 with the Mexican 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:45.180
 and there are fewer people 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.370
 when you call 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.780
 and if it is correct we have always tried 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.780
 like your mother 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.710
 that's the problem is what you wear 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.660
 many times with the cndh will have the 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.470
 opportunity to be the star is next 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.470
 in the morning 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.310
 definitely appearing this 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.310
 music crap 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.949
 in these 20 years but 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.949
 to be Mexican 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.260
 it is not easy 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.330
 thank you very much 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
