00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
this and i'll show you the RCO l is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.910 
this and i'll show you the RCO l is
everything<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.170> highlighted<00:01:19.590> which<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
everything you see highlighted which is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.230 
everything you see highlighted which is
basically<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.580> column<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.090> why

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
basically the right column that's why

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.929 
basically the right column that's why
it's<00:01:21.390> called<00:01:21.420> our<00:01:21.780> co<00:01:22.049> l<00:01:22.430> that's<00:01:23.430> why<00:01:23.549> he<00:01:23.700> calls

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it's called our co l that's why he calls

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's called our co l that's why he calls
it<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.740> then<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:26.759> style<00:01:27.030> our<00:01:27.150> module<00:01:27.630> its

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it that and then to style our module its

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.580 
it that and then to style our module its
div<00:01:28.140> dot<00:01:28.530> module<00:01:28.829> table<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.689> div<00:01:31.049> dot

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
div dot module table so it's div dot

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.340 
div dot module table so it's div dot
module<00:01:33.259> module<00:01:34.259> table<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
module module table so this is going to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
module module table so this is going to
style<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> whole<00:01:38.220> part<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.909> our<00:01:39.329> module

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
style the whole part of our module

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.050 
style the whole part of our module
everything<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.610> let's<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:41.939> up

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.810 
everything around it and so let's go up
to<00:01:42.090> our<00:01:42.240> box<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.930> he's<00:01:43.200> styling<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.009> let's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
you'll notice it puts the box around it

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.490 
you'll notice it puts the box around it
we've<00:02:08.140> borrowed<00:02:08.500> his<00:02:08.800> styling<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:10.319> yeah<00:02:11.319> it

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
we've borrowed his styling and yeah it

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
next well if you look at our example

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.150 
next well if you look at our example
we're<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.019> do<00:02:17.170> somehow<00:02:17.380> get<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.709> color

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
we're going to do somehow get this color

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.600 
we're going to do somehow get this color
or<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.550> background<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:19.239> there<00:02:19.540> also<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.610> it

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
or this background in there also and it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.570 
or this background in there also and it
looks<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> text<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.599> bit<00:02:23.050> different

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
looks like the text is a bit different

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.890 
looks like the text is a bit different
so<00:02:24.580> let's<00:02:24.790> go<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> our<00:02:25.030> style<00:02:25.390> master<00:02:25.750> here

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
so let's go to our style master here

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.800 
so let's go to our style master here
let's<00:02:26.080> see<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:26.319> he<00:02:26.440> did<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:27.670> go<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.849> box<00:02:28.120> h2<00:02:28.599> so

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810

it says down here h 3 ok we pasted this
in<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.230> let's<00:03:12.040> refresh<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:12.609> see<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:12.940> it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
in and let's refresh it and see if it

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.000 
in and let's refresh it and see if it
does<00:03:13.239> anything<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.440> did<00:03:14.560> kind<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.829> change

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
does anything and it did kind of change

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.620 
does anything and it did kind of change
the<00:03:15.130> color<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.579> match<00:03:15.790> more<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.209> styling

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
the color and match more of the styling

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.120 
the color and match more of the styling
so<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:16.930> good<00:03:17.970> but<00:03:18.970> now<00:03:19.120> how<00:03:19.239> do<00:03:19.299> we<00:03:19.420> get

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
so that's good but now how do we get

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.560 
so that's good but now how do we get
this<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.459> background<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:22.120> he<00:03:22.329> has<00:03:22.420> this

going to paste it in our div module

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.830 
going to paste it in our div module
table<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.819> let's<00:03:42.819> see<00:03:42.970> what<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.209> looks<00:03:43.269> like

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.559 

save<00:03:46.840> it

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.770 

fresh<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.030> it's<00:03:52.030> getting<00:03:52.150> closer<00:03:52.450> you'll

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
fresh it and it's getting closer you'll

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.349 
fresh it and it's getting closer you'll
notice<00:03:53.109> but<00:03:54.099> you'll<00:03:54.249> notice<00:03:54.609> here<00:03:54.819> that<00:03:54.849> it's

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
notice but you'll notice here that it's

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.429 
notice but you'll notice here that it's
tiling<00:03:56.819> along<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.969> whole<00:03:58.150> module<00:03:58.389> but<00:03:59.290> we're

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
tiling along the whole module but we're

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.379 
tiling along the whole module but we're
missing<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.859> here<00:04:00.129> where<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.670> padding<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.209> or

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
missing it here where the padding is or

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.140 
missing it here where the padding is or
the<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.900> differences<00:04:02.349> between<00:04:02.939> where<00:04:03.939> this

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
the the differences between where this

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.809 
the the differences between where this

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.770 
information is held and our module up
here<00:04:08.670> well<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:09.879> would<00:04:10.120> probably<00:04:10.299> be<00:04:10.450> easily

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
here well that would probably be easily

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.009 
here well that would probably be easily
fixed<00:04:11.079> if<00:04:11.319> we<00:04:11.469> make<00:04:11.650> this<00:04:11.829> background<00:04:13.019> repeat

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
fixed if we make this background repeat

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.009 
fixed if we make this background repeat
also<00:04:14.439> in<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.709> h3<00:04:15.189> tag<00:04:15.449> so<00:04:16.449> let's<00:04:16.660> go<00:04:16.810> ahead<00:04:16.840> and

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
also in the h3 tag so let's go ahead and

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.930 
also in the h3 tag so let's go ahead and
go<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.229> our<00:04:17.320> style<00:04:17.769> master<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.400> let's<00:04:18.639> copy

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
go to our style master and let's copy

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.909 
go to our style master and let's copy
this<00:04:19.209> out<00:04:19.919> save<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:22.199> so<00:04:23.199> basically<00:04:23.320> we've<00:04:23.680> just

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
this out save it so basically we've just

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.129 
this out save it so basically we've just
duplicated<00:04:24.550> our<00:04:24.639> image<00:04:24.910> here<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.360> let's<00:04:26.020> see

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
duplicated our image here and let's see

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.879 
duplicated our image here and let's see
if<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.380> works<00:04:26.789> refresh<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:27.970> looks<00:04:28.570> good<00:04:28.889> so

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
if that works refresh it looks good so

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.230 
if that works refresh it looks good so
let's<00:04:29.979> go<00:04:30.130> ahead<00:04:30.160> give<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.400> some<00:04:30.580> padding<00:04:31.030> and

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
let's go ahead give it some padding and

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.939 
let's go ahead give it some padding and
some<00:04:31.419> other<00:04:31.539> things<00:04:31.870> let's<00:04:32.410> see<00:04:32.560> how<00:04:32.650> close<00:04:32.889> we

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
some other things let's see how close we

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.249 
some other things let's see how close we
are<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.370> other<00:04:33.580> or<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.090> original<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
are to the other or the original and

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.140 
are to the other or the original and
we're<00:04:35.349> pretty<00:04:35.500> close<00:04:35.710> other<00:04:36.009> than<00:04:36.190> image<00:04:36.940> and

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
we're pretty close other than image and

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.310 
we're pretty close other than image and
things<00:04:37.330> like<00:04:37.449> that<00:04:37.509> that<00:04:37.780> aren't<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.110> there

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
things like that that aren't in there

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.760 
things like that that aren't in there
that<00:04:38.979> looks<00:04:39.190> pretty<00:04:39.370> close<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.440> let's<00:04:41.560> give<00:04:41.710> it

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
that looks pretty close so let's give it

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:51.290 
that looks pretty close so let's give it
some<00:04:41.830> padding<00:04:44.190> so<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.340> looks<00:04:45.550> decent

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.100 

heading<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:53.210> maybe<00:04:54.210> around<00:04:54.419> five<00:04:54.659> pixels

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
heading and maybe around five pixels

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.320 
heading and maybe around five pixels
let's<00:04:55.379> try<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:58.250> save<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.280> out<00:04:59.520> let's<00:05:00.060> tab

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
let's try that save it out let's tab

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.890 
let's try that save it out let's tab
over<00:05:00.659> see<00:05:01.050> what<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:01.229> looks<00:05:01.379> like<00:05:02.569> and<00:05:03.569> if<00:05:03.840> we

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
over see what it looks like and if we

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.659 
over see what it looks like and if we
keep<00:05:04.080> refreshing<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:05.250> looks<00:05:05.400> good

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
keep refreshing it that looks good

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.450 
keep refreshing it that looks good
decent<00:05:06.090> padding<00:05:06.659> and<00:05:07.050> we've<00:05:07.740> just<00:05:07.770> styled<00:05:08.340> our

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
decent padding and we've just styled our

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.520 
decent padding and we've just styled our
module<00:05:08.879> now<00:05:09.840> if<00:05:09.930> we<00:05:10.020> scroll<00:05:10.199> down<00:05:10.379> to<00:05:10.470> the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
module now if we scroll down to the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.980 
module now if we scroll down to the
bottom<00:05:10.940> you'll<00:05:11.940> notice<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.270> it's<00:05:12.720> also

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
bottom you'll notice that it's also

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.140 
bottom you'll notice that it's also
doing<00:05:13.349> it<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.620> bottom<00:05:13.770> here<00:05:14.129> well<00:05:14.789> there's

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
doing it to the bottom here well there's

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.740 
doing it to the bottom here well there's
a<00:05:15.210> couple<00:05:15.330> ways<00:05:15.509> we<00:05:15.750> can<00:05:15.900> fix<00:05:16.110> this<00:05:17.479> we<00:05:18.479> could

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
a couple ways we can fix this we could

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.230 
a couple ways we can fix this we could
try<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.139> go<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.500> our<00:05:19.650> style<00:05:19.919> mastering<00:05:20.400> scroll

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
try to go to our style mastering scroll

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.709 
try to go to our style mastering scroll
down<00:05:21.360> here<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.840> see<00:05:22.020> if<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.229> is<00:05:22.259> in<00:05:22.470> its<00:05:22.770> own

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:23.719 
down here and see if this is in its own

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.510 
down here and see if this is in its own
separate<00:05:24.719> div<00:05:25.469> but<00:05:25.740> it's<00:05:25.860> not<00:05:26.039> you'll<00:05:26.280> notice

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
separate div but it's not you'll notice

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.610 
separate div but it's not you'll notice
it's<00:05:26.669> still<00:05:26.879> in<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.389> right<00:05:28.139> column

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
it's still in the in the right column

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.890 
it's still in the in the right column
just<00:05:29.219> like<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:30.840> other<00:05:30.960> one<00:05:31.110> is<00:05:32.389> so<00:05:33.389> there's

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
just like the other one is so there's

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.119 
just like the other one is so there's
another<00:05:34.139> way<00:05:34.349> to<00:05:34.409> do<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:34.740> it's<00:05:34.979> called

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
another way to do this it's called

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.110 
another way to do this it's called
module<00:05:35.639> class<00:05:35.819> suffixes<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:38.490> if<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.060> click

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
module class suffixes and and if I click

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.899 
module class suffixes and and if I click
on<00:05:39.419> this<00:05:39.479> we<00:05:40.199> can<00:05:40.349> add<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.500> suffix<00:05:41.069> to<00:05:41.520> our<00:05:41.669> div

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
on this we can add a suffix to our div

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.170 
on this we can add a suffix to our div
module<00:05:42.330> table<00:05:42.770> by<00:05:43.770> let's<00:05:44.129> go<00:05:44.669> ahead<00:05:44.819> and<00:05:44.909> call

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
module table by let's go ahead and call

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.930 
module table by let's go ahead and call
this<00:05:45.330> top<00:05:45.599> so<00:05:45.810> we<00:05:45.840> go<00:05:46.020> dash<00:05:46.289> top<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:47.370> everything

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
this top so we go dash top so everything

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.040 
this top so we go dash top so everything
with<00:05:48.180> dash<00:05:48.419> top<00:05:48.750> peers<00:05:49.199> let's<00:05:49.590> do<00:05:49.740> dash<00:05:50.430> top<00:05:54.050> it

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
with dash top peers let's do dash top it

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.180 
with dash top peers let's do dash top it
looks<00:05:55.259> like<00:05:55.380> those<00:05:55.529> are<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.710> only<00:05:55.800> two<00:05:56.009> we've

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
looks like those are the only two we've

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.860 
looks like those are the only two we've
styled<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:56.819> let<00:05:57.120> me<00:05:57.180> save<00:05:57.419> it<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:57.719> you'll

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
styled and let me save it and you'll

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.930 
styled and let me save it and you'll
notice<00:05:58.229> that<00:05:58.500> we're<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.639> lose<00:05:59.759> our
