 we have another do that is that I'm passing 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.160
 yobai in your program 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.220
 you have to do eight steps and then 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.519
 stack on top later like this like that until 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.910
 that one only that up and then 3 2 7 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.440
 6 5 4 3 2 1 up to 1 up to 1 and then 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.830
 you all have to close without it 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.830
 fall 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 1 minute 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
 Y 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 and if I lose I can eat it dessert 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:20.240
 this second row of glasses this 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 practicing 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.060
 30 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.880
 I thought there was a lot of 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.890
 and now 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.820
 Y 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.189
 they brought thanks guys like what 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:12.220
 they made it so simple in the program 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:17.010
 like 7 7 6 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.010
 minute to win let's use 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.580
 newspaper if it was ten minutes to 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.090
 win but 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.090
 where 38 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.130
 does not know how to cut either 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.109
 when we do 2 minutes to win you 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.109
 there are too many 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.150
 5 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.680
 coming 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.050
 I'm not dying, I'm dying 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.960
 yes i have time 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.950
 yes 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.110
 you have to practice you get much better 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.319
 easy but the easiest and it's not 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.319
 so easy
