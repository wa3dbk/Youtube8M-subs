00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
downward slope so so you can see that

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.600 
downward slope so so you can see that
the<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.780> pelvic<00:04:03.200> floor<00:04:03.440> muscle<00:04:03.860> scoops<00:04:04.280> down

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.910 
and it supports the organs it supports
the<00:04:07.880> back<00:04:08.120> passage<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.780> rectum<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.380> supports

the back passage the rectum it supports

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.190

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
the prostate and the bladder and then it

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.680 
the prostate and the bladder and then it
attaches<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:12.800> front<00:04:13.130> things<00:04:14.060> go<00:04:14.270> through<00:04:14.510> the

attaches in front things go through the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.360 
attaches in front things go through the
pelvic<00:04:15.050> floor<00:04:15.080> because<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.710> goal<00:04:15.920> before<00:04:16.070> is

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
pelvic floor because the goal before is

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.040 
pelvic floor because the goal before is
not<00:04:16.520> just<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:16.880> line<00:04:17.150> of<00:04:17.180> muscle

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
not just a line of muscle

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.229 
not just a line of muscle
it's<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.530> basin<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.190> muscle<00:04:19.610> that<00:04:19.640> comes<00:04:20.000> out<00:04:20.209> to

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
it's a basin of muscle that comes out to

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.480 
it's a basin of muscle that comes out to
the<00:04:20.540> side<00:04:20.780> as<00:04:21.020> well<00:04:21.230> I<00:04:21.260> got<00:04:21.650> like<00:04:21.800> a<00:04:21.860> big<00:04:22.160> bowl

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
the side as well I got like a big bowl

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.980 
the side as well I got like a big bowl
of<00:04:22.760> muscle<00:04:23.380> when<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:24.530> contract<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:26.540> pelvic

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.570 
floor and it's a muscle like any other
muscle<00:04:29.690> when<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.170> tighten<00:04:30.530> or<00:04:30.950> tense<00:04:31.340> your

muscle when you tighten or tense your
pelvic<00:04:32.000> floor<00:04:32.380> because<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.530> wants<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.890> shorten

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
pelvic floor because it wants to shorten

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.110 
pelvic floor because it wants to shorten
but<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.920> can't<00:04:37.220> shorten<00:04:37.670> because<00:04:38.000> it's

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
but it can't shorten because it's

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.820 
but it can't shorten because it's
attached<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.660> bone<00:04:38.840> at<00:04:39.050> both<00:04:39.230> ends<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.680> don't

if you can't shorten all it could do is

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.470 
if you can't shorten all it could do is
