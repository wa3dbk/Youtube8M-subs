be opened I think there's going to be a
happy<00:00:39.930> hour<00:00:40.050> later<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.010> maybe<00:00:41.250> he'll<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> like

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

60 or 70 k i'm not too sure i can't
guarantee<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.200> taking<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:46.770> icing

1980<00:00:51.690> finishing<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.500> good<00:00:52.680> he's<00:00:53.129> only

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
1980 finishing which is good he's only

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.670 
1980 finishing which is good he's only
got<00:00:53.399> 73<00:00:53.850> free<00:00:54.180> kick<00:00:54.390> accuracy<00:00:54.719> which<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> bit

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
got 73 free kick accuracy which a bit

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.439 
got 73 free kick accuracy which a bit
surprising<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.280> he<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:56.640> score<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
surprising because he actually score the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.700 
surprising because he actually score the
free<00:00:57.629> kick<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> thought<00:00:58.230> it'd<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.410> higher

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
free kick so I thought it'd be higher

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
free kick so I thought it'd be higher
than<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> he's<00:00:59.579> got<00:00:59.670> 80<00:00:59.850> long<00:01:00.120> shot<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
than that he's got 80 long shot a to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.860 
than that he's got 80 long shot a to
ensure<00:01:00.989> past<00:01:01.320> 78<00:01:02.250> shot<00:01:02.609> power<00:01:02.850> 80<00:01:03.210> volley<00:01:03.570> so

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
ensure past 78 shot power 80 volley so

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570 
ensure past 78 shot power 80 volley so
good<00:01:04.080> shooting<00:01:04.409> starts<00:01:04.680> overall<00:01:05.100> high

improved<00:03:10.400> competitor<00:03:11.400> was<00:03:11.520> not<00:03:11.670> informed<00:03:12.030> we

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
improved competitor was not informed we

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.600 
improved competitor was not informed we
can<00:03:12.270> actually<00:03:12.600> send<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.650> some<00:03:13.800> decent<00:03:14.130> crosses

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
can actually send in some decent crosses

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.760 
can actually send in some decent crosses
its<00:03:15.120> short<00:03:15.360> passing<00:03:15.750> through<00:03:16.050> balls<00:03:16.350> are<00:03:16.620> good

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
its short passing through balls are good

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.770 
its short passing through balls are good
as<00:03:16.920> well<00:03:16.950> that's<00:03:17.730> something<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.360> noticed

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
as well that's something that I noticed

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.780 
as well that's something that I noticed
it<00:03:18.840> was<00:03:18.870> an<00:03:19.020> improvement<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:20.130> he's<00:03:20.310> not<00:03:20.520> just

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
it was an improvement that he's not just

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.480 
it was an improvement that he's not just
like<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> one-trick<00:03:22.050> pony<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:22.920> Payson

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
like a one-trick pony of just Payson

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.180 
like a one-trick pony of just Payson
skill<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.690> he<00:03:25.080> can<00:03:25.260> actually<00:03:25.590> pass<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:26.040> now

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
skill that he can actually pass it now

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.180 
skill that he can actually pass it now
so<00:03:26.550> yeah<00:03:27.390> he<00:03:27.690> definitely<00:03:28.080> got<00:03:28.620> an<00:03:28.740> improvement

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
so yeah he definitely got an improvement

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.300 
so yeah he definitely got an improvement
compared<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.270> his<00:03:30.390> not<00:03:30.540> inform<00:03:30.870> card<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.380> I

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
compared to his not inform card and I

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.280 
compared to his not inform card and I
would<00:03:32.670> say<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.270> know<00:03:33.390> tendencies<00:03:33.900> now<00:03:34.110> sure

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
would say you know tendencies now sure

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.470 
would say you know tendencies now sure
our<00:03:34.470> wiis<00:03:34.710> better<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:35.670> prefer<00:03:36.060> team<00:03:36.300> that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
our wiis better and I prefer team that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.990 
our wiis better and I prefer team that
he's<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.230> eye<00:03:37.260> itch<00:03:37.530> but<00:03:37.830> there<00:03:38.730> will<00:03:38.880> be

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
he's in the eye itch but there will be

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.220 
he's in the eye itch but there will be
people<00:03:39.240> who<00:03:39.270> prefer<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.720> card<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.170> I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
people who prefer this card and I

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.660 
people who prefer this card and I
thought<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.560> was<00:03:40.650> really<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.190> good<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.610> he

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
thought it was really really good and he

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.880 
thought it was really really good and he
was<00:03:41.940> an<00:03:42.090> improvement<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.840> his<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.440> informed

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
was an improvement on his not informed

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.400 
was an improvement on his not informed
so<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.459> conclusion<00:03:44.610> his<00:03:45.600> weaknesses<00:03:46.080> are<00:03:46.290> of

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
so in conclusion his weaknesses are of

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.290 
so in conclusion his weaknesses are of
course<00:03:46.650> he's<00:03:46.950> very<00:03:47.160> very<00:03:47.250> weak<00:03:47.670> which<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.150> what

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
course he's very very weak which is what

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.449 
course he's very very weak which is what
you<00:03:48.390> expect<00:03:48.840> with<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.740> guy<00:03:49.830> who's<00:03:50.040> five<00:03:50.280> foot

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
you expect with a guy who's five foot

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.370 
you expect with a guy who's five foot
four<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.700> 36<00:03:51.390> strength<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.810> was<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.020> bit<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.320> a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
four and 36 strength it was a bit of a

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.710 
four and 36 strength it was a bit of a
letdown<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.520> I<00:03:53.610> said<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.880> do<00:03:54.060> expect<00:03:54.510> us

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
letdown but like I said you do expect us

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.960 
letdown but like I said you do expect us
so<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.100> main<00:03:56.250> weakness<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.850> of

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
so that is the main weakness and of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.310 
so that is the main weakness and of
course<00:03:57.180> his<00:03:57.300> headings<00:03:57.630> not<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.930> good<00:03:58.080> either

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
course his headings not that good either

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.070 
course his headings not that good either
due<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.250> his<00:03:59.459> height<00:03:59.700> so<00:04:00.360> you're<00:04:00.870> not<00:04:01.020> really

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
due to his height so you're not really

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.300 
due to his height so you're not really
going<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.500> be<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.680> position<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:02.010> head<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
going to be in a position to head the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.650 
going to be in a position to head the
ball<00:04:02.340> with<00:04:02.610> him<00:04:02.700> but<00:04:02.850> if<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.090> are<00:04:03.120> he's<00:04:03.420> not

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
ball with him but if you are he's not

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.330 
ball with him but if you are he's not
going<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.840> do<00:04:03.959> anything<00:04:04.200> with<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.440> but<00:04:05.130> his

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
going to do anything with it but his

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.610 
going to do anything with it but his
strengths<00:04:05.820> were<00:04:06.030> his<00:04:06.209> pace<00:04:06.480> which<00:04:07.050> had<00:04:07.590> a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
strengths were his pace which had a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.140 
strengths were his pace which had a
slight<00:04:07.890> improvement<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.520> terms<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.970> his

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
slight improvement in terms of his

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.449 
slight improvement in terms of his
acceleration<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:10.140> dribbling<00:04:10.860> was<00:04:11.010> really

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
acceleration it dribbling was really

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.130 
acceleration it dribbling was really
really<00:04:11.700> good<00:04:11.760> with<00:04:12.150> four<00:04:12.390> star<00:04:12.630> skill<00:04:12.870> moves

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
really good with four star skill moves

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.590 
really good with four star skill moves
his<00:04:13.290> shot<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.220> general<00:04:14.520> was<00:04:14.670> good<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:15.300> great

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
his shot in general was good with great

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.500 
his shot in general was good with great
finishing<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.290> long<00:04:16.560> shot<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.040> his<00:04:17.760> passing

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
finishing and long shot and his passing

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.729 
finishing and long shot and his passing
