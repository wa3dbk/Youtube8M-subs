and last year's finishers and you know
about<00:00:41.700> halfway<00:00:42.000> through<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.810> event

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
about halfway through the event

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.070 
about halfway through the event
following<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> dots<00:00:44.130> is<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.060> I<00:00:45.270> decided<00:00:45.810> it

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
following the dots is when I decided it

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.740 
following the dots is when I decided it
was<00:00:46.200> something<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.620> had<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.489> ever<00:00:48.450> since
