versus pure and I assume from the very
beginning<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.230> would<00:00:58.380> be<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.740> of<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
beginning that this would be one of the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
beginning that this would be one of the
hardest<00:00:59.280> groups<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.970> call<00:01:00.240> just<00:01:00.990> because<00:01:01.080> all

at the two o'clock position blue is calm
so<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.659> means<00:02:06.930> down<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> eight<00:02:07.409> o'clock

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
so that means down at the eight o'clock

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.759 
so that means down at the eight o'clock
position<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> whatever<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.910> pure<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
position and whatever is pure this is

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.180 
position and whatever is pure this is
our<00:02:11.040> new<00:02:11.180> map<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.080> OSL<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:13.769> not<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.160> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
our new map of the OSL it's not really a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.370 
our new map of the OSL it's not really a
new<00:02:14.430> map<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> little<00:02:15.630> bit<00:02:15.750> disappointed

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
new map I was a little bit disappointed

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.320 
new map I was a little bit disappointed
when<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:16.860> said<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.220> match<00:02:17.519> point<00:02:17.910> was

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
when they said that match point was

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.060 
when they said that match point was
going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.959> fourth<00:02:19.230> map<00:02:19.410> for<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.650> OSL

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
going to be the fourth map for the OSL

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.800 
going to be the fourth map for the OSL
because<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:20.790> are<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:20.940> many<00:02:21.269> new<00:02:21.570> maps

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
because there are so many new maps

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.630 
because there are so many new maps
coming<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> pro<00:02:22.530> league<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.370> thought

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
coming to the pro league that I thought

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.729 
coming to the pro league that I thought
oh<00:02:23.850> maybe<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.450> these<00:02:24.600> one<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.320> these<00:02:25.440> weird

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
oh maybe one of these one of these weird

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.670 
oh maybe one of these one of these weird
new<00:02:26.070> maps<00:02:26.340> will<00:02:26.580> show<00:02:26.760> up<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.660> nope<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.440> got

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
new maps will show up but nope we got

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.640 
new maps will show up but nope we got
this<00:02:28.890> one<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:29.310> still<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.420> OSL<00:02:30.870> does<00:02:31.410> have

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
this one but still the OSL does have

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.449 
this one but still the OSL does have
some<00:02:32.250> kind<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.580> exclusive<00:02:33.000> maps<00:02:34.010> has<00:02:35.010> great

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
some kind of exclusive maps has great

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.160 
some kind of exclusive maps has great
barrier<00:02:35.760> reef<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.150> eye<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.450> storm<00:02:36.570> which

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
barrier reef and eye of the storm which

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.009 
barrier reef and eye of the storm which
are<00:02:38.100> not<00:02:38.400> played<00:02:38.730> pretty<00:02:39.150> much<00:02:39.360> anywhere<00:02:39.750> else

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
are not played pretty much anywhere else

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.160 
are not played pretty much anywhere else
so<00:02:40.370> at<00:02:41.370> least<00:02:41.489> there's<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.330> fighting

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so at least there's that and fighting

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
so at least there's that and fighting
spirit<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.799> match<00:02:44.400> point<00:02:44.760> those<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.239> our

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
spirit and match point those are our

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.449 
spirit and match point those are our
four<00:02:45.750> maps<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.350> likely<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.739> stay<00:02:46.860> our<00:02:47.190> four

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
four maps and likely to stay our four

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.180 
four maps and likely to stay our four
