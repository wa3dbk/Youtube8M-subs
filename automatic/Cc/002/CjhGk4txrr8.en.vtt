00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 today we will talk about them 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.139
 it all started with a small team 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.510
 divisional development of nintendo 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.400
 I hope to create ten mythical years 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.029
 like super mario bros the age of zelda 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.439
 starfox h 08 min and so on 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.430
 have finished the work and on the wii u 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.289
 and this launching game 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.449
 these five employees wanted to create a 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.220
 new type of game without worrying that 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.379
 it ranks for such games 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.720
 particular video and so create some 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.370
 different thing from mario and zelda a 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.410
 six-month brainstorming this project 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.790
 will give more than 70 waters create a 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 new license from these 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.899
 departments knowing that the last 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.250
 date still 14 years old and like for 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.710
 each new license of nintendo 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.329
 the concept is the first thing that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.100
 matter and that's one of the bits of 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.710
 shintaro sato that will give the concept of 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.809
 base or what will become this plateau in 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.790
 this demo of tofu cubes projected from 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.680
 launch and the goal was to cover 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.360
 as late as possible while getting 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.770
 camouflaging by his painting for not 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.110
 being fooled by his opponent 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.640
 the 4-on-4 online mode was 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.899
 however already present however 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.680
 sell a game with crazy everything like 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.229
 playable character 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.100
 it's more than complicated so he 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.259
 now needed to find a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.850
 character the team thought to include 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.640
 mario especially with the subtle link 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.310
 between super mario sunshine and this concept 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.319
 basic but mario clean the paint 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.270
 which was contrary to the idea 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.940
 conductive instead of rabbits have 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.440
 been chosen because of the white cloud felt it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.599
 will be easier to know if he was 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.610
 buy or not their ears 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.929
 offered an idea about investments but 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.849
 once in front of the investors 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.679
 rationally justified as rabbits 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.240
 lang shooting was difficult 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.830
 by reflecting how just effect 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.380
 that a stone character of throwing a 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.990
 designer proposed the squid is sitting 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.429
 was created the human inkling character 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.619
 before being transmitted in clamart in 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.690
 the den to hide the game is 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.700
 then presented to the finite right to ten 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.880
 percent or he received a warm welcome 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.069
 then it will be released in May 2015 on wiiu 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.630
 first of all i'm glad that nintendo does not 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.039
 do not fall into this trap of following 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.750
 the example of competing shooters 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.360
 because he finally offers us a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.759
 new original and creative license 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.310
 this evolving paintball concept offers a 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.440
 fast and fun gameplay is also 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.120
 accompanied by very colorful graphics and 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.700
 a soundtrack for the surprising mar 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.379
 but damn catchy 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.209
 the heart of the game is basically 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.160
 focused on my multiplayer that makes 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.890
 oppose two teams of four players 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.420
 the goal is simple to cover the most 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.430
 territory possible with its color 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.780
 of ink and rare thing in a game of 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.239
 shoot killing his opponents 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.099
 is for once the priority because it 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.019
 does not yield any additional points 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.300
 there is also a solo mode that 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.370
 consists of rescue missions and 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.500
 which makes me think a little about galaxy galaxy 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.000
 in the level design more than 80 weapons and 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.980
 equipment are available in order to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.450
 customize your character and so 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.040
 improve some of its capabilities 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.230
 to better anchor your opponent 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.330
 sochaux in battle speaking standards 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.810
 these are divided into three classes 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.250
 rifle launcher and roll the first 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.940
 corresponds to assault rifles in 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.040
 somehow 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.230
 the second is the sniper class with a 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.269
 dirk loaded the last one groups of 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.040
 weapons covering a large area 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.260
 although young offers so far only six 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.299
 hitano cards promises wildlife and dlc 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.790
 free regularly with new 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.840
 weapons and a new ball and that that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.610
 good example to follow 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.140
 of course he stays and amigo who 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.160
 are coming out of paying enough with 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.940
 missions and equipment 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.280
 additional 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.870
 in short stone was very well received 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.940
 by critics even winning the often 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.290
 of our maps and shooting games and the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.139
 first sales results should 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.880
 delay mr left if kenny 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.470
 a new license that will be enhanced 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.370
 with time just like mario kart and 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.370
 and smash bros and resell
