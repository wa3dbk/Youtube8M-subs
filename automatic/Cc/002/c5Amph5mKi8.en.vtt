00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of these I believe I've reviewed them I

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.470 
of these I believe I've reviewed them I
really<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.550> solid<00:01:02.969> color<00:01:03.210> but

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
really like these it's a solid color but

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.870 
really like these it's a solid color but
it's<00:01:03.629> got<00:01:03.809> sort<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> check<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.880> some

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's got sort of a check to it some

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.820 
it's got sort of a check to it some
black<00:01:06.150> check<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.780> same<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
black check in there same with the the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
black check in there same with the the
red<00:01:08.010> ones<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> looks<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
red ones so I think it looks kind of

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
red ones so I think it looks kind of
cool<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> outsole<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:13.170> white<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.070> feel

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
cool the outsole it's white but I feel

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.640 
cool the outsole it's white but I feel
like<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.700> sort<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.299> an<00:01:15.420> off-white<00:01:15.650> it's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
like it's sort of like an off-white it's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.640 
like it's sort of like an off-white it's
almost<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.250> grey<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.439> definitely

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
almost like a grey so it definitely

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
almost like a grey so it definitely
plays<00:01:20.040> well<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.140> blue<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.880> your
