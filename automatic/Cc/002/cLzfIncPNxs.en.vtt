based<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.879> feedback<00:03:01.300> we<00:03:01.330> received<00:03:01.959> from

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
based on the feedback we received from

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.470 
based on the feedback we received from
the<00:03:02.560> pilots<00:03:03.010> who<00:03:03.129> participated<00:03:03.879> in<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.300> phase

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
the pilots who participated in the phase

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.710 
the pilots who participated in the phase
one<00:03:04.690> experiment<00:03:05.319> we<00:03:05.830> can<00:03:06.040> conclude<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.819> all

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
one experiment we can conclude that all

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.050 
one experiment we can conclude that all
pilots<00:03:08.110> believe<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.799> will<00:03:09.040> be<00:03:09.250> possible<00:03:09.760> to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
pilots believe that will be possible to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.119 
pilots believe that will be possible to
operate<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.599> aircraft<00:03:10.750> safely<00:03:11.230> during<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
operate the aircraft safely during the

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.830 
operate the aircraft safely during the
air-to-air<00:03:12.489> refueling<00:03:13.150> maneuver<00:03:13.569> with<00:03:13.810> a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
air-to-air refueling maneuver with a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.720 
air-to-air refueling maneuver with a
highly<00:03:14.230> automated<00:03:14.379> flight<00:03:14.830> control<00:03:15.310> system

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
highly automated flight control system

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.630 
highly automated flight control system
do<00:03:16.629> you<00:03:16.810> think<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:18.040> cruiser<00:03:18.310> feeder

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
do you think that the cruiser feeder

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.319 
do you think that the cruiser feeder
concept<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:20.040> demonstrated<00:03:21.040> can<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.150> be

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
concept that we demonstrated can it be

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.100 
concept that we demonstrated can it be
implemented<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.440> real<00:03:23.709> life<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.720> would<00:03:25.720> say<00:03:25.870> so

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
implemented in real life I would say so

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.979 
implemented in real life I would say so
from<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.799> technical<00:03:27.670> point<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.209> view<00:03:28.390> it

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
from the technical point of view it

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.229 
from the technical point of view it
would<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.349> possible<00:03:29.590> what<00:03:30.160> we<00:03:30.280> saw<00:03:30.519> today<00:03:30.819> if

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
would be possible what we saw today if

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.119 
would be possible what we saw today if
everything<00:03:31.810> works<00:03:32.489> automated<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:34.079> think<00:03:35.129> it's

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
everything works automated I think it's

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.490 
everything works automated I think it's
not<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> big<00:03:36.670> deal

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
not a big deal

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.069 
not a big deal
everything<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.650> smooth<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:40.450> think<00:03:40.870> also

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
everything is smooth and I think also

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.690 
everything is smooth and I think also
safe<00:03:41.590> device<00:03:41.980> if<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:43.450> system<00:03:44.200> works

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
safe device if the system works

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.100 
safe device if the system works
automated<00:03:45.700> as<00:03:45.849> you<00:03:46.030> are<00:03:46.209> planning<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:46.930> it

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
automated as you are planning to do it

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.940 
automated as you are planning to do it
there<00:03:48.099> should<00:03:48.250> be<00:03:48.430> no<00:03:48.549> problem

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.810 

yeah<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:56.980> think<00:03:57.130> it's<00:03:59.100> it's<00:04:00.100> easy<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.640> monitor

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
yeah I think it's it's easy to monitor

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.270 
yeah I think it's it's easy to monitor
it<00:04:01.240> with<00:04:01.600> this<00:04:01.720> automation<00:04:02.170> C's<00:04:02.740> high<00:04:02.890> level

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
it with this automation C's high level

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.540 
it with this automation C's high level
of<00:04:03.340> automation<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:04.290> our<00:04:05.290> jobs<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.920> monitor<00:04:06.370> it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
of automation and our jobs to monitor it

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.270 
of automation and our jobs to monitor it
and<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.210> to<00:04:07.660> abort<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.080> before<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.800> safe

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and to to abort it before the safe

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.570 
and to to abort it before the safe
disinfectant<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:11.770> can<00:04:11.980> do<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.370> with

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
disinfectant and you can do that with

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.750 
disinfectant and you can do that with
this<00:04:12.730> system<00:04:13.080> that's<00:04:14.080> okay

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
this system that's okay

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760 
this system that's okay
Oh
