00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
together it uses palm muting uses some

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.540 
together it uses palm muting uses some
basic<00:01:03.960> open<00:01:04.350> chord<00:01:04.680> shapes<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.309> they're<00:01:05.460> all

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
basic open chord shapes but they're all

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.969 
basic open chord shapes but they're all
modified<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
modified a little bit because of the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
modified a little bit because of the
tuning<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> tuning<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.510> relatively

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
tuning now the tuning is relatively

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.460 
tuning now the tuning is relatively
simple<00:01:10.800> but<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.550> bit<00:01:11.700> unusual<00:01:11.820> uh<00:01:12.240> north<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:13.410> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
simple but a bit unusual uh north in a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
simple but a bit unusual uh north in a
lot<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> songs<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.399> done<00:01:14.610> by<00:01:14.790> lowering

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
lot of songs and it's done by lowering

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.090 
lot of songs and it's done by lowering
your<00:01:15.390> first<00:01:15.630> two<00:01:15.840> strings<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.350> whole<00:01:16.530> step<00:01:16.770> each

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
your first two strings a whole step each

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120 
your first two strings a whole step each
so<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> E<00:01:17.850> string<00:01:18.180> goes<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.690> D<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.800> B

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so the E string goes down to D and the B

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.670 
so the E string goes down to D and the B
string<00:01:20.460> goes<00:01:20.640> down<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.170> she<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.290> then

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
string goes down to a she also then

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.130 
string goes down to a she also then
Capo's<00:01:23.160> it<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> seventh<00:01:23.910> fret<00:01:24.210> putting<00:01:24.990> us

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140

by<00:01:42.929> tuning<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.410> whole<00:01:43.590> guitar<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.190> whole<00:01:44.399> step

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
by tuning the whole guitar a whole step

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.699 
by tuning the whole guitar a whole step
lower<00:01:44.910> in<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> first<00:01:45.810> place<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.319> then<00:01:46.500> keep

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.309 
stuff so the chords though are pretty
simply<00:02:15.900> an<00:02:16.110> E<00:02:16.470> minor<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.830> C<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.250> G<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.150> D<00:02:18.480> just

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
simply an E minor a C a G and a D just

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.350 
simply an E minor a C a G and a D just
alternate<00:02:19.890> ways<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.310> play<00:02:20.550> playing<00:02:21.000> them<00:02:21.209> up

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
alternate ways of play playing them up

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.150 
alternate ways of play playing them up
here<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.900> getting

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
here and getting

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.100 
here and getting
little<00:02:23.820> Melanie<00:02:24.180> notes<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.660> been<00:02:24.870> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
little Melanie notes that have been and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.060 
little Melanie notes that have been and
with<00:02:25.320> them<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:28.140> kind<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.380> get<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
with them so it's just kind of get the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.460 
with them so it's just kind of get the
hang<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.370> playing<00:02:29.640> these<00:02:29.790> chords<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.300> some

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
hang of playing these chords with some

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
hang of playing these chords with some
unusual<00:02:31.470> notes<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.070> them<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.910> we<00:02:32.970> also

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
unusual notes in them and then we also

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.700 
unusual notes in them and then we also
talked<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> little<00:02:33.780> bit<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.960> theory<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.620> as

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
talked a little bit of theory in here as

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.020 
talked a little bit of theory in here as
far<00:02:34.740> as<00:02:34.920> what<00:02:35.100> we<00:02:35.220> would<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.400> call<00:02:35.760> those

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
far as what we would really call those

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.700 
far as what we would really call those
chords<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.050> addition<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
chords because of the addition of the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.580 
chords because of the addition of the
extra<00:02:38.010> notes<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.290> encourage<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.440> come

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
extra notes so encourage you to come

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.590 
extra notes so encourage you to come

you want to learn a little bit more
about<00:02:43.590> alternate<00:02:44.130> tunings<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.720> that

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
about alternate tunings this one that

about alternate tunings this one that
doesn't<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.530> probably<00:02:47.070> doesn't<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.430> an

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
official name we could maybe call it eat

gab<00:02:49.200> because<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:49.830> fairly<00:02:50.040> closely

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
gab because that's fairly closely
