 for what is right that this is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.420
 a little dylan story and the title of 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.619
 remember and the American title is seen 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.619
 that the project was developed in 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.119
 united as like up with american 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.180
 American actors we shot in new 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.180
 york 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.710
 the idea of ​​the idea of ​​the film was born because 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.800
 I looked at these guys they did 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.680
 freerunning parker and at that time 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.080
 I thought it was these crazy people they managed to 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 achieve what in the film matrix 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.810
 they pretended it had to be 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.190
 science fiction instead they do it for 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 really started doing research 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.230
 he began to see that actually 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.150
 behind this sport this discipline 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.460
 there was actually a philosophy there was a 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.020
 way of life and there were choices that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.330
 these young people did that they were a lot 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.490
 interesting that are connected by one 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.040
 part of the theme of physical preparation 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.930
 to be ready in an emergency 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.700
 in the case of having to help others e 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.620
 so the city and the environment are not 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.910
 more than obstacles but become gods 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.010
 objects of things that one can 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.290
 use in an emergency to per 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.240
 help and discipline on the other 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.580
 mental because through sport 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.260
 physical and always staying in shape 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.730
 in practice you can express your art 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.410
 through the physical here that I said 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.540
 instead something interesting because 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.880
 I thought of a story that could 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.980
 express this someone who leaves from 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.190
 misuse of their abilities e 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.930
 then switch to using it instead for the reason 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.100
 just the original reason 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.100
 of the free run and the park
