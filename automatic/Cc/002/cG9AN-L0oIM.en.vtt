00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
this point on I will probably be using

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
this point on I will probably be using
these<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.659> whole<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:52.130> hitting<00:01:53.130> them

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
these a whole lot and hitting them

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.819 
these a whole lot and hitting them
advanced<00:01:53.909> pretty<00:01:54.210> quickly<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.409> first<00:01:55.649> I'm

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
advanced pretty quickly so first I'm

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.870 
advanced pretty quickly so first I'm
going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.189> swing<00:01:56.549> Bros<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.329> guy

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.260 

and<00:02:01.170> swing<00:02:02.170> Bros<00:02:02.470> has<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.890> best<00:02:03.280> advance<00:02:03.909> move

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and swing Bros has the best advance move

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.230 
and swing Bros has the best advance move
of<00:02:04.570> all<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:05.080> them<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.380> think<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:06.490> just<00:02:06.790> really

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
of all of them I think it's just really

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.100 
of all of them I think it's just really
really<00:02:07.450> good<00:02:09.240> whoops<00:02:10.240> missed<00:02:10.600> that

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
really good whoops missed that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.960 
really good whoops missed that
now<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:11.890> up<00:02:12.420> anta<00:02:13.420> by<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.380> here

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
now this up anta by that you see here

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.370 
now this up anta by that you see here
this<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> only<00:02:16.390> technique<00:02:16.660> as<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.050> will

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
this is the only technique as you will

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.670 
this is the only technique as you will
flash<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.120> silhouette<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.500> whoever<00:02:20.500> he's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
flash the silhouette of whoever he's

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.550 
flash the silhouette of whoever he's
going<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.070> attack<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.020> real<00:02:23.020> easy<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.350> dodge

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
going to attack and real easy to dodge

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.240 
going to attack and real easy to dodge
just<00:02:23.980> pay<00:02:24.190> attention<00:02:28.590> I'll<00:02:29.590> see<00:02:29.800> if<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.130> get

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
just pay attention I'll see if I can get

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.270 
just pay attention I'll see if I can get
that<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.580> with<00:02:30.610> Luigi<00:02:31.150> okay<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.530> there<00:02:39.250> are

that one with Luigi okay and there are

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.240 
that one with Luigi okay and there are
going<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.850> be<00:02:39.910> two<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.270> those<00:02:40.570> for<00:02:40.900> each<00:02:41.250> level

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
going to be two of those for each level

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.670 
going to be two of those for each level
or<00:02:42.880> each<00:02:43.090> area<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.750> mean<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:47.110> we're<00:02:47.350> only<00:02:47.470> gonna

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
time which is what I will be doing a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.410 
time which is what I will be doing a
little<00:03:17.019> bit<00:03:17.140> off-camera<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.250> also<00:03:18.820> lovely<00:03:19.269> up

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
little bit off-camera and also lovely up

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.330 
little bit off-camera and also lovely up
relatively<00:03:20.049> quickly<00:03:20.350> even<00:03:20.739> though<00:03:20.890> there<00:03:21.190> are

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
relatively quickly even though there are

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.810 
relatively quickly even though there are
some<00:03:21.670> better<00:03:21.910> places<00:03:22.329> but<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.110> just<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
some better places but this is just the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.509 
some better places but this is just the
quickest<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.150> most<00:03:25.299> convenient<00:03:26.220> I'm<00:03:27.220> going

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
are two ways to get to the area and I'm

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.110 
are two ways to get to the area and I'm
just<00:03:44.780> gonna<00:03:45.019> skip<00:03:45.349> these<00:03:45.530> two<00:03:45.829> out<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.700> peep

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
just gonna skip these two out of a peep

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.199 
just gonna skip these two out of a peep
people<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.200> they<00:03:48.739> will<00:03:48.950> throw<00:03:49.790> these<00:03:49.970> laser

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
people and they will throw these laser

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.849 
people and they will throw these laser
beams<00:03:50.510> at<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:50.989> teleport<00:03:51.439> randomly

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
can see and then of course the save box

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.500 
can see and then of course the save box
is<00:04:04.250> added<00:04:04.879> right<00:04:05.349> there<00:04:06.349> here<00:04:06.560> there<00:04:06.769> are<00:04:06.950> many

here with the save right there but until

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:51.950 
here with the save right there but until
then

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
next video will be probably the most
