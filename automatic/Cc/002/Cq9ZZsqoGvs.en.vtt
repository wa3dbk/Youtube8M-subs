and<00:00:46.850> some<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.629> little<00:00:47.899> bit<00:00:48.079> more<00:00:48.489> advanced

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
and some a little bit more advanced

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.759 
and some a little bit more advanced
movements<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.149> assemble<00:00:50.989> them<00:00:51.019> put<00:00:51.620> them

movements and assemble them put them

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.790 
movements and assemble them put them
together<00:00:52.039> in<00:00:52.640> what's<00:00:53.449> called<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.840> flow<00:00:54.289> so

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
together in what's called a flow so

you're going from one movement into

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.840 
you're going from one movement into
another<00:00:57.079> movement<00:00:57.410> into<00:00:57.800> maybe<00:00:58.219> even<00:00:58.429> a<00:00:58.579> third

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
another movement into maybe even a third

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.450 
another movement into maybe even a third
movement<00:00:59.210> and<00:00:59.600> it's<00:01:00.079> continuous<00:01:00.890> it's

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
movement and it's continuous it's

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.090 
movement and it's continuous it's
rhythmic<00:01:01.879> your<00:01:02.629> breathing<00:01:03.379> you're<00:01:03.679> you're
