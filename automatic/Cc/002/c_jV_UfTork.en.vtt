00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.809
 all his super-g allies have never been so popular 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:11.709

 never boring their share of canoe hysteria fans to valiant heart are 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.470
 back for the holidays 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.339
 for the fifth year in a row 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.460
 syllabus had to wait for the advent of the budokai tenkaichi series for the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.560
 license finally come all his noble letters 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.980
 dragonball z budokai tenkaichi 3 adds an extra lane to his 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.980
 intuition 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.460
 France does not have a solution in different ways 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.300
 its quality and popularity 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 its way of renewing itself but especially its longevity from this point of view 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.610
 moselle balloon is a champion all categories 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.790
 inexhaustible star seed because we have a lot of discord many of his 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.199
 acolytes on the tips of the nails 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.840
 At the end of each year, we are surprised to renew our car 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.570
 this year the suspect was decided to go a little further with regard to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.150
 the story mode, because now relying on all 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.830
 first adventures of his water when he is still a young boy 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.920
 naive and witty of the orient 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.230
 the opportunity for developers to update the cast of this 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.030
 third episode by proposing characters unpublished the outcome of this 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.410
 first season 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.720
 it is no longer worth presenting early not a straw it is not 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.330
 moved on the other hand unveiled the presence of the soul to tschannen 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.700
 tambourine or even blok we do the honor to represent the bastion of the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.660
 Red ribbon 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.670
 of course it is not the only new character of this dbz 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.070
 budokai tenkaichi 3 what does one count not less than 161 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.270
 belligerents against 130 last year 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.770
 about thirty new characters so that the developers went 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.200
 search here and there to continue to swell the ranks of this cast 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.150
 prestigious 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.120
 beyond an update in terms of distribution dragon ball z budokai 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.350
 tenkaichi 3 is also responsible for many improvements in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.590
 regards its gameplay 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.820
 of course the base remained an antique and that I propose once 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.170
 more his family 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.189
 which not only dynamically action cinematographically it 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.670
 retranscribes and asks the best year for the intensity that has 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 released from the series m 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.830
 it's all the system of combos and teleportation been reviewed and corrected 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.439
 in this version at the front at the college or even more opportunities to attacked 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.700
 while keeping some accurate on his victim the theft of the balloon up 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.969
 present limited to one single direction sophie side wider to 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.229
 horizons from now on it is possible to rush on his opponent from different 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.439
 sides 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.249
 stubborn is simply to compose an attack while keeping his speed 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.119
 cruising 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.230
 better yet we are lying to the square button on the triangle button 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.129
 when one is at a distance sufficiently close to the opponent 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.710
 is possible to attack him directly 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.710
 without ever breaking the fluidity of his movement 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.139
 so as not to favor the attacking days for the developers have 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 also left a wide range of moments wide enough to the defender so he 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.299
 can come out of delicate situations 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.459
 so by pressing the key it is possible to teleport in the back 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.470
 of his opponent 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.629
 to then find himself in the role of the assailant 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.349
 but only if we can take advantage of the situation 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.870
 if the sequences of attacked and other fireballs have won in 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.859
 power and velocity it is the same power that have almost been 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.930
 all have redrawn while some developers would have been content to 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.560
 add a few attacks here and there to make illusion the studio spa 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.919
 and its clients case to rework together I attack for each of 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.919
 characters 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.110
 in addition to dynamic pyrotechnic effects draining circumstances 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.110
 those who appreciate things are likely to be served 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.770
 real success in dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi 2 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.770
 the mockery of this third episode decided to put aside all the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.459
 meaning exploration the rpg of the previous opus 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.539
 in order to focus solely on the aspect and combative to our greatest 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.459
 disarray 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.589
 forget so a man world that it was possible flying over the speed of sound 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.200
 here the scenario cut into several chapters 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.689
 each corresponding to different periods of the series 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.400
 to bring a narrative aspect to this succession of fights sometimes 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.369
 redundant designers had the good idea to directly integrate the 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:42.040
 cinematics in the heart of the game to do this will then need the button r3 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.560
 the joystick when the pictogram appears on the screen 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.700
 if not more than to advance the story 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.430
 whatever the state in which his character is 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.970
 like the old parts of the series mario boselli of any at 3dduo 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.629
 also its strength through its many modes of play a story mode 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.890
 a tournament mode its many variations 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.330
 my training a mode versus a shop and all the other bonuses do not 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.170
 finally asks that an online mode for dbz budokai tenkaichi for 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.170
 shine in society 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.489
 this is the case but only for version 10 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.469
 a great advantage but in all honesty we preferred to play it 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.399
 on the games side 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.849
 to gesticulate stupidly in front of his screen with the wiimote and the nunchuk 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.809
 you will understand it dbz budokai tenkaichi 3 continues the tradition 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:21.739
 started in 2005 by renewing its lovers its gameplay and bringing 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.159
 some novelties here and there to make us want to succumb to 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.199
 call a third time 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.699
 he ate are you 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:29.460
 17 out of 20
