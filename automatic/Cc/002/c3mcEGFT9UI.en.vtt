great kit I have built it a few times
each<00:02:24.849> one<00:02:25.239> I've<00:02:25.510> done<00:02:25.689> a<00:02:25.720> little<00:02:26.079> bit

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
each one I've done a little bit

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.910 
each one I've done a little bit
differently<00:02:26.769> in<00:02:27.159> fact<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.700> have<00:02:27.879> one<00:02:28.709> right<00:02:29.709> now

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
differently in fact I have one right now

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.610 
differently in fact I have one right now
that<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:31.030> constructed<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.989> interior

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that is that I constructed the interior

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.280 
that is that I constructed the interior
completely<00:02:33.390> however<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.480> haven't<00:02:34.870> done<00:02:34.989> any<00:02:35.200> of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
completely however I haven't done any of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.920 
completely however I haven't done any of
the<00:02:35.409> body<00:02:35.650> painting<00:02:36.189> yet<00:02:36.430> I'll<00:02:37.060> probably<00:02:37.659> go

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
the body painting yet I'll probably go

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.330 
the body painting yet I'll probably go
with<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.109> darker<00:02:40.319> darker<00:02:41.319> metal<00:02:41.709> color<00:02:42.010> for
