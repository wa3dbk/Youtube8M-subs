00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.930
 Do you agree that it will not chat 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.000
 best option for Spartacus 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.130
 strongly disagree as a person 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.730
 who wants to see quality 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:23.020
 good and effective football 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.439
 but what is the concept for today's match 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.899
 best option 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.509
 I thought they wouldn't figure it out on advice 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.239
 directors and here it is hardly possible at all 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.730
 to talk about the fact that one figure is more 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.890
 the trainer is more inexperienced just 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.719
 flew out with his team you see 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.670
 obvious advantages which deer 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.920
 noglyki on Russian language of course 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.410
 Spartak CSKA I passed it is important for Spartacus 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.109
 because hiccuping is quite obvious 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.170
 turned out to be a completely foreign body 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.079
 I see no advantages but perhaps 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.280
 the fact that Jacob did not speak about him 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.949
 private conversation invented territory 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.090
 don't know who exactly 1 if 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.080
 leadership to allah his jazz maurin 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 did spartak need 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.799
 a year later to change the coach controversial issue 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 and here we unfortunately do not know the answers 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.040
 to the most important questions that will allow 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.020
 we reach an understanding 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.420
 no one can say that he understands 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.780
 What is now wanted Spartacus he who 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.049
 going to go and what are set 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.000
 leave its owners withdrawn we do not 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.940
 we know whether it was necessary to change Spartak 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.460
 a year later or a little more 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.530
 CEO we don't know need 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 did spartak change leadership 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.850
 board of directors 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.890
 we really do not know much and as long as we do not 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.390
 get answers to these questions who 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.580
 really runs in spartacus 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.330
 Of course, we can't talk about what 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.990
 should be on dismissal training 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.049
 Askhabadze 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.080
 this is the right step i think is not poor 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.869
 step after the team there to one 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.970
 wreck after another as th General 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.280
 director feeds on front page 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.110
 the leading sports edition is awesome 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.940
 his interview in which 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.330
 fences off all those problems 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.480
 which the team did not have 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.420
 appointment to stay it was already not 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.069
 right 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.220
 what do you expect from deer what most 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.790
 soon have similar steps 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.380
 Polish statements of different stories about 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.799
 slinging lace style 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.040
 Spartak spirit and about all that 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.109
 modern try a little relationship 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.269
 I personally do not expect anything since March 20 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.889
 crankcase 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.650
 somehow it becomes clear who is in this boat 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.670
 where rowing who for what answers that 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.980
 generally going on 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.280
 will they bet on the Russians on 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.909
 young Russians will be looking for foreigners 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.629
 level 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:08.700
 at least keep thrummed 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.849
 fog and weights you still owe nothing to them 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.609
 Spartak will be more interesting for you 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.560
 Of course, you can laugh a lot 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.680
 joke about Spartacus you 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.480
 use very much and let them not be offended 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.689
 Spartak fan is on me now 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.669
 but a year ago we saw how good 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.349
 developing team infrastructure 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.349
 exhibited in rfpl 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.169
 as deer than we will see through 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.889
 courtyard through two sports from gift fnl and 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.870
 would say it is necessary and in fnl better there is a kerala 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.370
 such good information 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.920
 I'm interested in Spartak and not some 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.500
 individuals by day and all these 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.319
 conversations about your own, alien and legend 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.349
 no legend all this 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.120
 and some thought such an artist 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.849
 how many years alenchik will work in the post 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.069
 Spartak head coach now nobody 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.220
 does not know expelled in disgrace Alenichev 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.080
 in half a year or he spend whole there 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.849
 cells by 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.970
 there is a huge chain of accidents 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:16.229
 which predict so everything is pretty 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.430
 probably forgot in the first division 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.139
 but then again we do n’t know what to talk about 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.910
 what will be the team who will play 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.910
 where so far until they are not completely 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.840
 understand to help him samand 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.550
 main prize 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.510
 when Spartak becomes champion again 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.270
 Russia question well yes the answer in which 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.940
 I can think now for a very long time I don’t think 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.060
 what's worth waiting for the next three years cooler 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.550
 now nobody told us about it but 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.520
 what needs to be done how exactly is it 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.900
 calm down and understand that 13 years chris 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.900
 titles just do not happen
