00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.960 
I mean it's cool that like you guys can
only<00:06:00.840> run<00:06:01.139> for<00:06:01.410> so<00:06:01.560> long<00:06:01.740> it's<00:06:02.010> time<00:06:02.070> realistic

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
only run for so long it's time realistic

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.080 
only run for so long it's time realistic
