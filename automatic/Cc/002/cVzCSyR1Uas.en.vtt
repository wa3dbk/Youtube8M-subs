00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.840
 hello very good kids and girls I am 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.120
 meeting see v2 and good today I'm going to 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.490
 teach how I shoot the penalties is a 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.290
 very simple way more than anything to 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.029
 that the ball does not leave the goal 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.210
 good for it we are going to go to the field 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.520
 training to teach you how good 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.970
 You know, I guess if you press the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.800
 crosshead throw 'aces' a shot from where 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.720
 is the ball at that moment in this 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.059
 case is a fault I do not do it for 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.580
 show how good it is made 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.050
 Well I've been a little bit a little bit 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.480
 bad but good we're going to what we 're going 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.180
 is to the penalties for it because what 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.350
 same when the ball is inside the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.840
 area we put the ball in the area 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.360
 we press the crosshead that is this button and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.570
 well let's go to let's throw for 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.300
 we press the button that is the button 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.880
 shot we go and we load between two or three 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.420
 bars just when you're in the green and 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.420
 then we press and and the address 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.140
 and we keep going, you see that so 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.270
 I shoot for the left 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.630
 you can adjust it much more to the stick 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.090
 giving it before good enough that already as 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 you see or where you want to throw 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.750
 but good as you can see the ball is 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.460
 difficult to get out of the goal of 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.950
 this good way again we press the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.080
 crosshead and let's throw it this time towards 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 the right side is worth you see that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.490
 pressing the Greek and the right side 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.640
 you leave, you leave in that direction 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.130
 and not and they do not miss the ball worth 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.580
 well I'm going to try one more extra for 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.289
 left again good again because you see is 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.319
 pretty easy, I hope I have 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.539
