 Hi, people who help in the literary and today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.850
 I came to talk to you about the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.410
 total darkness without skin stars 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.120

 appearing here on the small screen side in this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.289
 Civic exact moment arrived of their 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.480
 letters on the 30th or 31st of April 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 at the end of the month and a garden on the first 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 week of May so it was a read 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 super fast and when it arrived I got it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 I started reading the same day I was 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.090
 very anxious this book besides being 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.910
 beautiful aesthetically beautiful is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 wonderful also stf writing who 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 It's wonderful, I did not know, I did not know. 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.820
 that was so good, huh? 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.379
 I have an idea because after all 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 I've already watched a lot of movies. 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.930
 inspired by books of em gent an 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.420
 idea of how split which theme 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 that he used to explore so I went 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.879
 for this book that reaches expectations and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.500
 they were all achieved then this 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.329
 book is a book of short stories actually in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 34 points 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.250
 the first tale 1922 the second is the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 giant of the steering wheel the third extension 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 fair and the fourth a wedding 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.869
 The first tale to plot is then 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.110
 respect for a father who together with the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.170
 Son has a garlic taco to murder. 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.270
 the mother because of money matters 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.479
 of inheritance after all the wife 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.549
 he has just inherited 100 hectares and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.040
 land and he really wants to get the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.040
 secretaries and increase by making leaving 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.740
 but however disagrees with this then the plot 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.710
 all around him trying to coerce one 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 son né convinced son persuaded ua 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.659
 finally kill the wife stay with 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 those lands but the plot goes very 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 furthermore it shows the life of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.490
 leasing 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.490
 so many years and even after 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.590
 happened and it's very very interesting 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.479
 so it was an incredible tale 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 the second giant point of the steering wheel was 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.530
 one of my favorites 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.810
 despite being one of the heaviest 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.140
 in my opinion it was for me it 's the most 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.860
 well written but it is well crafted and had 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.370
 that's the end of it 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.250
 in the end fabulous and I found it very good 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.550
 Fantastic 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.730
 yes, it's giving shivers is to make you 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.670
 to be uncomfortable troubled with 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.070
 The story is very good, very good. 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.500
 respect for a girl from morning to 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.720
 leagues writer who is invited to 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.400
 give a talk in a nearby town 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.270
 she and she go by car 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 but in the middle of that road, it ends there 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.959
 being raped by an expensive driver in the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.590
 road and after the rape 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.530
 much happens and it solves in 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.020
 that she will take courage will take revenge 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.920
 so you imagine what will happen 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.040
 in history 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.570
 after the horrible part happens what 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.530
 she will do it to get revenge 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.630
 Fantastic 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.060
 already the fair contestation he speaks of a 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.900
 man that he is sick very sick 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.550
 I think the mouth you right and it ends 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.640
 finding in the middle of the road a 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.590
 hawker so he sells nothing 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.880
 more than extensions it sells 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.459
 extensions of hair extensions of several 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.640
 things including life 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.459
 So he switches he makes a sale to 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.799
 this boy who is sick with cancer 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.130
 it comes from an extension of life for him 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:34.239
 and give you more years for this guy to live 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.269
 however in exchange for some terrible means in 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.010
 exchange of pushing this evil that he is 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.400
 suffering this disease, right? 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.500
 in the form of bad for someone else then it is 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.750
 a fantastic story the premise is 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.670
 very good, very cool , so I'm already 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.280
 when I heard about it without looking 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.799
 to the doré and what to know what will happen 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.530
 there with this exchange they made this 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.530
 last point sale was my second 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.360
 favorite actually lies between the giant 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.110
 of the wheel and a good marriage 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.690
 this tale a good marriage is incredible 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.120
 It's also very good because it's very 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.300
 well heck so it 's things are very 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.510
 well tied up so it's very 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.970
 Son, can you compare this to 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.430
 things day to day it is that can 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.740
 happen in inclusive even after reading in 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.450
 end of the book has an epilogue and 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.390
 after reading the author's opinion on 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.060
 this tale and to have already said that 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.530
 was even based on a story in a 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.300
 actual situation 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.520
 then I was more impressed because 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.580
 really these things happen 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.770
 it is respect of a snow couple is already 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.400
 married 20 years ago almost 30 years 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:51.030
 married and wife entering the garage 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:53.730
 and find a few hidden objects from the 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.740
 husband there when she is traveling 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.530
 discovers a facet of her husband that she 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.660
 never ever imagined 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.420
 they have a perfect wedding full of 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.360
 love with children and a marriage full of 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.470
 companionship and friendship and without many 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.870
 years and she discovers a terrible secret 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.540
 so deadly about her husband 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.100
 and then they'll have to figure it out, right? 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.890
 during this account they will have to 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.160
 figure out a way around this 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.500
 anyway I can not talk too much in the game 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.630
 of spain is more was one of my tales 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.150
 Also, the giant's favorite 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.419

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.880
 written very well then 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.620
 I loved the crimes and violence that 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.680
 happens here in this book are well 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.260
 brutalis well a wide open so to 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.780
 who wants to see and tastes good in the face 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.210
 so I would not recommend it to anyone who does not 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.860
 Likes to read about crimes or violence 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.370

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.390
 although I have already watched some movies 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.120
 I think the books are fantastic. 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.290
 Even I'm going to start trying to read more. 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.500

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.110

 my childhood was the kit the thing is 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.480
