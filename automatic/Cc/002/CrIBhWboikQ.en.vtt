00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:26.289 
haven't learned yet question number
three<00:01:24.380> Nick<00:01:24.889> asks<00:01:25.340> do<00:01:25.549> you<00:01:25.609> think<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:25.850> Kabira

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
three Nick asks do you think that Kabira

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.029 
three Nick asks do you think that Kabira
is<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:26.600> an<00:01:26.719> avatar<00:01:26.990> universe<00:01:27.560> version<00:01:27.829> of

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
is like an avatar universe version of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.800 
is like an avatar universe version of
Hitler<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.609> definitely<00:01:29.539> think<00:01:29.600> she's<00:01:29.780> a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
Hitler I definitely think she's a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.169 
Hitler I definitely think she's a
fascist<00:01:30.289> so<00:01:30.499> I<00:01:30.530> would<00:01:30.740> say<00:01:30.859> yeah<00:01:31.069> plus<00:01:31.909> if<00:01:32.060> you

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
fascist so I would say yeah plus if you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.819 
fascist so I would say yeah plus if you
look<00:01:32.329> at<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> lot<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.659> her<00:01:32.840> troops<00:01:33.139> visually

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
look at a lot of her troops visually

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.469 
look at a lot of her troops visually
they're<00:01:34.159> inspired<00:01:34.609> by<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.789> lot<00:01:34.939> of<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.149> Nazi

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
they're inspired by a lot of the Nazi

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.660 
they're inspired by a lot of the Nazi
storm<00:01:35.780> troopers<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.799> could<00:01:36.950> also<00:01:37.100> say<00:01:37.369> Star

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
storm troopers you could also say Star

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.190 
storm troopers you could also say Star
Wars<00:01:37.880> stormtroopers<00:01:38.479> but<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.810> think<00:01:39.020> there's<00:01:39.139> a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
Wars stormtroopers but I think there's a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.139 
Wars stormtroopers but I think there's a
stronger<00:01:39.499> link<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:39.920> traditional<00:01:40.399> fascism<00:01:40.999> the

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
stronger link to traditional fascism the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.059 
stronger link to traditional fascism the
next<00:01:41.719> step<00:01:41.899> would<00:01:42.079> be<00:01:42.139> her<00:01:42.319> kicking<00:01:42.619> everyone

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
next step would be her kicking everyone

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.559 
next step would be her kicking everyone
out<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.369> earth<00:01:43.520> Empire<00:01:43.789> that<00:01:44.209> doesn't<00:01:44.479> bow

out of the earth Empire that doesn't bow

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.599 
out of the earth Empire that doesn't bow
down<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.810> her<00:01:45.079> like<00:01:45.709> expelling<00:01:46.130> them<00:01:46.310> from<00:01:46.369> her

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
down to her like expelling them from her

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.340

to<00:03:02.489> air<00:03:02.640> temple<00:03:03.060> Island<00:03:03.450> she<00:03:03.690> was<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.930> secret

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
to air temple Island she was in secret

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.020 
to air temple Island she was in secret
training<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.159> Southern<00:03:05.430> Water<00:03:05.459> Tribe

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
training in the Southern Water Tribe

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.670 
training in the Southern Water Tribe
she<00:03:06.510> basically<00:03:06.659> been<00:03:07.049> doing<00:03:07.200> nothing<00:03:07.440> but

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
she basically been doing nothing but

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.800 
she basically been doing nothing but
training<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.459> whole<00:03:08.640> time<00:03:08.849> if<00:03:09.359> she<00:03:09.540> had<00:03:09.629> done

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
training that whole time if she had done

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.910 
training that whole time if she had done
that<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.049> think<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.409> battle<00:03:10.650> would<00:03:10.739> have<00:03:10.859> gone

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
that I think the battle would have gone

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.190 
that I think the battle would have gone
very<00:03:11.129> differently<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.909> think<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.720> having<00:03:13.079> her

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
very differently I think in having her

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.990 
very differently I think in having her
lose<00:03:13.440> what<00:03:13.739> Mike<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.040> Bryan<00:03:14.280> wanted<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.790> say

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
lose what Mike and Bryan wanted to say

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.789 
lose what Mike and Bryan wanted to say
is<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.599> she's<00:03:15.900> not<00:03:16.049> going<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.379> be<00:03:16.470> able<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
is that she's not going to be able to

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.830 
is that she's not going to be able to
win<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.159> battle<00:03:17.370> against<00:03:17.849> kuvira<00:03:18.269> without

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
win a battle against kuvira without

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.569 
win a battle against kuvira without
killing<00:03:19.290> her<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.919> she'll<00:03:20.099> have<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.430> go<00:03:20.519> to

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
killing her like she'll have to go to

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.129 
killing her like she'll have to go to
the<00:03:20.700> Avatar<00:03:21.030> State<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.450> she's<00:03:21.780> not<00:03:21.959> gonna<00:03:22.049> be

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
the Avatar State and she's not gonna be

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.960 
the Avatar State and she's not gonna be
able<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.560> do<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.829> just<00:03:23.099> because<00:03:23.340> she<00:03:23.639> thinks

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
able to do that just because she thinks

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.940 
able to do that just because she thinks
that<00:03:24.180> she<00:03:24.419> is<00:03:24.450> another<00:03:24.780> version<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.200> her<00:03:25.410> so

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
that she is another version of her so

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.069 
that she is another version of her so
she<00:03:26.040> doesn't<00:03:26.250> want<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.519> kill<00:03:26.730> herself<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.959> when

yes<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.760> does<00:04:14.910> suck<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:15.359> there<00:04:15.690> are<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> lot<00:04:15.989> of

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
yes it does suck but there are a lot of

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.900 
yes it does suck but there are a lot of
TV<00:04:16.289> shows<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.680> have<00:04:17.039> continued<00:04:17.669> on<00:04:17.760> in<00:04:17.880> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
TV shows that have continued on in the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.210 
TV shows that have continued on in the
comics<00:04:18.359> like<00:04:18.720> Smallville<00:04:19.199> did<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.680> next<00:04:20.070> season

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
comics like Smallville did a next season

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.129 
comics like Smallville did a next season
in<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.639> comics<00:04:21.030> Buffy<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.720> Vampire<00:04:21.750> Slayer

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
in the comics Buffy the Vampire Slayer

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.050 
in the comics Buffy the Vampire Slayer
did<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.650> same<00:04:22.830> thing<00:04:23.130> Korra<00:04:23.700> could<00:04:23.880> do<00:04:23.969> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
did the same thing Korra could do the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.820 
did the same thing Korra could do the
same<00:04:24.180> thing<00:04:24.390> too<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.780> think<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.530> actual

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
same thing too I think the actual

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.020 
same thing too I think the actual
stories<00:04:26.190> they<00:04:26.340> end<00:04:26.430> up<00:04:26.490> writing<00:04:26.700> will<00:04:26.909> be<00:04:26.940> a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
stories they end up writing will be a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.390 
stories they end up writing will be a
little<00:04:27.210> bit<00:04:27.419> smaller<00:04:27.750> like<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.140> books

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
little bit smaller like the books

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.830 
little bit smaller like the books
they've<00:04:28.550> written<00:04:28.669> for<00:04:28.940> Last<00:04:29.090> Airbender<00:04:29.300> like

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
they've written for Last Airbender like

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.140 
they've written for Last Airbender like
the<00:04:30.020> collected<00:04:30.560> works<00:04:30.710> like<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.580> search<00:04:31.820> the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
the collected works like the search the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.879 
the collected works like the search the
promise<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.750> rift<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.229> think<00:04:33.530> it'll<00:04:33.650> be<00:04:33.770> more

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
promise the rift I think it'll be more

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.710 
promise the rift I think it'll be more
like<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.520> mean<00:04:35.000> as<00:04:35.150> long<00:04:35.330> as<00:04:35.479> there's<00:04:35.660> a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
like that I mean as long as there's a

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.719 
like that I mean as long as there's a
new<00:04:36.020> arc<00:04:36.290> a<00:04:36.500> new<00:04:36.650> story<00:04:36.949> you<00:04:37.250> can<00:04:37.400> view<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.580> as

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
new arc a new story you can view that as

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.879 
new arc a new story you can view that as
a<00:04:37.880> new<00:04:38.030> season<00:04:38.389> so<00:04:38.630> technically<00:04:39.199> it<00:04:39.590> might<00:04:39.770> be

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
a new season so technically it might be

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.189 
a new season so technically it might be
the<00:04:40.039> last<00:04:40.160> season<00:04:40.789> on<00:04:40.970> TV<00:04:41.479> but<00:04:41.780> it's<00:04:41.930> not<00:04:42.080> the

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
the last season on TV but it's not the

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.200 
the last season on TV but it's not the
last<00:04:42.350> season<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.830> Korra<00:04:43.039> ever<00:04:43.280> question

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
last season of Korra ever question

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.790 
last season of Korra ever question
number<00:04:44.389> 8<00:04:44.539> dawn<00:04:44.930> asks<00:04:45.139> do<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.590> think<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
number 8 dawn asks do you think the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.590 
number 8 dawn asks do you think the
kuvira<00:04:46.220> had<00:04:46.370> good<00:04:46.550> intentions<00:04:46.850> when<00:04:47.449> do<00:04:47.509> you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
kuvira had good intentions when do you

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.840 
kuvira had good intentions when do you
think<00:04:47.750> she<00:04:47.840> went<00:04:47.930> wrong<00:04:48.199> so<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.100> think<00:04:49.370> she

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
think she went wrong so I think she

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.770 
think she went wrong so I think she
definitely<00:04:50.060> started<00:04:50.449> out<00:04:50.539> with<00:04:50.660> good

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
definitely started out with good

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.240 
definitely started out with good
intentions<00:04:50.840> she<00:04:51.440> did<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.680> core<00:04:51.889> thing<00:04:52.130> where

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
intentions she did the core thing where

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.890 
intentions she did the core thing where
she<00:04:52.370> just<00:04:52.550> wrote<00:04:52.850> in<00:04:53.030> gung-ho<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.720> tried<00:04:53.870> to

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
she just wrote in gung-ho and tried to

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.810 
she just wrote in gung-ho and tried to
solve<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.229> problem<00:04:54.259> there<00:04:55.070> was<00:04:55.190> chaos<00:04:55.490> all

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
solve the problem there was chaos all

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.100 
solve the problem there was chaos all
over<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.150> earth<00:04:56.270> Kingdom<00:04:56.300> so<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.780> think<00:04:56.870> that

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
over the earth Kingdom so I think that

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.930 
over the earth Kingdom so I think that
her<00:04:57.229> solution<00:04:57.560> involved<00:04:58.190> just<00:04:58.280> completely

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
her solution involved just completely

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.420 
her solution involved just completely
replacing<00:04:59.600> their<00:04:59.930> order<00:05:00.259> with<00:05:00.530> hers<00:05:00.830> that's

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
replacing their order with hers that's

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.920 
replacing their order with hers that's
what<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.699> contracts<00:05:02.180> are<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.570> know<00:05:02.660> you<00:05:02.720> do

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
what the contracts are you know you do

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.779 
what the contracts are you know you do
everything<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:03.680> way<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:03.830> tell<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.490> do<00:05:04.639> it

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
everything the way I tell you to do it

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.969 
everything the way I tell you to do it
or<00:05:04.970> else<00:05:05.389> I<00:05:05.720> think<00:05:06.139> that<00:05:06.410> started<00:05:06.710> in<00:05:06.830> Ba<00:05:06.949> Sing

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
or else I think that started in Ba Sing

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.350 
or else I think that started in Ba Sing
se<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.400> think<00:05:07.669> that<00:05:07.789> they<00:05:07.880> wrote<00:05:08.030> in<00:05:08.210> there

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
se I think that they wrote in there

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.270 
se I think that they wrote in there
first<00:05:08.720> that<00:05:09.260> would<00:05:09.470> be<00:05:09.590> where<00:05:09.830> things<00:05:10.100> went

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
first that would be where things went

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.820 
first that would be where things went
wrong<00:05:10.370> she<00:05:10.820> equalized<00:05:11.720> everyone<00:05:12.229> in<00:05:12.470> a<00:05:12.650> very

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
wrong she equalized everyone in a very

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.129 
wrong she equalized everyone in a very
Amman<00:05:13.190> type<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.669> way<00:05:13.880> it<00:05:14.240> just<00:05:14.300> didn't<00:05:14.900> have<00:05:15.020> to

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
Amman type of way it just didn't have to

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.140 
Amman type of way it just didn't have to
do<00:05:15.260> with<00:05:15.410> bending<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:15.919> not<00:05:16.070> bending<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:17.090> if
