00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
okay they would have made another

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.939 
okay they would have made another
$10,000<00:00:53.989> but<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.260> preventative

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
$10,000 but you know preventative

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.270 
$10,000 but you know preventative
maintenance<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:57.500> want<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> blow<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> hose<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.190> an

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.959 
maintenance I want to blow a hose on an
interstate<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> am<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
interstate and then there I am so the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.649 
interstate and then there I am so the
next<00:01:03.180> thing<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.500> doing<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.830> because

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
next thing is doing all this because

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.910 
next thing is doing all this because
thermostat<00:01:06.659> isn't<00:01:06.840> working<00:01:07.320> properly<00:01:07.350> its

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
thermostat isn't working properly its

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.450 
thermostat isn't working properly its
engines<00:01:08.670> actually<00:01:09.000> running<00:01:09.180> too<00:01:09.479> cold<00:01:10.460> like

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
engines actually running too cold like

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.420 
engines actually running too cold like
1012<00:01:12.000> degrees<00:01:12.119> colder<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.040> it<00:01:14.040> keeps<00:01:14.220> going

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
1012 degrees colder and it keeps going

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
1012 degrees colder and it keeps going
on<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> warm<00:01:14.880> up<00:01:15.030> cycle<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> need<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
on to a warm up cycle so I need to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.700 
on to a warm up cycle so I need to
replace<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.110> thermostat<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
replace my thermostat that is going to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.660 
replace my thermostat that is going to
be<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> hell<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.220> job<00:01:24.770> can't<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.369> but

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
be a hell of a job can't really see but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.390 
be a hell of a job can't really see but
this<00:01:27.140> lower<00:01:28.140> radiator<00:01:28.560> hose<00:01:28.650> goes<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this lower radiator hose goes all the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.550 
this lower radiator hose goes all the
way<00:01:29.490> down<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.920> all<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.549> there

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
way down in there all the way down there

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
way down in there all the way down there
so<00:01:34.560> guess<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> got<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> pull

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
so guess what I got to do I got to pull

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
so guess what I got to do I got to pull
the<00:01:36.270> intake<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> since<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.640> I'm

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the intake off so since I'm in there I'm

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.539 
the intake off so since I'm in there I'm
gonna<00:01:41.850> replace<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.570> hose<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
gonna replace that hose there because it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670 
gonna replace that hose there because it
ties<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> bottom<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.680> there's

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
ties down to the bottom and there's

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200 
ties down to the bottom and there's
another<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.670> side<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.909> can't

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
another one down on this side I can't

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.280 
another one down on this side I can't
really<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> right<00:01:48.899> now

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
really see it right now

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.219 
really see it right now
they<00:01:50.040> both<00:01:50.280> hook<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.049> might

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
they both hook up down there so I might

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.889 
they both hook up down there so I might
as<00:01:52.350> well<00:01:52.439> change<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.189> hoses<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
as well change so it's two hoses and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.280 
as well change so it's two hoses and
pick<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.189> intake<00:01:56.360> manifold<00:01:57.360> gasket

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
pick up a intake manifold gasket

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.330 
pick up a intake manifold gasket
probably<00:02:00.290> going<00:02:00.410> to<00:02:00.470> clean<00:02:00.680> up<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.920> intake<00:02:01.190> as

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
probably going to clean up the intake as

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.200 
probably going to clean up the intake as
good<00:02:01.520> as<00:02:01.610> possible<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:02.210> put<00:02:02.300> it<00:02:02.420> back<00:02:02.510> on<00:02:04.210> so

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
good as possible and put it back on so

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.100 
good as possible and put it back on so
I'll<00:02:05.420> probably<00:02:05.600> be<00:02:05.780> here<00:02:06.050> all<00:02:06.230> day<00:02:06.260> doing<00:02:06.590> this

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.680 

got<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.260> new<00:02:12.380> hose<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.480> hope<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.630> don't

engine<00:02:21.880> we've<00:02:22.880> got<00:02:23.060> these<00:02:23.270> on<00:02:26.290> when<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.410> do

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
engine we've got these on when you do

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.650 
engine we've got these on when you do
these<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.800> got<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.220> take<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:29.060> top<00:02:29.300> one<00:02:29.540> up

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
these you got to take this top one up

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.660 
these you got to take this top one up
first<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.770> can<00:02:30.920> get<00:02:31.070> down<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.460> other

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
first and you can get down to the other

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.570 
first and you can get down to the other
hose<00:02:32.000> clamp<00:02:32.360> real<00:02:32.600> easy<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.460> then<00:02:34.460> you

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
hose clamp real easy and then you

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.340 
hose clamp real easy and then you
basically<00:02:34.760> push<00:02:35.270> them<00:02:35.420> down<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.870> corner

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
basically push them down to the corner

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.290 
basically push them down to the corner
over<00:02:36.470> here<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.340> get<00:02:37.460> the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
over here and then you can get the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.830 
over here and then you can get the
bottom<00:02:38.660> clamp<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.710> bottom<00:02:40.700> hose<00:02:40.880> or<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
bottom clamp for the bottom hose or the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.150 
bottom clamp for the bottom hose or the
middle<00:02:42.170> hose<00:02:42.290> however<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.680> want<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.890> call<00:02:43.010> it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
middle hose however you want to call it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.420 
middle hose however you want to call it
once<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.240> hose<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.830> easier<00:02:46.220> to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
once that hose is out and it's easier to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.430 
once that hose is out and it's easier to
get<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.330> bottom<00:02:47.540> clamps<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.200> see

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
get to the bottom clamps you can see

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.440 
get to the bottom clamps you can see
them<00:02:48.530> down<00:02:48.680> there<00:02:51.760> now<00:02:52.760> they're<00:02:52.970> done<00:02:53.180> I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
them down there now they're done I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.970 
them down there now they're done I
expect<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:54.290> we'll<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.620> touch<00:02:54.800> those

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
expect that we'll have to touch those

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.080 
expect that we'll have to touch those
for<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> long<00:02:55.520> time<00:02:55.940> if<00:02:56.120> ever<00:02:57.730> I'm<00:02:58.730> gonna<00:02:58.910> start

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
for a long time if ever I'm gonna start

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.580 
for a long time if ever I'm gonna start
taking<00:02:59.240> apart<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.720> intake<00:03:00.020> next<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.350> turns

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
taking apart the intake next so it turns

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.620 
taking apart the intake next so it turns
out<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:04.280> I'm<00:03:04.520> going<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.940> tear<00:03:05.150> apart

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
out that I'm going to have to tear apart

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.870 
out that I'm going to have to tear apart
not<00:03:06.110> just<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.500> intake<00:03:06.980> but<00:03:07.550> I'm<00:03:07.640> gonna<00:03:07.760> have

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
not just the intake but I'm gonna have

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.880 
not just the intake but I'm gonna have
to<00:03:07.940> take<00:03:08.090> off<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.570> injectors<00:03:09.110> or<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.650> fuel

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
to take off the injectors or the fuel

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.500 
to take off the injectors or the fuel
rail<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.730> injectors<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.239> might<00:03:11.390> as<00:03:11.480> well

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
rail so the injectors I might as well

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.410 
rail so the injectors I might as well
pull<00:03:11.780> them<00:03:11.870> loose<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.440> replace<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.220> o-rings

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
pull them loose and replace the o-rings

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.600 
pull them loose and replace the o-rings
well<00:03:14.930> my<00:03:15.230> vehicles<00:03:15.680> been<00:03:15.860> burning<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.310> lot<00:03:16.430> of

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
well my vehicles been burning a lot of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.910 
well my vehicles been burning a lot of
oil<00:03:16.940> lately<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:17.450> mean<00:03:17.690> really<00:03:18.440> bad<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.890> a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
oil lately I mean really bad like a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.320 
oil lately I mean really bad like a
quart<00:03:19.520> every<00:03:19.790> thousand<00:03:20.450> miles<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.880> when<00:03:23.300> I

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
quart every thousand miles and when I

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.750 
quart every thousand miles and when I
smelled<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.900> fuel<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.650> smells<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.459> mean<00:03:25.610> when<00:03:25.730> I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
smelled the fuel it smells I mean when I

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.850 
smelled the fuel it smells I mean when I
smelled<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> oil<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.870> lipstick<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.530> smells

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
smelled the oil on lipstick it smells

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.880 
smelled the oil on lipstick it smells
like<00:03:28.040> fuel<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:29.330> my<00:03:29.600> guess<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.870> one<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.830> the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
like fuel so my guess is one of the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.270 
like fuel so my guess is one of the
injectors<00:03:31.370> isn't<00:03:31.670> firing<00:03:32.030> properly<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:33.380> I've

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
injectors isn't firing properly and I've

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.310 
injectors isn't firing properly and I've
been<00:03:34.730> checking<00:03:35.180> them<00:03:35.240> before<00:03:35.600> they're

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
been checking them before they're

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.949 
been checking them before they're
supposed<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.740> tick<00:03:37.070> some<00:03:37.490> tick<00:03:37.820> some<00:03:38.570> go<00:03:38.720> clunk

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
supposed to tick some tick some go clunk

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.510 
supposed to tick some tick some go clunk
clunk<00:03:39.200> clunk<00:03:39.260> while<00:03:39.620> some<00:03:39.800> go<00:03:39.920> tick<00:03:40.130> tick<00:03:40.310> tick

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
clunk clunk while some go tick tick tick

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.850 
clunk clunk while some go tick tick tick
tick<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.720> there's<00:03:41.900> definitely<00:03:42.050> some<00:03:42.350> some

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
tick so there's definitely some some

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.630 
tick so there's definitely some some
issue<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.250> on<00:03:43.430> there<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:46.310> instead<00:03:46.580> of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
issue going on there so instead of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.970 
issue going on there so instead of
getting<00:03:47.060> into<00:03:47.390> all<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.690> today<00:03:48.050> I'm<00:03:48.680> going<00:03:48.890> to

getting into all that today I'm going to
go<00:03:49.100> buy<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.310> intake<00:03:49.730> gasket<00:03:50.209> right<00:03:50.360> now<00:03:51.519> so

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
go buy the intake gasket right now so

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.840 
go buy the intake gasket right now so
then<00:03:52.700> I'm<00:03:53.860> opposed<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.950> bid<00:03:55.190> when<00:03:55.400> I've<00:03:55.610> got

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850

then I'm opposed to bid when I've got
when<00:03:56.120> I've<00:03:56.239> got<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.510> all<00:03:56.660> tore<00:03:56.870> down<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:58.130> then
