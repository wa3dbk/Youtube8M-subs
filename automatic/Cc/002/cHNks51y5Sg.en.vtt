 Hello and welcome the rails to 600 euros called between 6 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:06.630
 follow suit because we are always up to date 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.809
 and 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:09.769
 I am 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.029
 in fifth place is the most watched directors I had 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.120
 I do not jump sports 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.519
 45 that is 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.669
 over half 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:18.630
 of a hundred 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 I show today to Ivkic my text 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.599
 Jäggi percent in Spain could say exactly 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.570
 and to pick it up then we would yes that you have the link there is one 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.910
 Description and return to the church the yes-word 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.190
 Beaumont object percent here sports leaders the whole though not 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.970
 and then you click on the link then you submit window 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.510
 and then not just four percent 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.620
 To pay complaints 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.800
 the act then threatens me rocks great stuff 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.199
 and then this has this file Inc here with lid animals 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.070
 For the most part probably not start 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.020
 packed the GIS together and t 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.199
 the grievances had with revenue 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.830
 Program called if Raul also Wenzel Brothers the winemaker 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.970
 on average, will be even stronger than expected that in the penultimate game 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760
 if not enough 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.220
 and what conquerors in the case 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.100
 and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.240
 I'll just hit the rail when 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.450
 me if he does not care about it is on a small video percent 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 in order not to bear the facts and deeds by cost itself 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.570
 and also Thun's goalie - XP user it does not change anything 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.729
 a big whole 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.950
 and that's just different from design 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.720
 just then in Prague that had these tandems in the 2 there are then quite 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.620
 many folders coach with whom I can do nothing with him I can even 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.140
 do not start anything 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 right with the one here with a picture dapd but nothing more 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.290
 the party now wants one percent to join the Ellis Park community 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.560
 do and to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.380
 then they are allowed the animals 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.380
 info comrades and then bought up 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.799
 and then he gives one percent off the crater percent 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.690
 bring you a folder 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.760
 a the crime scene in Rome 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.800
 and the attacks started waiting bankrupt 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.680
 the nostril seeker stands somewhere and then you have process here 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:16.449
 and since Captain Lampertz this practice eg Welte to an impressive sprint 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.789
 Media out 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.199
 everyone brings in downstairs and then just gives 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.199
 then he puts just close Murat 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.549
 not so with 200 euros it's bad two I do not call well 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.009
 with an unnatural 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.939
 and then 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.290
 in percentages, the rural communities starts Kraft Standard Kerner 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.029
 Lulu 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.379
 Gaitán World Share 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:51.580
 starts here 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.739
 In the East, dancing minimized with the blacksmith works 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.049
 unsolicited the 70s why the dissidents thundered I will with mine 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.439
 Stop death 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.659
 By no means will I do that the problem is only life around when they move 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.519
 Not 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.299
 if the combo version is not always current crew version 1 2 2 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.299
 Point - Knut underlined 0 1 I think 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.049
 the format on alternate all patches Assmann future colored wool port 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.689
 and that hides all the trees, I could show you that now 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.669
 Must not be Malte not over yet thoroughly show and indeed critical 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.819
 can buy 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.239
 Percent of not now 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.650
 because they are the leaves of baking baked underfoot liability 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.599
 everything about almost 70 percent per dogged 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.669
 Next does not change anything 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:40.939
 percent 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.729
 Ellen 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.140
 exactly and that and above all else 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.270
 in the new world I have already flowed a neighbor with these words 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.209
 other that it too 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.359
 to order here continue to 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.449
 Möllinger copied open new waltz Eugene Jeter and that is quite funny 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.019
 trapped at the same time does so well as new 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.059
 which may sound strange to one or the other 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:05.769
 and I am I will be very much looking forward to it 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.929
 that would have to be corrected afterwards 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.799
 I do not know when 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.629
 that's exactly what percent 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.629
 immerse yourself in a new world 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.569
 hazards 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.569
 those days 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.569
 Fear right again 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.569
 at exactly the same time I try again 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.539
 The world could explore years ago they still have some new things to sing about 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.960
 Among other things were young and so it was that I have everything close again 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.319
 all of this has become more and more just too much thank you, I have everything 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.379
 still done today 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.460
 so it does not get that boring what to discover in new things 

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.669
 there and otherwise percent for whatever are striking with scared 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.020
 not and continue 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.970
 Every year, as always, I managed to forget something 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.430
 He does not see Jérôme 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.070
 I forgot to say that every year they apply their motto 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.070
 and if you have an older version of Microsoft 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.339
 Process will not work, Reporter will release the latest version of 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.210
 arrived Beta 1 of 2 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.210
 he did not need to continue me now I would be no blackmail for older 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.319
 Create version 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.990
 Per cent because latest version ever I support them 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.529
 does not stretch me 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.599
 um and percent of course, there are no horses at the moment but there are 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.309
 more alternative to the effect almost to come but that is the 1 it went 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.179
 I just wanted to say I knew that today and Werder only knew 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:36.809
 Organ turns 500 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:40.729
 Not because it's still on the Canucks estate 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.689
 In the middle of the cut again what will be but again but Hey you know 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.789
 I know that from me, I'm always so forgetful 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.789
 Percent chased the carpenter as well as the city he hides 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.180
 Fiat wants 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.229
 good percent so 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.629
 the 70 points 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.839
 we do not have any wonder for six other end wonder where I'm from 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.259
 Alban Meier I'm looking forward to it in any case 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.900
 and the rugged that goes into it and thus becomes more expensive 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.590
 and keep the game under control 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.039
 they postpone Michelle arrives on the 8th 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.389
 and please 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.279
 When I made her to Dr the first ride of the catfish first, she stepped here 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.990
 with the TT that would be because the arrives then come States 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.259
 so just that i said it and it really is about Offenberg detail 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.259
 When he first wrote this, the retiree could make a meaningful comment 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:31.569
 rudder 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.289
 omit the complete I do not want to complain because »it annoys me 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.370
 always i am always happy about comments 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.219
 «And there questions and over 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.300
 what is so striking and striking 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.749
 and then comes what he saw that city beats me on the bag 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:46.819
 good just that it is and when it's on the ring 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.360
 then ask me if however percent I stand 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.439
 as I said it will not be blocked otherwise 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.830
 Per cent yes and that's it a student thanks for the subscribers as I said 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.939
 meanwhile, next time
