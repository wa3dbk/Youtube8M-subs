00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:08.590
 if we're here in a how-to tutorial 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:13.150
 adjust the wheel how to make it turn and 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:16.000
 everything for people who do not know and 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.010
 Well, nothing, let's start, we hope for a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.250
 second that I remove all this from above 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.250
 who is doing homework and shits 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.540
 OK 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.830
 well nothing we are lame this 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.580
 first we have to do this is 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:46.030
 loosen the wheel is easy you have to 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:48.550
 do so and push vale or so 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.680
 is that with one hand I can not 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:58.950
 we wait a second why 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:05.040
 I 'll leave you now for a second if I look 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:09.090
 We loosens them and it turns more or less not 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.020
 des loosen challenged to forgive 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.020
 a little more 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.700
 and you are already looking 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:24.000
 the bad thing about this is that it has a game 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.250
 I do not know if you can see it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.260
 Well that is depends on the tastes because 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.330
 there are people who want it that way or tight to 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.940
 I like tight and axes too 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.970
 I do not know why it is I got used to it 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.200
 Nothing and then if you want to be 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:54.450
 so to tighten is the same is to do so 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.970
 put it like this between the screw and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:04.090
 You see, we do like this 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:09.410
 we press until we can not do more 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.890
 and you're now no longer see tour 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.780
 Well, I do not expect you to like a 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.790
 tutorial on how to adjust the axes and this 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.490
 It is one that you have already seen in others 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.210
