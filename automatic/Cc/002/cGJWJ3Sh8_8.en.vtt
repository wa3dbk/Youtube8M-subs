00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 Welcome greetings , we're going 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.250
 check out a top5 of products that cost 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.260
 expensive but worth every penny 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.030
 I do not know if there is such a video 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.889
 on youtube and did not even stop to search 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.379
 but it's been some time since I wanted to do 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.180
 This video for you because there are some 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.189
 even though there are not many who 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 I paid too much to invest 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.000
 enough money only that the vase for the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.580
 sorry I think we are valid 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.439
 indicating that whoever is reminding me 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.029
 accompanies a while I did not know there 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 I'm the type of blogger who lives 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.960
 wasted expensive brands and products not me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
 I live in the fair of my city. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.579
 including buying cheap clothes 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.860
 I use in my day-to-day and easy a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.110
 look at the day right on the blog for you and already 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.899
 there is a wide range of products that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.960
 are very expensive and are perfectly 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.570
 replaced by cheaper ones but 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.460
 there is a small group of products 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 electrical products you will not 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.379
 able to replace by the height that 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.989
 costs cheaper then was that kind of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.690
 thought was that kind of vain to say 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.549
 goal that I used to be able to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.549
 select these products that have entered 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.659
 in this top 5 issue of cost expensive not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.460
 cost expensive 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 is very relative will depend on each 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.700
 person and will also depend on the dunga of the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.409
 financial level that the person has 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.869
 so it's expensive for most of me 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.820
 of Brazilians who earn around 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.500
 a minimum wage is also expensive but 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.080
 all of a sudden some people who are 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 watching here has a better condition 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.659
 It does not cost as expensive as that, but it's 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 relative to the first one is that mark 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.140
 of the rondo brand 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.869
 This is a restorative mask or 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.220
 reconstruction and this mask is all 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.200
 good and a bit more 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.509
 almost a year ago I bought this brand and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.290
 it is not over yet and it rains for fast 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.240
 you 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.119
 she is super concentrated we a 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.009
 tea spoon that is the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 enough for long hair like 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.960
 my and she thinks super fast wash 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.750
 minutinhos five and his hair already okay with 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.780
 it's totally different then if your 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.299
 son is brittle burly 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.310
 leaving in several pieces is worth 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.560
 Worth your while to invest. 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.540
 This mask here gives so much good orange. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.550
 He sent I'll let all prices 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.860
 products here in the corner are every time 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.590
 that show the second thing is product 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.440
 that costs me dearly is this basis 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.720
 mac're this base is that of all 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.849
 fixed studio that is a base is a base 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.980
 so it has a high coverage 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.340
 It is a base that you have with 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.720
 spots on the skin if you have 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.300
 deep pimples under her eyes 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.610
 perfectly cover is a very 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.590
 good to record videos is a very 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 good for you to go out at night for a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.269
 special event because you get 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.730
 that skin of porcelain and stays 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.799
 that doll skin and I know indicates 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.690
 this base cost dear, how are you? 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.120
 can check the price 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.489
 I would buy again quietly 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.650
 when finished will be reserved there the 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.599
 money to buy another already sang in the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.940
 scholarship and I'm going to continue on Mac 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.430
 Mac's second thing that cost dear was 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.310
 this sponge that the very shape if the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.950
 you're checking here only 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.440
 it's worth you to keep every penny 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.260
 to buy because the application of bases 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.840
 is both liquid bases and base in 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.359
 cream is something else with this sponge that 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.340
 it gives a very natural finish 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.140
 eliminating those pores and those 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.959
 the basic traces that lie when people 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.510
 use your fingers or brush as the brush 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.100
 because he has several series, he finishes 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.290
 leaving one trail another that I 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.000
 especially I do not like I think 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.100
 This sponge solves this 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.350
 problem by finishing as I said 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.260
 for you natural a more natural sage 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.389
 possible to base your audience at last 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.489
 the room it still has my list 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:50.420

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.670

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:07.040
 purple communion and he has the best 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.739
 smell I've seen in my life is the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.209
 My favorite movie is that he is very strong. 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.590
 very striking 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.420
 it is a perfume that 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.000
 I want you to always follow me 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.889
 all life then why will you overcome 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.139
 It's worth your while to invest in that perfume. 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.030
 especially if you like 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.580

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.220
 He is very good, very good people. 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.669

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.560
 he is thus he has been receiving the 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:45.440
 which is kind in silver color and then you open it 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.260

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.660
 drops and the texture of it is as if 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.120

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.120

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.060
 wrinkles is and he has a good technology 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.600
 Nice, he's got a product called 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.130
 then the concentration rhamnose 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.080
 differentiated from the others than the 10 per 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.039
 one hundred percent from what I understand in surveys 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.350
 that I did 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.870
 is a very high concentration and beyond 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.539
 of serrano nuts and people talk like that 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.060
 also agronomic and agronomic that also 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.530
 filling substance and it serves 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.440
 for you to eliminate those first 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.450
 wrinkles know those lines of expression 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.789
 those fine lines even though it appears 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.620
