00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
probably wondering why there are holes

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300 
probably wondering why there are holes
in<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.170> big<00:02:31.500> hole<00:02:31.800> here<00:02:32.040> that's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
in there and this big hole here that's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.530 
in there and this big hole here that's
what<00:02:32.459> she<00:02:32.640> said<00:02:32.880> now<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.290> holds<00:02:35.220> these<00:02:36.209> holes

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
what she said now this holds these holes

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.320 
what she said now this holds these holes
here<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> speaker<00:02:37.920> as<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
here are for the speaker as you know the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.110 
here are for the speaker as you know the
speaker<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.810> my<00:02:40.770> phone<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> back

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
speaker of my phone is at the back

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.320 
speaker of my phone is at the back
so<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.629> flash<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.670> camera<00:02:45.180> itself

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
so it's the flash and the camera itself

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.710 
so it's the flash and the camera itself
so<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.379> at<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> back<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.190> that's<00:02:47.879> why<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.420> has

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so it's at the back so that's why it has

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.350 
so it's at the back so that's why it has
a<00:02:49.110> hole<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.830> there<00:02:50.129> so<00:02:50.640> whenever<00:02:50.909> you<00:02:51.120> want<00:02:51.299> to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.660 
a hole in there so whenever you want to
take<00:02:51.510> pictures<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.379> use<00:02:52.739> use<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.459> with
