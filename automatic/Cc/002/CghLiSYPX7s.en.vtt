00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.750
 for the 0.11 point zero we are in 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.179
 April 9 and well here we would change the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.680
 blocks or commands 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.330
 there are some books 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.580

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.720
 enter a world 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.720
 who is here 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.610
 what made me 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.830
 you have to laugh 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.830
 long ago what is this 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.180
 in web 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.540
 in this country 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.760
 we are doing that would be the cost of 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.430
 this for the review and good if you use 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.290
 the map handling videos of my video 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.200
 where he was and never his base of 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.489
 download is good then here we are in 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.960
 what would be the lucky review 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.400
 jacket so good let's see what 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.430
 it would be the creatures or the mods 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.730
 so let's go see them 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.580
 that we have here the wolf there are some 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.180
 books in the wolves 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.670
 Cow 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.370
 Here is the skeleton no skeleton 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.070
 so it's daytime so we're going to 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.070
 change what would be shit 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.810
 it's the clack 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 oh my god what's it worth I want to make a 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.500
 something guys 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.460
 because both the k 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.330
 Y 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.330
 if you are recording 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.960
 ok let's put what would be the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:56.850
 Hispanics that would be these 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.100
 the descriptor falls ill and is latent not 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.100
 we're going to tell him if he changes the texture of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.650
 everything that would be minecraft itself the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.440
 leander man also changes it 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.200
 you can see that he is happier now 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.710
 as happy the creever also the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.540
 changes and the bat also what 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.750
 we are also going to see what others would be 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.050
 modes like the squid the zombie fickman 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.660
 the zombie and we are going to face 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.100
 you can see there are too many 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.920
 things that change 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.280
 to see if the zombie zombie also what 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.930
 change I do not understand why it does not burn 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.840
 the wrong peak too 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.489
 the squid is squid we will see how 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.980
 Whatsapp 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.780
 also the change guys is amazing and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.159
 I want to see how I look at the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.730
 ue magma also changes it and well what 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.439
 typical of a texture of 64 by 64 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.810
 pixels is that they will always see the 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.700
 Gross flowers and beds to see 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.739
 kaka would be the plants and the woods 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.530
 how can you see the bugs but they are books 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.489
 minimums worth here would be what they would be 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.350
 the flowers the plants the crystal and as 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.120
 You can see some four books 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.950
 it's just the plants that have a 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.740
 diameter block 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.350
 the others if it continues normally here 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.250
 we will have what would be the globish with the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.870
 creeper and the tree is already had 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.810
 a structure that I do not know what is the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.990
 water also changes it guys so 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.870
 well let's see another side what 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.080
 would be the decoration blocks 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.110
 here we would have what we see ten 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.540
 creepers the fences are not these 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.230
 from the prisons the fences the wood the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.640
 cake the sponge the bookstore the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.000
 pumpkin alive stones 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.250
 the sword and this would be what would be the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.159
 half the reactor and so we would have 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.900
 much more things with berries would be 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.909
 the door 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.489
 this is not a door this is some 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.769
 trapdoors and well let's move on to what 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.379
 that would be the wool but without first seeing 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.190
 this would be like a kind of 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.370
 carpet 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.010
 the portal to the in the of the house on the table 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.280
 and crawling this I think it 's for 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.880
 the materials to get the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.850
 insularistas to the ovens the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.950
 that offers already we would have the wool that 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.310
 they really are pretty cool as if 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.220
 I'm out they need dad dad dad 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.009
 let's see what else would be my plus 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.400
 cobwebs there are 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.710
 the other thing that would be here the blocks of 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.360
 construction and we would end up with said 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.210
 review 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.150
 and here we would have what would be the 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.770
 blocks like that would be quartz I think 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:02.159
 that this is obsidian snow the ice and 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.310
 There is melted water of sandstone stone 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:09.569
 stone the stone with moss stone and I think 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.759
 that I do not know what stone brick and 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.110
 normal stone 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.020
 the art is quite ideal to make 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.759
 a house this I do not know what it will be worth 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:24.990
 Earth with its different forms of biome 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.939
 the sandstone the sand the gravel and the infra 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.009
 stone worth here we would have what 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:32.550
 would be the flowers as you can see the the 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:36.870
 coal with his gold and what the iron with 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:40.529
 its respective block the gold the diamond 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:43.379
 the lapis lazuli the remains and the emerald 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.389
 and there is also a book that would be the one of 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.639
 bed but guys the one in the bed is already a 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.660
 minimum book 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:56.190
 is a ship does not affect almost anything 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.860
 wait there are kids are just books 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.780
 minimal and good this would be all guys 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.360
 in the channel of the creator the twitter and the 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.500
 link will be in the description so 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.500
 good if it cost xiaochao 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.420
 what would the paintings be like 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.210
 you can see let's get them out 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.780
 you can see that they are pretty cool 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.780
 wow 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.300

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.820
