00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.410
 personal computer basically 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 used to connect to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.770
 scanner printer computer and other 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.540
 external devices can however 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.910
 be used for other purposes 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 organization of communication between the two

 remote signaling loss of control 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.460
 based on this standard 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.120
 is the employee interface 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.879
 and its extended version and networks have neither

 drink 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.670
 titles about this one are from 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.280
 standard device names 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.719
 printer is such a 1

 project accepted by terminals and nikolai 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:45.729
 adopted in the operating system 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.960
 ms dos family systems 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.650
 initially this sport was developed only 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.760
 for simplex none truth transmission 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.710
 data as it was assumed that 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 port citronix post 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.960
 use only to work with 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.040
 the printer is subsequently different 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.270
 firms have developed 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.390
 duplex permissions 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.440
 interface kids watching i have papayas 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.880
 and drink although was adopted by international 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.590
 its 12 8 4 standards describing how 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.300
 basic interfaces will touch it and all of it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.420
 extensions 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 port on the manager's side 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.049
 device computer has twenty five 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.080
 pin double row db 25 connector 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.750
 with my mom 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.840
 and e 12 8 4 a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.860
 on peripheral devices usually 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.040
 used 306 and pin plug 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.829
 citronix 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.060
 and I am 12 8 and 4 b 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.729
 so when and to connect 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.210
 computer peripherals 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.770
 on parallel imports 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.399
 usually performed at the institute contact 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.770
 25 gb connector 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.180
 mail us one side and thirty six 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.570
 contact her 12 8 4 b on the other and bcd it 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.070
 inclusion in the channel and some other 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.260
 devices use cable y 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.630
 which instead of the connector yen 12 8 4 in them 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.980
 mounted connector added 5 mm usually with 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.390
 the camera is equipped with a second interface with 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.389
 db connector 25 million or 12 8 4 a 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.189
 and connect the printer because 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.069
 usually the computer is equipped 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.169
 only one day, that is, if her 12 84 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.039
 The theme of scandal technique is built like this 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.199
 so that when working with a printer 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.459
 transparent scanner transmitted data from 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.249
 one interface to another 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.129
 when connecting the programmer to the CRB 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.529
 This interface, use the cable GB
