00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
like that so I don't even like to go

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
like that so I don't even like to go
toward<00:00:54.539> my<00:00:54.719> toes<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> to

toward my toes but I just want you to
think<00:00:56.579> about<00:00:56.940> maybe<00:00:57.149> moving<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
think about maybe moving more of a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
think about maybe moving more of a
positive<00:00:58.320> contraction<00:00:59.070> pressing<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.820> without

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
positive contraction pressing up without

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
positive contraction pressing up without
letting<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> front<00:01:00.960> legs<00:01:01.140> straighten<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
bring it back down and now you could do

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.399 
bring it back down and now you could do
it<00:01:04.830> without<00:01:04.920> holding<00:01:05.640> press<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> down

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it without holding press it up and down

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
it without holding press it up and down
and<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.710> such<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> great<00:01:08.220> exercise<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:08.820> quads

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and it's such a great exercise for quads

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
and it's such a great exercise for quads

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
could do it with your toes pointing

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.109 
could do it with your toes pointing
forward<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.040> usually<00:01:20.340> turn<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
forward I usually turn out because I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.460 
forward I usually turn out because I
really<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.750> into<00:01:21.900> my<00:01:22.049> inner<00:01:22.200> thighs

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
really like to get into my inner thighs

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.820 
really like to get into my inner thighs

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so if I'm in my side lunge I'm gonna set

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550 
so if I'm in my side lunge I'm gonna set
this<00:01:26.009> leg<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.390> bit<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> then

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this leg out a little bit more and then
