 welcome to a new video you know 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.930
 of the school of emotions of life in 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.360
 rosette today we are going to talk about the couple 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.050
 is a subject that I know that many already 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.660
 Many of you worry about how not to 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.000
 if how many people dream of finding 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.250
 soul mate who has not dreamed of any 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.190
 time to meet the love of his 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.160
 life is a precious dream is a goal 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.760
 great to have in life yet 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.850
 not all people serve to be 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.700
 in a couple or in a couple style we go 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.770
 to say traditional classic nor all the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.510
 Epochs of life are but 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.080
 regardless of what is important 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.180
 would be before entering into relationship with 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.850
 another person learn to be in 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.399
 relationship with ourselves is true 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.890
 that we fell in love with other people who 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.470
 at the beginning everything is beautiful because in 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.070
 the mutual moment that story is strong 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.259
 because it will be because we fall in love not with 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.630
 the light of that person but of our 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.070
 shadow of everything that we 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.020
 we have denied 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.880
 that we do not like in us and that 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.850
 we believe because we have forgotten 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.790
 we think we lack that, that's why we 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 we turn into orange stockings and 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.920
 we look for another half orange but of course 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 the half orange is not out there is 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.990
 here in here behind but nevertheless 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.140
 we look for it outside so that two 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.720
 people who have not learned to love each other 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.020
 themselves to get along with themselves 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.360
 to be accepted with their pluses and minus their 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.580
 advantages and their disadvantages or with those 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.310
 things that people call virtues and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.470
 flaws and then that other half 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.780
 denied of ourselves is what 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.729
 we look out there but look at the other 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.730
 part does the same then two get together 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.370
 people who carry a part of their 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.310
 so costs can not fit itself 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.290
 you have problems of a couple if you do not know 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.750
 why you put the other hairs 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.330
 person imagine that it is like a mirror 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.760
 where you are looking that reflects that 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.800
 your partner of yours that you see in 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.840
 that mirror of you that you do not like 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.720
 what puts you of the hairs that there are of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.570
 absent or denied in you that is 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.910
 a first good starting point for 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.400
 start having a wonderful relationship 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.130
 with yourself I do not tell you that you 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.570
 you have to divorce or separate 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.760
 there are really many people who love each other 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.560
 really but they want very very very in 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.120
 the background and in the form was passed on the day 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.610
 accusing each other of things to each other and 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.480
 complaining and that destroys a relationship 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.190
 So you do not feel like going home 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.989
 neither one clear nor to see the other 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.140
 person because that has become 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.049
 in a battlefield in a war and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.750
 you have to break with all that that you have 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.540
 than throw it away and you have to create a new 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.910
 space in the house and I propose that 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.610
 come out 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.340
 think of finding yourself as if it were for 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.980
 first time I know for example in a park 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.260
 precious in a coffee shop and that 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.540
 you pretend that never before 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.500
 you have seen then when 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.510
 you go approaching that person and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.270
 pose you hear that person calls me the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.000
 attention yes or no and because I would like 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.670
 approaching her and I would like to 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.060
 to conquer what is in it 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.210
 striking that miracle 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.000
 beauty what magic do I see in it and when 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.250
 approaching that person throws you is a 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.920
 I compliment a compress as they say in English 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.460
 that is, I look you in the eyes, I see who 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.490
 you are I love your smile I love the 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.520
 light that I see in your heart start a 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.740
 new beginning start in love with 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.960
 yourselves to be able to fall in love with 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.870
 the other person because when we are 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.510
 able to see the light in another person is 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.200
 because we are seeing it in us 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.270
 you really have to throw away everything 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.410
 it does not work and start falling in love with 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.470
 you play catch and make yourself 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.420
 a fortnight of the reproaches if you are 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.870
 as a couple is the fortnight of the no 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.640
 reproaches and start putting on a paper 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.800
 what is that 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.680
 what I like about the other person 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.590
 because I fell in love with her that 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.590
 I would like him to improve and all that 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.050
 deliver and vice versa the other person and 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.990
 those who do not have a partner is not the end 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.850
 of the world is not drama someone special 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.850
 here inside is waiting and 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.040
 Obviously he waits for you outside so 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.340
 you will have to put on a paper to see 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.700
 how is my ideal partner and on another sheet 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.520
 the exercise would be what I ask 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.710
 I offer because of course the same attracts the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.810
 same so if you want to find a 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.300
 soul mate to someone who speaks to 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.770
 your soul you will have to learn to 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.009
 speak first with yours 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.129
 I wait for you in the next video in this 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.670
 school of emotions that is life in 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.900
 rosette 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.900
 with all my heart 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.030
 ah
