00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
body why is it fiberglass because the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.809 
body why is it fiberglass because the
regular<00:02:30.390> weight<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> GTR<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.590> only<00:02:32.430> has<00:02:32.640> to

regular weight of the GTR I only has to

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.380 
regular weight of the GTR I only has to
do<00:02:32.940> grip<00:02:33.239> not<00:02:33.569> drift<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.760> fiberglass<00:02:36.150> body

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
