00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
like like that idiot you should

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.290 
like like that idiot you should
definitely<00:00:31.520> cycle<00:00:32.520> off<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.820> then<00:00:32.910> fall<00:00:33.120> out

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
definitely cycle off and then fall out

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330 
definitely cycle off and then fall out
in<00:00:33.510> fact<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.530> actually<00:00:34.739> say<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> on

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
in fact some of them actually say it on

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.940 
in fact some of them actually say it on
the<00:00:35.370> bottle<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.290> probably<00:00:37.290> use<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:37.710> eight

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the bottle to probably use right eight

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
the bottle to probably use right eight
weeks<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.059> take<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.360> least<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
weeks or so and to take at least a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.319 
weeks or so and to take at least a
minimum<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> two<00:00:40.800> weeks<00:00:40.829> off<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
minimum of two weeks off so you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
minimum of two weeks off so you
definitely<00:00:42.540> want<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> heed<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.230> counsel

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
definitely want to heed that counsel

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.869 
definitely want to heed that counsel
okay<00:00:44.280> if<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.420> don't<00:00:46.340> first<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.579> you're

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
okay if you don't first of all you're

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
okay if you don't first of all you're
likely<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> develop<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.170> dependency<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.770> them

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
likely to develop a dependency on them

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.380 
likely to develop a dependency on them
which<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.430> probably<00:00:50.640> why<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
which is probably why you don't want to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
which is probably why you don't want to
cycle<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> beginning<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
cycle off of them in the beginning and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
cycle off of them in the beginning and
not<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.480> actually<00:00:54.690> become

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
not only that you're actually become

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.580 
not only that you're actually become
immune<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> effects<00:00:57.109> by<00:00:58.109> basically<00:00:58.500> about

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
immune to the effects by basically about

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.110 
immune to the effects by basically about
frying<00:00:58.920> your<00:00:59.039> central<00:00:59.460> nervous<00:00:59.489> system<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
frying your central nervous system you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.990 
frying your central nervous system you
know<00:01:00.270> essentially<00:01:00.930> no<00:01:01.109> preservative<00:01:01.500> system

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
know essentially no preservative system

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.219 
know essentially no preservative system
responds<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> different<00:01:03.510> types<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.870> stimulus

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
responds to different types of stimulus

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.570 
responds to different types of stimulus
in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> body<00:01:04.589> different<00:01:04.979> hormones<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.460> are

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
in the body different hormones that are

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520 
in the body different hormones that are
released<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.570> body<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> it

released in the in the body and it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
released in the in the body and it
definitely<00:01:07.710> responds<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> ingredients

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
definitely responds to the ingredients

you<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.610> being<00:01:11.790> overly<00:01:12.270> stimulated<00:01:12.570> for

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you know being overly stimulated for

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.300 
you know being overly stimulated for
some<00:01:13.200> time<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> fry<00:01:14.280> your

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
some time it's just going to fry your

for<00:02:05.090> some<00:02:05.270> time<00:02:05.680> me<00:02:06.680> when<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.040> cycle<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.520> them<00:02:07.790> I

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
for some time me when I cycle of them I

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.440 
for some time me when I cycle of them I
like<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.119> do<00:02:08.270> four<00:02:08.959> weeks<00:02:09.200> or<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:09.560> if<00:02:09.890> not<00:02:10.100> more

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
like to do four weeks or so if not more

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.730 
like to do four weeks or so if not more
more<00:02:11.450> recently<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.200> was<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.590> beginning

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
more recently that was in the beginning

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.500 
more recently that was in the beginning
when<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.190> was<00:02:13.490> actually<00:02:13.670> taking<00:02:14.300> them<00:02:14.390> on<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
when I was actually taking them on a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.960 
when I was actually taking them on a
consistent<00:02:14.780> basis<00:02:15.319> more<00:02:16.310> recently<00:02:16.700> I've<00:02:16.850> just

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
consistent basis more recently I've just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.120 
consistent basis more recently I've just
been<00:02:17.090> taking<00:02:17.390> them<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.630> an<00:02:17.780> as-needed<00:02:18.380> basis

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
been taking them on an as-needed basis

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.340 
been taking them on an as-needed basis
so<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> haven't<00:02:19.880> necessarily<00:02:19.970> needed<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.870> cycle

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
so I haven't necessarily needed to cycle

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.160 
so I haven't necessarily needed to cycle
aqua<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.980> might<00:02:22.850> use<00:02:23.060> them<00:02:23.239> once<00:02:23.660> or<00:02:23.870> twice<00:02:24.050> in

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
aqua I might use them once or twice in

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.020 
aqua I might use them once or twice in
there<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.620> all<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.980> week's<00:02:25.190> time<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
there and all in a week's time so to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.180 
there and all in a week's time so to
actually<00:02:26.540> cycle<00:02:27.230> completely<00:02:27.709> off<00:02:27.800> with<00:02:28.040> them

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
actually cycle completely off with them

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.830 
actually cycle completely off with them
don't<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:28.819> necessarily<00:02:29.090> need<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.690> do<00:02:29.810> that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
don't really necessarily need to do that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.199 
don't really necessarily need to do that
because<00:02:30.230> I'm<00:02:30.650> not<00:02:30.830> really<00:02:31.209> consistently

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
because I'm not really consistently

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.290 
because I'm not really consistently
using<00:02:32.480> them<00:02:32.890> but<00:02:33.890> um<00:02:34.190> I'll<00:02:34.850> tell<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.150> I
