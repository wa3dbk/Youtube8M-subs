00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
under another and one looking like

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.660 
under another and one looking like
Michael<00:02:54.650> Jordan<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.950> little<00:02:55.160> bit<00:02:55.280> giving<00:02:55.550> all

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
Michael Jordan a little bit giving all

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.610 
Michael Jordan a little bit giving all
these<00:02:55.790> am<00:02:56.030> ones<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:56.600> didn't<00:02:57.110> have<00:02:57.200> my<00:02:57.320> teammate

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
these am ones I didn't have my teammate

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.990

open<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.070> corner<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.850> know<00:02:58.970> I

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
open in the corner but you know I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.790 
open in the corner but you know I
figured<00:02:59.210> why<00:02:59.570> not<00:02:59.600> just<00:02:59.930> take<00:03:00.110> myself<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.620> might

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
figured why not just take myself I might

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.470 
figured why not just take myself I might
as<00:03:00.920> well<00:03:01.130> so<00:03:01.610> we<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.940> three<00:03:02.180> point<00:03:02.420> lead

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
as well so we have a three point lead

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.210 
as well so we have a three point lead
and<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.260> look<00:03:03.440> at<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.650> defense<00:03:04.070> by<00:03:04.190> the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
and just look at this defense by the
