two<00:00:02.070> four<00:00:02.760> zero<00:00:04.609> here<00:00:05.609> we're<00:00:05.790> looking<00:00:05.910> at<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
two four zero here we're looking at the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.909 
two four zero here we're looking at the
balance<00:00:06.600> between<00:00:06.830> respiration<00:00:07.830> and

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
balance between respiration and

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.110 
balance between respiration and
photosynthesis<00:00:09.740> during<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> day<00:00:14.120> carbon

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
photosynthesis during the day carbon

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.550 
photosynthesis during the day carbon
dioxide<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.139> water<00:00:16.560> are<00:00:17.310> combined<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
dioxide and water are combined in the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.090 
dioxide and water are combined in the
presence<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.279> light<00:00:20.900> to<00:00:21.900> form<00:00:22.140> glucose<00:00:22.740> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
presence of light to form glucose and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.660 
presence of light to form glucose and
oxygen<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.439> only<00:00:25.619> occurs<00:00:26.070> during<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
oxygen so this only occurs during the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.790 
oxygen so this only occurs during the
day<00:00:28.820> equally<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> same<00:00:30.660> time<00:00:32.809> glucose<00:00:33.809> has

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
day equally at the same time glucose has

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.770 
day equally at the same time glucose has
been<00:00:35.070> broken<00:00:35.370> down<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.300> presence<00:00:36.660> of

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
been broken down in the presence of

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.450 
been broken down in the presence of
oxygen<00:00:38.719> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.750> reverse<00:00:40.200> direction<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
oxygen in the reverse direction and that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
oxygen in the reverse direction and that
process<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.210> course<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.840> known<00:00:43.079> as

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
process of course is known as

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.700 
process of course is known as
respiration<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:47.640> occurs<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> time

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.660 

all<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.010> time<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:54.180> fact<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.780> cells<00:00:58.670> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
all the time and in fact in all cells so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270 
all the time and in fact in all cells so
we<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.140> one<00:01:01.140> reaction<00:01:01.469> proceeding<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.160> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
we have one reaction proceeding in this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
we have one reaction proceeding in this
direction<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.960> one<00:01:03.960> reaction<00:01:04.260> proceeding<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
direction and one reaction proceeding in

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
direction and one reaction proceeding in
this<00:01:05.159> direction<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.210> possible<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
this direction and it's possible of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
this direction and it's possible of
course<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.920> they<00:01:08.220> could<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.670> balanced<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
course that they could be balanced so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.870 
course that they could be balanced so
that<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.100> use<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.369> carbon<00:01:15.030> dioxide<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that the use of carbon dioxide and the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.359 
that the use of carbon dioxide and the
consumption<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.869> car<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.409> oxygen<00:01:19.860> may<00:01:20.310> be

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
consumption of car of oxygen may be

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.330 
consumption of car of oxygen may be
balanced<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.869> called<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
balanced this is actually called the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.690 
balanced this is actually called the
compensation<00:01:23.340> point

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.950 

if<00:01:31.700> we<00:01:31.939> increase<00:01:33.670> light<00:01:34.670> intensity<00:01:37.960> during

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
if we increase light intensity during

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.490 
if we increase light intensity during
the<00:01:39.200> day<00:01:39.520> then<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.880> rate<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:42.969> photosynthesis

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
the day then the rate of photosynthesis

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.819 
the day then the rate of photosynthesis
increases<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.600> rate<00:01:50.840> at<00:01:50.869> which<00:01:51.079> we<00:01:51.380> use<00:01:51.619> up

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
increases so the rate at which we use up

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.999 
increases so the rate at which we use up
carbon<00:01:52.340> dioxide<00:01:52.969> will<00:01:53.780> greatly<00:01:54.110> increase<00:01:54.409> and

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
carbon dioxide will greatly increase and

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.359 
carbon dioxide will greatly increase and
the<00:01:56.000> rate<00:01:56.179> of<00:01:56.209> production<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:56.959> oxygen<00:01:57.500> will

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
the rate of production of oxygen will

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.389 
the rate of production of oxygen will
increase<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.110> net<00:02:00.890> effect<00:02:01.929> would<00:02:02.929> be

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
increase so the net effect would be

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:11.860 
increase so the net effect would be
oxygen<00:02:05.200> production<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> we<00:02:10.519> have<00:02:10.670> net<00:02:11.090> oxygen

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
oxygen production so we have net oxygen

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.780 
oxygen production so we have net oxygen
production<00:02:12.620> when<00:02:13.430> there<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.760> high<00:02:16.480> light

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
production when there is high light

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.370 
production when there is high light
intensity

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.850 

if<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.130> compare<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.860> night

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
if we compare that with the night

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.260 
if we compare that with the night
situation<00:02:32.350> respiration<00:02:33.350> continues<00:02:34.270> glucose

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
situation respiration continues glucose

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.990 
situation respiration continues glucose
is<00:02:35.780> broken<00:02:36.110> down<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.770> presence<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.430> oxygen

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
is broken down in the presence of oxygen

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.080 
is broken down in the presence of oxygen
to<00:02:38.180> produce<00:02:38.210> carbon<00:02:38.510> dioxide<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.590> water

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
to produce carbon dioxide and water

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.000 
to produce carbon dioxide and water
releasing<00:02:41.090> energy<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:43.250> plant<00:02:43.520> processes<00:02:44.240> but

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
releasing energy for plant processes but

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.120 
releasing energy for plant processes but
photosynthesis<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.510> not<00:02:47.510> occurring<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.320> so

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
photosynthesis is not occurring and so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.080 
photosynthesis is not occurring and so
there's<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.610> net<00:02:50.770> production<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:52.160> carbon

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
there's a net production of carbon

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.650 
there's a net production of carbon
dioxide<00:02:53.680> however<00:02:54.680> remember<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
dioxide however remember that the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:06.430 
dioxide however remember that the
stomata<00:02:57.020> pars<00:03:01.780> are<00:03:02.780> closed<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:06.290> there

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
stomata pars are closed and so there

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.200 
stomata pars are closed and so there
isn't<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.980> great<00:03:07.280> deal<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.700> carbon<00:03:08.180> dioxide

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
isn't a great deal of carbon dioxide

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.070 
isn't a great deal of carbon dioxide
given<00:03:09.110> off<00:03:09.260> by<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.530> plants
