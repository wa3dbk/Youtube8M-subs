jutting out ugly how do we go ahead and
attach<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.819> handle<00:01:55.270> now<00:01:55.899> as<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.050> put<00:01:56.200> the

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
attach the handle now as you put the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.719 
attach the handle now as you put the
handle<00:01:56.619> through<00:01:56.770> make<00:01:57.130> sure<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.369> line<00:01:57.610> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
handle through make sure you line the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.279 
handle through make sure you line the
hose<00:01:57.909> up<00:01:58.119> doesn't<00:01:58.479> be<00:01:58.539> a<00:01:58.569> little<00:01:58.869> bit<00:01:58.990> tricky

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
hose up doesn't be a little bit tricky

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.020 
hose up doesn't be a little bit tricky
because<00:01:59.470> you've<00:02:00.190> got<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.340> couple<00:02:00.580> of<00:02:00.700> different

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
because you've got a couple of different

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.870 
because you've got a couple of different
pieces<00:02:01.210> pushing<00:02:01.750> against<00:02:02.020> each<00:02:02.110> other<00:02:02.880> after

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
pieces pushing against each other after

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.219 
pieces pushing against each other after
you<00:02:03.909> get<00:02:04.060> those<00:02:04.210> holes<00:02:04.420> lined<00:02:04.600> up<00:02:04.810> don't<00:02:05.110> put

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
you get those holes lined up don't put

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.389 
you get those holes lined up don't put
the<00:02:05.319> screws<00:02:05.590> through<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.830> same<00:02:06.069> as<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
the screws through the same as on the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.630 
the screws through the same as on the
other<00:02:06.429> pieces<00:02:07.950> after<00:02:08.950> you've<00:02:09.069> got<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> handle

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
other pieces after you've got the handle

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.070 
other pieces after you've got the handle
or<00:02:09.729> something<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.239> next<00:02:10.269> step<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.840> put<00:02:10.929> it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
or something the next step is to put it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.780 
or something the next step is to put it
down<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.260> more<00:02:11.380> now<00:02:12.220> you'll<00:02:12.400> see<00:02:12.549> there's

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
down the more now you'll see there's

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.240 
down the more now you'll see there's
these<00:02:12.940> two<00:02:13.000> little<00:02:13.209> studs<00:02:14.040> located<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
these two little studs located on the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.630 
these two little studs located on the
main<00:02:15.400> wheel<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:17.500> exactly<00:02:17.890> match<00:02:18.160> these

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
main wheel they exactly match these

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.310 
main wheel they exactly match these
holes<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:21.310> ahead<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:24.870> press<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.110> handle

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
holes just go ahead and press the handle

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.789 
holes just go ahead and press the handle
in<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.560> little<00:02:26.769> bit<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> other

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
in a little bit and on the other

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.110 
in a little bit and on the other
after<00:02:29.799> you've<00:02:29.920> got<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.459> handles<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
after you've got the handles on the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.550 
after you've got the handles on the
blade<00:02:31.269> go<00:02:31.870> ahead<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.109> take<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.380> air

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
blade go ahead and take this air

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.069 
blade go ahead and take this air
detaining<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.450> let<00:02:34.450> me<00:02:34.480> go<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.780> Ridge

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
detaining that let me go to that Ridge

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.110 
detaining that let me go to that Ridge
you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:36.370> go<00:02:36.430> ahead<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.700> press<00:02:36.880> with<00:02:37.060> your

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
you can go ahead and press with your

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.880 
you can go ahead and press with your
finger<00:02:37.480> that's<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.959> little<00:02:38.200> bit<00:02:38.380> tough<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.590> do

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
finger that's a little bit tough to do

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.650 
finger that's a little bit tough to do
so<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.579> recommend<00:02:39.880> instead<00:02:40.269> taking<00:02:40.600> a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
so I recommend instead taking a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.599 
so I recommend instead taking a
screwdriver<00:02:41.100> holding<00:02:42.100> your<00:02:42.190> fingers<00:02:42.459> on

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
screwdriver holding your fingers on

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.940 
screwdriver holding your fingers on
either<00:02:42.790> side<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.359> retaining<00:02:43.630> nut<00:02:43.950> and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
either side of the retaining nut and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.069 
either side of the retaining nut and
pressing<00:02:45.370> down<00:02:45.489> with<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.730> screwdriver<00:02:46.209> until

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
pressing down with the screwdriver until

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.090 
pressing down with the screwdriver until
you<00:02:47.260> feel<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.470> click<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:49.799> they'll<00:02:50.799> be<00:02:50.920> held

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
you feel it click and they'll be held

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.530 
you feel it click and they'll be held
securely<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.609> place

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
securely in place

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.539 
securely in place
now<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.170> see<00:02:54.439> how<00:02:54.590> easy<00:02:54.799> it<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.280> get<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
now you see how easy it is to get the

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.520 
now you see how easy it is to get the
handle<00:02:55.939> together<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.569> make<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.870> adjustments

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
handle together to make the adjustments

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.530 
handle together to make the adjustments
and<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:58.430> put<00:02:58.549> everything<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.120> fun<00:02:59.390> or
