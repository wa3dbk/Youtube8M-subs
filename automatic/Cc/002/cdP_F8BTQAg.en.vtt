actually<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.310> very<00:01:14.880> clearly<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.630> we're

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
actually see very clearly when we're

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
actually see very clearly when we're
passing<00:01:16.229> midnight<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.790> do

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
passing midnight and that's what you do

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.370 
passing midnight and that's what you do
you<00:01:18.240> take<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.840> watch<00:01:19.049> past<00:01:19.530> midnight<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you take the watch past midnight and the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.760 
you take the watch past midnight and the
date<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.770> change<00:01:23.479> now<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.110> point<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
date will change now at this point you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.890 
date will change now at this point you
toggle<00:01:26.460> back<00:01:26.700> counterclockwise<00:01:28.009> four<00:01:29.009> ways

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
toggle back counterclockwise four ways

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
toggle back counterclockwise four ways
usually<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.439> don't<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
usually you don't have to go back that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.319 
usually you don't have to go back that
far<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.689> depends<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> unit<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
far it just depends on the unit and you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.700 
far it just depends on the unit and you
heard<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:36.930> click<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> saw<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
heard that little click and you saw the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490 
heard that little click and you saw the
date<00:01:38.040> moving<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> window<00:01:38.990> then<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
date moving the window then you take it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.420 
date moving the window then you take it
back<00:01:40.710> past<00:01:41.220> midnight<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:43.740> date<00:01:44.009> will

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
back past midnight and the date will

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.200 
back past midnight and the date will
change<00:01:44.820> again<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.829> follow<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.549> pattern<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
change again you follow this pattern of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.270 
change again you follow this pattern of
toggling<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.350> forth<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.420> how

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
toggling back and forth and that is how

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.330 
toggling back and forth and that is how
you<00:01:53.280> change<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.820> date<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.680> most<00:01:55.680> Russian

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you change the date on most Russian

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.889 
you change the date on most Russian
watches<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:59.240> you<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.780> go

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
watches this way you don't have to go

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.410 
watches this way you don't have to go
all<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.259> around<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.829> horn<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.420> change

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
all the way around the horn and change

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
date watch this the date will jog a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.819 
date watch this the date will jog a
little<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.110> window<00:03:16.170> you'll<00:03:17.170> hear<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> click

changing the date on these watches you

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.099 
changing the date on these watches you
will<00:03:47.109> not<00:03:47.380> damage<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.069> movement<00:03:48.519> if<00:03:49.299> you<00:03:49.630> keep

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
will not damage the movement if you keep

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.309 
will not damage the movement if you keep
your<00:03:50.470> counter<00:03:50.919> clockwise<00:03:51.220> activity<00:03:52.319> tightly

within this motion of toggling the watch
back<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.030> forth<00:03:58.299> I've<00:03:59.139> change<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.500> one<00:03:59.620> more

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
back and forth I've change it one more
