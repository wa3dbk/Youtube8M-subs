00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.379
 good today we will learn how it is that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.330
 We 're going to cook and we're going to go. 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.580
 prepare the beans so that they flee from 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 day to day then base beans that later 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.219
 Are you going to temper according to what? 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.230
 you want 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.449
 First we'll start cooking. 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 beans then I'll put the beans already 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.920
 chosen and previously washed in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.960
 of the pressure cooker that the most 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.220
 quick to prepare the beans but has 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.820
 some other ways that we will 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.680
 to discover 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.030
 in a little while the first beans 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.160
 straight into the pressure cooker 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.440
 now I'll cover it with more or 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.980
 three to four fingers above the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.899
 that he is full of water with the water already 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
 do not always be careful when it comes to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.410
 close your pressure cooker because it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 There is this shorty, it 's good, we try. 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.870
 always facing the right side but not 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 closed in the mouth of the stove that I go 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.870
 leave her here at least 45 and 50 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.059
 minutes 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.180
 those 40 and 50 minutes they start to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.040
 From the moment that the the valve starts 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.159
 It's good to sizzle. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 the 40 and 45 minutes passed and the beans 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.540
 You're ready to open it every time. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.840
 careful then you have to have finished 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.150
 get out the air here never put the pan 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.770
 under the water because otherwise you will 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.150
 importing and damaging the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 pan let her lose the temperature 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.540
 naturally and we already have a bean 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.579
 cooked 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.650
 so he's here already in his time 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.390
 Cooking sure we can see 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.079
 since the grains are beginning to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.610
 Open 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.710
 This is because we did not leave 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.780
 soya bean sauce if you want to do with 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.060
 that it does not happen that leaves the beans 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 of the evening sauce for him too 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
 reduces cooking time by more or 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.070
 less than 15 minutes or between 40 and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.829
 50 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.899
 You'll cook it 30 to 35 minutes. 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.970
 people have the caldinho already the beans that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.920
 It's really cool, and now we're going. 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.930
 prepare him to conserve then I will 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.299
 take the beans out of here and I can not 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.299
 temper it because from the moment 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.240
 the seasoning to this chance to be sour 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.460
 it's too big 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.100
 I have two ways to conserve 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.690
 first in the refrigerator then shot 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.640
 it from the container where it was produced 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.150
 I can not put it in the fridge 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.960
 and the second form is frozen to 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.210
 Freeze 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.090
 I suggest you at home not to 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.120
 fill the freezer with a pot of 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.860
 ice cream full of beans for that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.660
 make smaller and almost 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.330
 individual bean we can 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.730
 put them inside cups of 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.100
 plastic they are cheap easy to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.160
 find and when you will serve or 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.650
 use you only rip the cup and he 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.270
 is ready for you to use a 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.320
 cup gives a portion or more of 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.480
 two people 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.600
 so if you do it for 468 people 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.980
 to take the number of cups to the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.390
 people you are going to do 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.630
 Be careful when you put it here. 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.230
 inside to not burn in champagne 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.940
 the cup put some of the cup 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.040
 to be able to cover well and that's how it is 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.260
 How is he here that I'm going to save? 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.420
 he in my freezer 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.630
 it can be stored in the freezer for 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.850
 up to six months without any problems and 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.130
 time to thaw in the pan and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.190
 seasoning as we will see the next 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.190
 video and that's how we cook 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.190
 bean
