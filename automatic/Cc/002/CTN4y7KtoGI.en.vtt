00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.290
 hello to everyone and how are you already 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.750
 guess what it is 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.560
 a sawmill but not quite a sawmill since 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 you still have to cut down trees but 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.980
 can be made fully automatic 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.080
 if you put the paint in here and that's it 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.480
 make a brick such a gas can 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.550
 like breaking a brick it won't break 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.620
 pure tree if i put here 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.460
 for example, and stand Russia upgrade it 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.290
 will shoot you fall into the tree and 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.710
 the tree will get under way on doing this 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.740
 I did not and whose curved Artful 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.050
 so I will immediately say that this is Liz Spilka 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.270
 works only on birch sapling and 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.970
 harder teeth that is, you can only plant 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.370
 oak or birch 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.910
 in theory here is not so simple but 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.750
 of course the mechanism was not compact 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.640
 that is, it turned out still big 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.070
 but this is due to raising it. 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.290
 timings start timing too need something 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.820
 there is a channel here we work i so 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.730
 Now I will quickly explain when she 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.720
 Here it works, that is, from here, the current 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 walks over here and he goes down there when 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.489
 it works that is this block he 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.950
 gets out of here that is how we see 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:42.200
 it's like earth she moves in here 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.650
 the piston that is back and starts to survive 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.780
 sand that is push the tree up 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.640
 chatting and it all goes this way 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.489
 here someone walks here he just 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.290
 starts to stack like this 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.290
 can do and how much 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.320
 this is the first version of the mechanism will be soon 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.680
 the second one is just going to say very much in advance 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.210
 Soon there will be a second one here when here 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.340
 it all work starts its 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.490
 movement that is timing is needed here 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.960
 stand by this memory cell with a timer pro 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.700
 who was telling recently 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.650
 coming up later in a certain 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.390
 place in stand it begins it is the opposite 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.910
 that is, moves back to this 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.010
 table that is here so to speak 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.970
 movement that is here we see these 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.190
 pistons that we have as uncomfortable then 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.060
 all that is not what they are when he comes here 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:40.100
 pushes on top then back 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:43.410
 you all everything else it's timing 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.050
 watch systems that like a slave turning on 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.580
 baptisms and so on all is completely 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.260
 I will not tell the card will be 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.040
 description 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.620
 Downloading to watch 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.830
 test write your mistakes that you 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.840
 found flaws and so on here perhaps 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.180
 still repeat that ska 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 running the second version for more so 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.160
 say functional that's all to all 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.170
 as long as you have been waiting for new videos and 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.640
 sky for and be sure to put likes 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.640
