it's right next to the road and there's
plenty<00:03:16.829> of<00:03:16.920> power<00:03:17.100> lines<00:03:17.400> around<00:03:17.870> okay<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.410> you

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
plenty of power lines around okay as you

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.350 
plenty of power lines around okay as you
hear

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
hear

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.580 
hear
and<00:03:23.490> crank<00:03:24.490> up<00:03:24.580> by<00:03:24.730> sensitivity<00:03:28.590> that's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and crank up by sensitivity that's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.730 
and crank up by sensitivity that's
without<00:03:30.160> doing<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> frequency<00:03:30.910> scan<00:03:31.740> several

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
without doing the frequency scan several

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.930 
without doing the frequency scan several
guys<00:03:32.860> throw<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.130> lot<00:03:33.310> I'll<00:03:33.940> be<00:03:34.030> back<00:03:34.210> in<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.390> sec

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
guys throw a lot I'll be back in a sec

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.010 
guys throw a lot I'll be back in a sec
I'll<00:03:36.940> just<00:03:37.090> quickly<00:03:37.390> go<00:03:37.660> through<00:03:37.690> the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
I'll just quickly go through the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.940 
I'll just quickly go through the
settings<00:03:38.380> cause<00:03:38.760> already<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.840> sensitivity

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
settings cause already a sensitivity

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.990 
settings cause already a sensitivity
it's<00:03:41.950> cranked<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:42.780> Rony<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:44.520> yeah<00:03:45.520> threshold

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
it's cranked up Rony a yeah threshold

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.100 
it's cranked up Rony a yeah threshold
we're<00:03:46.900> gonna<00:03:47.050> on<00:03:47.200> nine<00:03:48.060> okay<00:03:50.130> yeah<00:03:51.160> Oh<00:03:52.110> gram

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
we're gonna on nine okay yeah Oh gram

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.900 
we're gonna on nine okay yeah Oh gram
balance<00:03:54.930> we'll<00:03:55.930> put<00:03:56.110> it<00:03:56.170> up<00:03:56.230> about<00:03:56.910> second

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
balance we'll put it up about second

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
balance we'll put it up about second
from<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.060> top<00:03:58.180> today<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:59.489> got<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.520> bit<00:04:00.670> of

from the top today just got a bit of
mineralization<00:04:01.930> here<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:04.630> our<00:04:05.140> volume<00:04:06.450> just

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
mineralization here and our volume just

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.890 
mineralization here and our volume just
cranked<00:04:07.810> up<00:04:08.760> that's<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.970> guys<00:04:10.180> it's<00:04:10.450> implies

the interference from the houses the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.000 
the interference from the houses the
power<00:04:31.390> lines<00:04:31.660> in<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.560> would<00:04:32.830> be<00:04:33.040> shopping<00:04:35.010> I'm

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
power lines in it would be shopping I'm

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.860 
power lines in it would be shopping I'm
sure<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.790> some<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.419> guys<00:04:37.540> out<00:04:37.810> there

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
sure that some of the guys out there

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.600 
sure that some of the guys out there
that<00:04:38.080> use<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.410> fire<00:04:38.680> thousands<00:04:39.160> would<00:04:39.370> be<00:04:39.520> able

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
that use of fire thousands would be able

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.219 
that use of fire thousands would be able
to<00:04:39.700> minimize<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:40.690> wouldn't<00:04:40.930> be<00:04:41.050> able<00:04:41.140> to

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
to minimize that but wouldn't be able to

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.460 
to minimize that but wouldn't be able to
get<00:04:41.380> rid<00:04:41.500> of<00:04:41.620> all<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:42.010> so<00:04:43.260> that's<00:04:44.260> just

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
get rid of all that so that's just

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.800 
get rid of all that so that's just
showing<00:04:44.710> how<00:04:44.919> good<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.280> ATX<00:04:45.669> handles<00:04:46.510> the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
showing how good the ATX handles the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.560 
showing how good the ATX handles the
the<00:04:48.710> interference<00:04:49.220> ready<00:04:49.510> okay<00:04:50.510> off<00:04:50.810> we<00:04:50.990> go

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
the interference ready okay off we go

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.560 
the interference ready okay off we go
okay<00:04:53.570> it's<00:04:53.720> just<00:04:53.780> good<00:04:54.080> our<00:04:55.420> target<00:04:56.420> out<00:04:56.540> of

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
okay it's just good our target out of

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
okay it's just good our target out of
the<00:04:56.690> grand<00:04:56.900> knee<00:04:59.110> nothing<00:05:00.110> a<00:05:00.170> little<00:05:00.260> bit<00:05:00.500> of
