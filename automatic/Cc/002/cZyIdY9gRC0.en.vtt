around the wrist for articulation the
head<00:02:53.769> rotates<00:02:54.760> 360<00:02:55.330> degrees<00:02:56.459> unfortunately

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
head rotates 360 degrees unfortunately

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.640 
head rotates 360 degrees unfortunately
doesn't<00:02:57.610> go<00:02:57.730> up<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.000> down<00:02:58.120> arms<00:02:58.630> rotate<00:02:58.780> 360

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
doesn't go up and down arms rotate 360

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.650 
doesn't go up and down arms rotate 360
degrees<00:02:59.709> go<00:03:00.549> out<00:03:00.670> from<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:00.910> body<00:03:01.060> back<00:03:01.420> in

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
degrees go out from the body back in

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.420 
degrees go out from the body back in
they've<00:03:02.200> been<00:03:02.319> forward<00:03:02.739> at<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.980> elbow<00:03:03.250> and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
they've been forward at the elbow and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.380 
they've been forward at the elbow and
back<00:03:04.390> at<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.660> elbow<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.500> rotate<00:03:06.330> 360<00:03:07.330> degrees

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
back at the elbow and rotate 360 degrees

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.890 
back at the elbow and rotate 360 degrees
then<00:03:08.430> now<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.700> does<00:03:09.880> not<00:03:10.060> rotate<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.720> waist

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
then now it does not rotate the waist

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.729 
then now it does not rotate the waist
but<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.200> does<00:03:11.380> rotate<00:03:11.620> up<00:03:12.069> here<00:03:12.489> at<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.739> upper

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
but it does rotate up here at the upper

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.460 
but it does rotate up here at the upper
chest<00:03:15.280> area<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:16.420> can<00:03:16.569> go<00:03:16.780> forward<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.290> back

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
chest area it can go forward and back

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.340 
chest area it can go forward and back
there<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.790> said<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.150> rotate<00:03:19.480> 360

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
there and like I said to rotate 360

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.449 
there and like I said to rotate 360
degrees<00:03:20.410> let's<00:03:21.280> go<00:03:21.430> forward<00:03:22.320> back<00:03:23.340> bend<00:03:24.340> at

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
degrees let's go forward back bend at

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.910 
degrees let's go forward back bend at
the<00:03:24.489> knee<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:26.829> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
the knee and that's it so the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.460 
the knee and that's it so the
articulation<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.640> pretty<00:03:27.940> limited<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:29.260> it's

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
articulation is pretty limited but it's

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.110 
articulation is pretty limited but it's
still<00:03:29.709> really<00:03:29.890> nice<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.370> still<00:03:30.609> can<00:03:30.940> get

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
still really nice and you still can get

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.330

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
him into pretty cool poses now he comes

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.030

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
there it goes now for the phaser side

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.820 
there it goes now for the phaser side
same<00:06:00.700> thing<00:06:00.730> let's<00:06:01.690> put<00:06:01.870> it<00:06:01.960> in<00:06:02.080> now<00:06:02.770> the
