00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
with a little tutorial on how to make

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.750 
with a little tutorial on how to make
your<00:00:14.820> gun<00:00:15.480> disappear<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.260> black<00:00:16.500> ops<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.010> then

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
your gun disappear on black ops and then

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.210 
your gun disappear on black ops and then
how<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.029> incorporate<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.930> into<00:00:19.080> trickshot<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
how to incorporate it into trickshot so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.189 
how to incorporate it into trickshot so
we're<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.670> start<00:00:20.850> off<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.199> l96a1

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
we're going to start off with the l96a1

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.890 
we're going to start off with the l96a1
and<00:00:22.710> all<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.070> need<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.789> pull<00:00:24.750> out<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and all you need to do is pull out a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529 
and all you need to do is pull out a
semtex<00:00:25.590> about<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.820> or<00:00:27.029> two<00:00:27.060> milliseconds

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
semtex about one or two milliseconds

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.750 
semtex about one or two milliseconds
after<00:00:28.140> you've<00:00:28.439> taken<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.800> shot<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.580> see

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
after you've taken a shot so as you see

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.120 
after you've taken a shot so as you see
here<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.050> aiming<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> height<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
here you can do it aiming the height and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.900 
here you can do it aiming the height and
as<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.030> no<00:00:33.780> gun<00:00:34.050> whatsoever<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.520> again<00:00:35.790> if

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
as you see no gun whatsoever so again if

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.069 
as you see no gun whatsoever so again if
you<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> when

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you see there you can do this when

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.319 
you see there you can do this when
you're<00:00:37.290> no<00:00:37.530> scoping<00:00:38.040> quickscoping<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.120> even

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you're no scoping quickscoping or even

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.110 
you're no scoping quickscoping or even
hardscoping<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.140> you'll<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.309> no<00:00:41.700> guns<00:00:41.969> no

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
hardscoping and you'll have no guns no

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.209 
hardscoping and you'll have no guns no
hands<00:00:42.629> nothing<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.410> screen<00:00:43.649> except<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
hands nothing on your screen except the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
hands nothing on your screen except the
head-up<00:00:44.460> display<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.530> easy

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
head-up display so this is really easy

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.290 
head-up display so this is really easy
to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> there's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.850> lot<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.030> cool<00:00:48.270> stuff

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to do and there's a lot of cool stuff

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
to do and there's a lot of cool stuff
you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.379> we'll<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you can do with it but we'll get on to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.040 
you can do with it but we'll get on to
that<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.610> bit<00:00:50.940> later<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.390> towards<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that a little bit later on towards the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
that a little bit later on towards the
end<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.350> video<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.250> I'm<00:00:53.789> just

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
end of this video so here I'm just

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
end of this video so here I'm just
demonstrating<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.440> done

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
demonstrating that it can also be done

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.880 
demonstrating that it can also be done
with<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.239> psg1<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> any<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.199> sniper<00:00:58.530> on

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
with the psg1 and any other sniper on

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.920 
with the psg1 and any other sniper on
the<00:00:58.920> game<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.969> doesn't<00:01:00.090> matter<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.629> site

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the game so it doesn't matter what site

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.779 
the game so it doesn't matter what site
you've<00:01:01.079> gotten<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> sniper<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:02.070> what<00:01:02.280> sniper<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you've gotten a sniper or what sniper it

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.000 
you've gotten a sniper or what sniper it
is<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> possible<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is it is possible to do this with and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
is it is possible to do this with and
you're<00:01:05.850> gone<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> find<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you're gone for like to find that you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
you're gone for like to find that you
can<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.320> absolutely<00:01:07.890> any<00:01:08.310> gun<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
can do it with absolutely any gun on the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
can do it with absolutely any gun on the
game<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:10.049> I've<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:10.830> found<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> best

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
game but I've really found that the best

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
game but I've really found that the best
use<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.240> doing<00:01:12.390> call<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.900> sniper

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
use for it is just doing call a sniper

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
use for it is just doing call a sniper
trickshot<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:14.909> just

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
trickshot I'm here I'm just

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
trickshot I'm here I'm just
demonstrating<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.170> done<00:01:16.320> with

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
demonstrating that it can be done with

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.940 
demonstrating that it can be done with
all<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> pistols<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> ASP<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.950> now

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
all the pistols this is the ASP and now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
all the pistols this is the ASP and now
after<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> show<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
after this I'm gonna go on to show you a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.929 
after this I'm gonna go on to show you a
few<00:01:22.200> cool<00:01:22.590> trick<00:01:22.830> shots<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.700> hit

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
few cool trick shots that you can hit

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.810 
few cool trick shots that you can hit
while<00:01:24.659> incorporating<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.890> salad<00:01:26.310> shots<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
while incorporating the salad shots so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.630 
while incorporating the salad shots so
that's<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> basic<00:01:28.470> no<00:01:28.619> scope<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that's like a basic no scope and it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.800 
that's like a basic no scope and it
looks<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:29.880> cool<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.450> have

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
looks pretty cool because you have

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.090 
looks pretty cool because you have
nothing<00:01:31.049> left<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> screen<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.979> your

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
nothing left on the screen and your

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
nothing left on the screen and your
hands<00:01:32.280> move<00:01:32.549> away<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.780> fade<00:01:34.110> shot

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
hands move away that's a fade shot

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
hands move away that's a fade shot
incorporating<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> hit

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
incorporating it but I get the hit

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.109 
incorporating it but I get the hit
marker<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.420> was<00:01:36.630> annoying<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119

marker which was annoying this is just
again<00:01:39.479> another<00:01:39.930> trick<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.009> by

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
again another trick you can do just by

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
again another trick you can do just by
tapping<00:01:41.340> y<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:41.970> ending<00:01:42.869> by<00:01:43.079> pulling<00:01:43.799> out

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
tapping y and then ending by pulling out

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 
tapping y and then ending by pulling out
your<00:01:43.920> semtex<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.579> after<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.939> shoot<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.929 
your semtex just after you shoot this is
the<00:01:46.439> same<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.860> me<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.280> faking<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the same with me just faking out the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.780 
the same with me just faking out the
trick<00:01:48.600> shot<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.640> I'm

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
trick shot and then on this one I'm

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.760 
trick shot and then on this one I'm
using<00:01:51.060> scavenger<00:01:51.689> pro<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.200> fall<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> my

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
using scavenger pro so I do fall to my

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.929 
using scavenger pro so I do fall to my
death<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.130> i'm<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.340> sure<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.670> looks

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
death and i'm not sure if that looks

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.670 
death and i'm not sure if that looks
better<00:01:54.180> or<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.689> i<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:55.140> lightweight

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
better or not but i think lightweight

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.649 
better or not but i think lightweight
pro<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> better<00:01:56.340> idea<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.420> one

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
pro would be a better idea on this one

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
pro would be a better idea on this one
i'm<00:01:57.960> actually<00:01:58.290> getting<00:01:58.530> rid<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.100> my<00:01:59.310> gun

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
i'm actually getting rid of my gun

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
i'm actually getting rid of my gun
before<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.270> trick<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.020> kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.740> missed<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
before the trick and kind of missed the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.440 
before the trick and kind of missed the
first<00:02:02.250> shot<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:02.790> picked<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.270> on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
first shot there which picked it up on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.889 
first shot there which picked it up on
the<00:02:03.540> second<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.229> same<00:02:05.219> idea<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> these
