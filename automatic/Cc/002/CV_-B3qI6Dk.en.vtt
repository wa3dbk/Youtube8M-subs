screw on they just they're threaded I'm
guessing<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:37.910> pretty<00:02:38.910> old<00:02:39.060> I'm<00:02:39.270> saying

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
guessing this is pretty old I'm saying

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.530 
guessing this is pretty old I'm saying
I'm<00:02:40.470> guessing<00:02:40.800> from<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> 50s<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.940> predates<00:02:42.300> me

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
I'm guessing from the 50s it predates me

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.680 
I'm guessing from the 50s it predates me
anyhow<00:02:42.900> put<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.560> way<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.569> pretty

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
anyhow put that way so it's in pretty

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.230 
anyhow put that way so it's in pretty
good<00:02:45.780> shape<00:02:45.930> there's<00:02:46.319> no<00:02:46.410> major<00:02:46.620> dings<00:02:46.970> or<00:02:47.970> NOx

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
good shape there's no major dings or NOx

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.100 
good shape there's no major dings or NOx
dents<00:02:49.610> handing<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.760> sort<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.840> carried

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
dents handing of the sort can be carried

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.590 
dents handing of the sort can be carried
around<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.850> have<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> feeling<00:02:54.210> now<00:02:54.300> suppose<00:02:54.540> to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
around I have a feeling now suppose to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.850 
around I have a feeling now suppose to
be<00:02:54.660> honest<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.050> does<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.410> hook<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.710> it

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
be honest and does it have a hook on it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.180 
be honest and does it have a hook on it
and<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.330> last<00:02:57.510> piece<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.720> equipment<00:02:58.170> here<00:02:58.440> is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
and the last piece of equipment here is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.720 
and the last piece of equipment here is
uh<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.750> believe<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.470> timing<00:03:01.709> strobe<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
uh I believe this is a timing strobe you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.300 
uh I believe this is a timing strobe you
can<00:03:02.880> look<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.300> it's<00:03:03.569> got<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> big<00:03:03.900> light

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
can look in there it's got a big light

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.740 
can look in there it's got a big light
it<00:03:05.310> has<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:06.200> knob<00:03:07.200> here<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:08.550> probably<00:03:09.000> adjusts

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
it has a knob here that probably adjusts

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.880 
it has a knob here that probably adjusts
the<00:03:09.840> strobe<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.890> has<00:03:11.040> two<00:03:11.310> leads

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
the strobe it has two leads

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.880 
the strobe it has two leads
positive<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.880> negative<00:03:14.210> and<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.530> on<00:03:15.770> the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
positive and negative and then on the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.110 
positive and negative and then on the
backside<00:03:16.100> here<00:03:17.500> it's<00:03:18.500> got<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.770> battery<00:03:19.670> cable

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
backside here it's got a battery cable

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.430 
backside here it's got a battery cable
connections<00:03:20.540> probably<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.050> hook<00:03:21.140> up<00:03:21.290> your

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
connections probably to hook up your

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.610 
connections probably to hook up your
your<00:03:22.100> battery<00:03:22.400> cables<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:24.290> probably

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
your battery cables so this probably

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.230 
your battery cables so this probably
goes<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> bigger<00:03:25.490> piece<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.730> equipment

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
goes to a bigger piece of equipment

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.450 
goes to a bigger piece of equipment
probably<00:03:26.570> some<00:03:26.720> engine<00:03:26.990> analyzer<00:03:27.340> from<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
probably some engine analyzer from the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.430 
probably some engine analyzer from the
day<00:03:29.530> or<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:31.010> could<00:03:31.190> use<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.460> to<00:03:31.900> be<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> Martian

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440
