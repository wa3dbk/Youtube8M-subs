Gameboy<00:00:06.629> advanced<00:00:07.049> but<00:00:07.790> in<00:00:08.790> most<00:00:09.000> Mario<00:00:09.240> games

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
Gameboy advanced but in most Mario games

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.730 
Gameboy advanced but in most Mario games
there's<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.990> character<00:00:10.200> boo

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
there's the character boo

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.999 
there's the character boo
he's<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.429> really<00:00:11.670> iconic<00:00:11.790> ghost<00:00:12.509> and

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
he's just the really iconic ghost and

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.350 
he's just the really iconic ghost and
usually<00:00:14.009> his<00:00:14.160> game<00:00:14.340> mechanic<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> when<00:00:15.240> you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
usually his game mechanic is when you

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.849 
usually his game mechanic is when you
look<00:00:15.540> at<00:00:15.660> him<00:00:15.809> he<00:00:15.929> does<00:00:16.109> nothing<00:00:16.619> he's<00:00:16.770> just

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859

look at him he does nothing he's just
sort<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.190> there<00:00:17.430> he's<00:00:17.699> just<00:00:17.960> stand<00:00:18.960> still<00:00:19.199> but

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
sort of there he's just stand still but

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.550 
sort of there he's just stand still but
as<00:00:19.920> soon<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> player<00:00:20.460> looks<00:00:20.789> away<00:00:21.560> he

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
as soon as the player looks away he

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.230 
as soon as the player looks away he
turns<00:00:22.800> into<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> ghost<00:00:23.250> again<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.789> starts

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
turns into a ghost again and starts

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.660 
turns into a ghost again and starts
chasing<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.869> that's<00:00:25.680> kind<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.369> what<00:00:26.550> I've

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
chasing you and that's kind of what I've

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.150 
chasing you and that's kind of what I've
tried<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> recreate<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.170> then<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.039> can

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
tried to recreate here and then you can

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.179 
tried to recreate here and then you can
see<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.640> turn<00:00:30.119> around<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.890> mole<00:00:32.040> gets

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
see all turn around and the mole gets

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
see all turn around and the mole gets
placed<00:00:32.399> back<00:00:32.610> down<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.390> saw<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> kind<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.930> used

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
placed back down you saw I kind of used

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620 
placed back down you saw I kind of used
some<00:00:34.290> mechanics<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.190> he<00:00:35.579> died<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
some mechanics here he died and then the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.130 
some mechanics here he died and then the
mole<00:00:36.780> got<00:00:36.899> spawned<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:38.480> yeah<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.690> that's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
mole got spawned in yeah so that's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
mole got spawned in yeah so that's
that's<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.559> much<00:00:40.800> how<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> works<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that's pretty much how it works so you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.479 
that's pretty much how it works so you
can<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> turned<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.100> he<00:00:44.190> turns

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
can see I turned around and he turns

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.930 
can see I turned around and he turns
back<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> guest<00:00:45.719> again<00:00:46.789> turned<00:00:47.789> back

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
back into the guest again turned back

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
back into the guest again turned back

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
exactly this thing's working so I have

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
exactly this thing's working so I have
two<00:01:21.119> sets<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.200> command<00:01:22.590> blocks<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.400> one

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
two sets of command blocks here this one

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.770 
two sets of command blocks here this one
oh<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.790> there<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.450> turns<00:01:27.689> him

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
oh that there we go this one turns him

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.800 
oh that there we go this one turns him
into<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> ghost<00:01:28.259> oh<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.240> can't<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> if

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
into the ghost oh I can't do this if

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
into the ghost oh I can't do this if
he's<00:01:30.930> near<00:01:31.140> all<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:31.590> redstone<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
he's near all my redstone and then this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.960 
he's near all my redstone and then this
one<00:01:33.020> turns<00:01:34.020> him<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.619> wool<00:01:34.770> block<00:01:35.009> so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
one turns him into the wool block so

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.880 
one turns him into the wool block so
what's<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.869> there's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> wither

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
skull in there and basically what this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
skull in there and basically what this
set<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.189> command<00:01:41.520> blocks<00:01:41.729> does<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.549> deletes

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
set of command blocks does is it deletes

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.399 
set of command blocks does is it deletes
all<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.479> blocks<00:01:45.720> around<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.290> wither<00:01:46.439> skull

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
all the blocks around the wither skull

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.569 
all the blocks around the wither skull
someone's<00:01:49.409> aghast<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> wither<00:01:50.130> skull<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
someone's aghast at the wither skull and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.359 
someone's aghast at the wither skull and
then<00:01:50.670> kills<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.119> wither<00:01:51.299> skull<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.189> boom<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
then kills the wither skull so boom and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.050 
then kills the wither skull so boom and
then<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.119> does<00:01:54.299> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.930> opposite

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
then this one does kind of the opposite

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.800 
then this one does kind of the opposite
someone's<00:01:57.060> over<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.270> school<00:01:57.570> where<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
someone's over there school where the

and then it will summon wool around

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.300 
and then it will summon wool around
where<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> wither<00:02:03.600> skull<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> see

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
where the wither skull is so you can see

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310 
where the wither skull is so you can see
I<00:02:05.340> hit<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.110> then

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
I hit this and then

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.290 
I hit this and then
and<00:02:07.620> then<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.830> also<00:02:07.920> kills<00:02:08.460> any<00:02:08.640> items<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.210> any

and then it also kills any items for any

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.800 
and then it also kills any items for any
to<00:02:09.630> take<00:02:09.780> care<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.990> any<00:02:10.140> gas<00:02:10.320> drops<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.810> then

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to take care of any gas drops and then

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.510 
to take care of any gas drops and then
lastly<00:02:13.200> over<00:02:13.470> here<00:02:15.020> there's<00:02:16.020> four<00:02:16.620> eight

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
lastly over here there's four eight

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.100 
lastly over here there's four eight
eight<00:02:17.760> command<00:02:18.209> locks<00:02:18.360> here<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:18.690> each<00:02:18.870> set

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
eight command locks here well each set

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.900 
eight command locks here well each set
of<00:02:19.140> four<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:22.290> set<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.650> detects<00:02:23.100> when<00:02:23.459> I'm

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
of four this set here detects when I'm

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.230 
of four this set here detects when I'm
faced<00:02:24.630> when<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.620> facing<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.250> gas<00:02:26.700> no<00:02:27.090> this

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
faced when I'm facing the gas no this

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.930 
faced when I'm facing the gas no this
one<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.140> Texan<00:02:28.470> one<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.800> there<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> gas<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
one the Texan one on there is a gas and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.990 
one the Texan one on there is a gas and
I<00:02:30.000> turn<00:02:30.209> around<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.930> I'm<00:02:31.140> looking<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I turn around and I'm looking at it and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.760 
I turn around and I'm looking at it and
then<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.300> will<00:02:33.450> place<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> redstone<00:02:33.930> block<00:02:34.290> over

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
then it will place a redstone block over

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.830 
then it will place a redstone block over
here<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.250> turn<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> gas<00:02:36.090> into<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> wall<00:02:36.690> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
here and turn the gas into the wall and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020 
here and turn the gas into the wall and
then<00:02:36.990> vice<00:02:37.620> versa<00:02:37.650> these<00:02:38.190> detect<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:38.820> I'm

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
then vice versa these detect when I'm

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.650 
then vice versa these detect when I'm
looking<00:02:39.510> away<00:02:39.690> from<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.620> wither<00:02:40.800> skull<00:02:41.660> and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
looking away from the wither skull and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.560 
looking away from the wither skull and
then<00:02:43.050> it'll<00:02:43.260> summon<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> gas<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
then it'll summon the gas so the way I

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.949 
then it'll summon the gas so the way I
do<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> nested<00:02:46.739> execute<00:02:47.340> command<00:02:47.959> so

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
do this is a nested execute command so

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.979 
do this is a nested execute command so
we<00:02:48.989> have<00:02:49.230> first<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.830> all<00:02:49.950> execute<00:02:50.600> at<00:02:51.600> player

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
we have first of all execute at player

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.910 
we have first of all execute at player
and<00:02:52.200> then<00:02:52.290> between<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.610> specific<00:02:54.150> rotation<00:02:54.920> and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and then between a specific rotation and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.030 
and then between a specific rotation and
then<00:02:56.340> 50<00:02:56.700> blocks<00:02:56.880> away

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
then 50 blocks away

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.979 
then 50 blocks away
these<00:02:59.040> fifties<00:02:59.640> change<00:02:59.970> depending<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
these fifties change depending on the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.280 
these fifties change depending on the
rotation<00:03:01.470> I'm<00:03:01.590> specifying<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.370> that's<00:03:02.489> how<00:03:02.670> I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
rotation I'm specifying and that's how I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.810 
rotation I'm specifying and that's how I
achieve<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:05.010> specific<00:03:05.489> directions

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
achieve the like specific directions

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.170 
achieve the like specific directions
that<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.269> player<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.540> facing<00:03:07.910> but<00:03:08.910> then<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
that the player is facing but then the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.050 
that the player is facing but then the
next<00:03:09.420> execute<00:03:09.870> command<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.410> at<00:03:11.370> any<00:03:11.820> gas

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
next execute command is at any gas

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.289 
next execute command is at any gas
within<00:03:12.540> 50<00:03:13.230> blocks<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:13.890> direction<00:03:14.299> and

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
within 50 blocks of that direction and

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.330 
within 50 blocks of that direction and
this<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.510> limited<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.140> 50<00:03:16.470> blocks<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:17.070> as<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
this is limited to 50 blocks so as a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
this is limited to 50 blocks so as a
result<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.790> doesn't<00:03:18.090> work<00:03:18.209> from<00:03:18.450> far<00:03:18.780> away

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
result this doesn't work from far away

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.460 
result this doesn't work from far away
or<00:03:19.049> very<00:03:19.380> close<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.160> kinda<00:03:21.120> imprecise<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:21.840> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
or very close so kinda imprecise but it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.949 
or very close so kinda imprecise but it
gets<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.769> job<00:03:22.799> done<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.280> then<00:03:23.880> if<00:03:24.690> it

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
gets the job done and then if it

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.170 
gets the job done and then if it
basically<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.010> managed<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.459> if<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.030> manages

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
basically if it managed if if it manages

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.500 
basically if it managed if if it manages
to<00:03:27.630> find<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.959> gas<00:03:28.519> within<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.670> 50<00:03:29.970> blocks<00:03:30.209> away

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
to find a gas within the 50 blocks away

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.479 
to find a gas within the 50 blocks away
from<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.930> player<00:03:31.140> facing<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.040> specific

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
from the player facing in that specific

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.210 
from the player facing in that specific
rotation<00:03:33.390> then<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.380> will<00:03:34.500> place<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.980> redstone

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
rotation then it will place a redstone

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.660 
rotation then it will place a redstone
block<00:03:35.489> over<00:03:36.390> here<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.829> then<00:03:38.340> these<00:03:38.489> pretty

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
block over here and then these pretty

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.490 
block over here and then these pretty
much<00:03:38.820> do<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.060> same<00:03:39.239> thing<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:39.750> place<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.350> red

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
much do the same thing but place the red

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.490 
much do the same thing but place the red
Sun<00:03:40.680> block<00:03:40.829> in<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.040> other<00:03:41.190> spot<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.700> yeah<00:03:42.660> so

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
Sun block in the other spot and yeah so

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.060 
Sun block in the other spot and yeah so
start<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.040> clock<00:03:44.310> up<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:45.709> see<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.860> stays

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
start this clock up and see that stays

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.640 
start this clock up and see that stays
the<00:03:47.250> same<00:03:47.450> going<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.570> f5<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.170> can<00:03:49.350> see<00:03:49.500> behind

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
the same going to f5 so I can see behind

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.550 
the same going to f5 so I can see behind
me<00:03:49.910> Oh<00:03:50.910> actually<00:03:51.780> yeah<00:03:52.019> there<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.290> go<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.440> see

them too close to it and yeah once I get
far<00:03:55.350> enough<00:03:55.440> away<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.860> will<00:03:55.950> work<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.720> yeah

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
far enough away it will work so yeah

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.990 
far enough away it will work so yeah
