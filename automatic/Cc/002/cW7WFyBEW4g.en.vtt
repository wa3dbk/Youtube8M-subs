tech armor set which is 0 and this Felix

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.540 
tech armor set which is 0 and this Felix
that<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.350> light<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:27.750> maegi<00:01:28.740> check<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that is light and this maegi check is

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.280 
that is light and this maegi check is
the<00:01:30.540> medium<00:01:31.910> so<00:01:32.910> so<00:01:33.330> let's<00:01:33.690> have<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> look<00:01:34.050> at

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the medium so so let's have a look at

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.730 
the medium so so let's have a look at
that<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:40.610> as<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that and as you can see it has the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.510 
that and as you can see it has the
steampunk<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:46.340> give<00:01:47.340> or

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
steampunk going to it I think give or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.620 
steampunk going to it I think give or
two<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:48.060> getting<00:01:48.750> more<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.770> punkish

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
two are getting more more in punkish

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.180 
two are getting more more in punkish

well I don't have any problems with that
