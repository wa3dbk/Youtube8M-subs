scene ej timer it plays and it starts

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.220 
scene ej timer it plays and it starts
counting<00:00:25.120> down<00:00:25.360> but<00:00:25.630> you<00:00:25.720> don't<00:00:25.900> see<00:00:26.080> any

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
counting down but you don't see any

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.100 
counting down but you don't see any
waveform<00:00:26.770> here<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.420> negative<00:00:28.900> time

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
waveform here and the negative time

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.970 
waveform here and the negative time
actually<00:00:29.350> counts<00:00:30.039> up<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:32.259> what<00:00:32.439> is<00:00:32.469> causing

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
actually counts up so what is causing

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.970 
actually counts up so what is causing
this<00:00:33.219> issue<00:00:33.929> well<00:00:34.929> in<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.230> setup<00:00:35.499> menu<00:00:35.620> on<00:00:35.920> the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
vinyl control tab there are these two

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.139 
vinyl control tab there are these two
knobs<00:00:38.710> right<00:00:38.859> here<00:00:39.159> labeled<00:00:39.370> vinyl<00:00:39.850> start

knobs right here labeled vinyl start
offset<00:00:40.589> these<00:00:41.589> were<00:00:41.769> implemented<00:00:42.309> mainly

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
offset these were implemented mainly

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.869 
offset these were implemented mainly
from<00:00:42.789> the<00:00:42.909> vinyl<00:00:43.120> DJ's<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.839> prevent<00:00:44.460> Q<00:00:45.460> burn<00:00:45.640> on

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
from the vinyl DJ's to prevent Q burn on

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.399 
from the vinyl DJ's to prevent Q burn on
their<00:00:46.120> control<00:00:46.629> records<00:00:46.839> because<00:00:47.170> obviously

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
their control records because obviously

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.169 
their control records because obviously
with<00:00:47.829> scratch<00:00:48.069> like<00:00:48.309> you're<00:00:48.550> using<00:00:48.729> the<00:00:48.879> same

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
with scratch like you're using the same

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.809 
with scratch like you're using the same
record<00:00:49.659> for<00:00:49.929> every<00:00:50.890> song<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.280> play<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:51.789> you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:51.819 
record for every song you play and you

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.509 
record for every song you play and you
know<00:00:52.600> it's<00:00:52.780> vinyl<00:00:53.409> DJ<00:00:53.800> so<00:00:53.859> they<00:00:54.010> like<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:54.339> put

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
know it's vinyl DJ so they like to put

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.619 
know it's vinyl DJ so they like to put
the<00:00:54.609> nail<00:00:54.729> at<00:00:54.819> the<00:00:54.879> beginning<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.449> know

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
the nail at the beginning and you know

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.569 
the nail at the beginning and you know
stretch<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.229> cue<00:00:56.649> it<00:00:56.769> up<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.039> whatnot<00:00:57.190> and

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
stretch and cue it up and whatnot and

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.520 
stretch and cue it up and whatnot and
back<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.269> beginning<00:00:58.389> that<00:00:58.690> causes<00:00:59.170> cuber

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
back to the beginning that causes cuber

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.399 
back to the beginning that causes cuber
and<00:00:59.559> on<00:00:59.739> vinyl<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.729> those<00:01:00.879> knobs<00:01:01.120> were

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
and on vinyl so those knobs were

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.070 
and on vinyl so those knobs were
implemented<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:03.390> push<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.629> start<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:05.020> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
implemented to push the start of the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.160 
implemented to push the start of the
track<00:01:05.290> further<00:01:05.680> into<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.340> vinyl<00:01:06.700> so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
track further into the vinyl so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.260 
track further into the vinyl so
effectively<00:01:08.310> skipping<00:01:09.310> over<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.820> cue<00:01:10.060> burn

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
effectively skipping over the cue burn

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.560 
effectively skipping over the cue burn
part<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:10.750> vinyl<00:01:11.370> however<00:01:12.370> this<00:01:12.670> causes

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
part of the vinyl however this causes

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.230 
part of the vinyl however this causes
some<00:01:13.750> confusions<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.680> issues<00:01:15.460> with<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.120> new
