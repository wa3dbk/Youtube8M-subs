Dorsey<00:00:43.200> well<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> complexity<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.399> happens

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
Dorsey well the complexity what happens

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
Dorsey well the complexity what happens
is<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> these<00:00:45.180> cars<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.660> very<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.260> equal

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is that these cars are very very equal

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
is that these cars are very very equal
in<00:00:46.829> their<00:00:46.950> speeds<00:00:47.309> around<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.760> racetrack<00:00:47.969> no

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
in their speeds around this racetrack no

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.880 
in their speeds around this racetrack no
doubt<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.930> where<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.680> their

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
doubt about it where they get their

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.889 
doubt about it where they get their
speed<00:00:50.190> however<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.760> completely<00:00:51.300> different<00:00:51.719> on

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
speed however is completely different on

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
speed however is completely different on
restarts<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.829> always<00:00:53.010> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> goes<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
restarts that always kind of goes in the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
restarts that always kind of goes in the
