confusing unless you're here right from
the<00:00:36.390> start<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.020> breaking<00:00:37.980> things<00:00:38.190> down<00:00:38.309> now

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

the first way you can watch the series

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.340 
the first way you can watch the series
is<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:41.309> chronological<00:00:42.300> order<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.930> from

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
is in chronological order so from

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.889 
is in chronological order so from
fallout<00:00:44.129> 3<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.850> where<00:00:45.120> Logan's<00:00:45.600> tale

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
fallout 3 which is where Logan's tale
starts<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.430> until<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.210> end

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
starts right up until the very very end

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.970 
starts right up until the very very end
but<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> might<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.649> asking<00:00:49.920> yourself

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
but then you might be asking yourself

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.490 
but then you might be asking yourself
why<00:00:50.910> didn't<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.210> start<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> beginning<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
why didn't I start from the beginning in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.090 
why didn't I start from the beginning in
the<00:00:53.219> beginning<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:55.530> reasons

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the beginning and I I have my reasons

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.250 
the beginning and I I have my reasons
for<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.879> hope<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:58.020> think

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
for it and I hope that you will think

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
for it and I hope that you will think
that<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:58.500> make<00:00:58.710> sense<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.699> when<00:01:00.329> Logan

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that they make sense to see when Logan

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.930 
that they make sense to see when Logan
begins<00:01:01.020> his<00:01:01.170> journey<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.800> New<00:01:02.190> Vegas<00:01:02.399> it's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
away but eventually on his journey

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
away but eventually on his journey
throughout<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> mojave<00:01:21.060> he<00:01:21.869> comes<00:01:22.229> across<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
throughout the mojave he comes across a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.390 
throughout the mojave he comes across a
way<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:24.479> him<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> all<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
way for him to get that all back and so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.859 
way for him to get that all back and so
when<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> first<00:01:26.790> started<00:01:26.939> making<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.479> series<00:01:27.780> I

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
when I first started making a series I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.090 
when I first started making a series I
knew<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> chance<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:28.979> would

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
knew there was a chance that he would

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.850 
knew there was a chance that he would
get<00:01:29.340> recollection<00:01:30.150> memories<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.170> who<00:01:31.380> he<00:01:31.619> was

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
get recollection memories of who he was

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.539 
get recollection memories of who he was
before

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
before

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
before
I<00:01:32.579> hope<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.450> understand<00:01:33.900> why<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
I hope then you can understand why I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
I hope then you can understand why I
wanted<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> show<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.220> part<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.090> his<00:01:36.210> life

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
wanted to show that part of his life

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.499 
wanted to show that part of his life
first<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.130> was<00:01:38.549> really<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.240> new

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
first because it was really a new

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
first because it was really a new
beginning<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.990> him<00:01:40.290> he<00:01:40.799> didn't<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.220> any<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
beginning for him he didn't have any of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.310 
beginning for him he didn't have any of
those<00:01:41.640> memories<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.720> didn't<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.140> those

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
those memories and we didn't have those

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740 
those memories and we didn't have those
memories<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.040> his<00:01:44.159> viewers<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.790> well<00:01:44.820> even<00:01:45.600> me

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
memories of his viewers as well even me

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
memories of his viewers as well even me
as<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> player<00:01:46.259> who's<00:01:46.560> controlling<00:01:46.950> them<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
as the player who's controlling them I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
as the player who's controlling them I
think<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> would<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.790> far<00:01:48.060> too<00:01:48.090> tempting<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
think it would be far too tempting to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.200 
think it would be far too tempting to
recall<00:01:49.290> certain<00:01:49.770> things<00:01:50.070> or<00:01:50.310> abilities<00:01:50.850> or

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
recall certain things or abilities or

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.389 
recall certain things or abilities or
knowledge<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.409> Logan<00:01:52.860> had<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.280> this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
knowledge that Logan had in this

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.679 
knowledge that Logan had in this
previous<00:01:53.850> life<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> would<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.479> been<00:01:54.570> unfair

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
previous life it would have been unfair

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.420 
previous life it would have been unfair
it<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.680> broken<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.250> roleplay

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it really would have broken the roleplay

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
it really would have broken the roleplay
so<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> hope<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> better

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so I hope that that kind of better

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.069 
so I hope that that kind of better
