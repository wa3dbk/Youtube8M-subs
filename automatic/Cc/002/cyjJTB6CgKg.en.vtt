definitely<00:02:33.900> definitely<00:02:34.050> one<00:02:34.350> particularly<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
definitely definitely one particularly a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.610 
definitely definitely one particularly a
dirted<00:02:35.220> tank<00:02:35.520> like<00:02:35.970> say<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> finer<00:02:36.960> substrate

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
dirted tank like say a finer substrate

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.040 
dirted tank like say a finer substrate
though<00:02:37.830> because<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.490> got<00:02:38.610> smaller<00:02:39.000> roots<00:02:39.450> so

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
though because it's got smaller roots so

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.510 
though because it's got smaller roots so
we<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.320> push<00:02:40.530> down<00:02:40.560> through<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> finer<00:02:41.280> stuff

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
we can push down through the finer stuff

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.890 
we can push down through the finer stuff
should<00:02:41.670> definitely<00:02:42.180> dirt<00:02:42.360> underneath<00:02:42.660> it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900

greenhouse here okay so you got to

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.180 
greenhouse here okay so you got to
duplicate<00:04:27.410> that<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.620> your<00:04:27.740> tank<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.919> got<00:04:28.070> to

then more importantly you got to

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.969 
then more importantly you got to
duplicate<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.900> little<00:04:33.380> plant<00:04:33.620> might
