bit of cleanup make it easy for us to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.849 
bit of cleanup make it easy for us to
see<00:00:15.179> where<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.970> which<00:00:17.970> leads<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.800> so<00:00:19.800> we

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
see where the which leads what so we

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.029 
see where the which leads what so we
don't<00:00:20.010> make<00:00:20.160> any<00:00:20.310> mistakes<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:22.500> put<00:00:22.949> some

the engine through that positive so what

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.780 
the engine through that positive so what
we<00:01:16.590> need<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> make<00:01:17.100> sure<00:01:17.189> we've<00:01:17.280> got<00:01:17.310> 24

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
we need to do to make sure we've got 24

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
we need to do to make sure we've got 24
volts<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.720> pick<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> ground<00:01:21.180> wire<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.890> the

volts is pick up the ground wire and the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
volts is pick up the ground wire and the
output<00:01:23.189> positive<00:01:23.580> wire<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.930> right

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
output positive wire will do that right

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.890 
output positive wire will do that right
now<00:01:25.880> checking<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.060> sure<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.450> our<00:01:27.570> leads

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
now checking to make sure that our leads

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.130 
now checking to make sure that our leads
are<00:01:28.490> separated<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:31.020> if

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
are separated so we don't know if

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.340 
are separated so we don't know if
they'll<00:01:31.259> leave<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> together<00:01:33.380> black<00:01:34.380> brand

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350

down our second truck
our<00:01:59.080> second<00:01:59.409> trucks<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.650> bit<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.890> trick

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
our second trucks a bit of a trick

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.450 
our second trucks a bit of a trick
because<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:02.140> bridge<00:02:02.380> wires<00:02:02.680> on<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.040> outside

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
because the bridge wires on the outside

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.240 
because the bridge wires on the outside
of<00:02:04.030> both<00:02:04.210> batteries<00:02:04.750> but<00:02:05.560> that's<00:02:05.710> okay<00:02:06.040> what

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
of both batteries but that's okay what

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.790 
of both batteries but that's okay what
we're<00:02:06.369> looking<00:02:06.580> for<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> negative<00:02:08.350> terminal

here that negative terminal is running

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.220 
here that negative terminal is running
away<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> truck<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:14.020> positive

away to the truck and that positive
terminal<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.069> running<00:02:15.430> away<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.880> truck<00:02:16.120> so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
terminal is running away to the truck so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.900 
terminal is running away to the truck so
we<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.380> assume<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.980> that's<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.670> output

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
we can assume that that's the output

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.060 
we can assume that that's the output
positive<00:02:19.769> that's<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.040> ground<00:02:21.940> negative

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
positive that's the ground negative

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.000 
positive that's the ground negative
we're<00:02:24.070> taking<00:02:24.430> out<00:02:24.519> negative<00:02:25.060> wire<00:02:26.010> coming

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
we're taking out negative wire coming

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.850 
we're taking out negative wire coming
from<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.310> donor<00:02:27.519> truck<00:02:28.230> being<00:02:29.230> careful<00:02:29.680> not<00:02:29.769> to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
from a donor truck being careful not to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.160 
from a donor truck being careful not to
touch<00:02:30.010> any<00:02:30.040> metal<00:02:30.310> surfaces<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:31.930> hook<00:02:32.080> it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
touch any metal surfaces and we hook it

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.199 
touch any metal surfaces and we hook it
up<00:02:33.090> okay<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.600> positive<00:02:34.959> terminal<00:02:36.209> again

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
up okay and a positive terminal again

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.780 
up okay and a positive terminal again
being<00:02:37.780> careful<00:02:38.019> not<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.560> contact<00:02:39.459> anything

being careful not to contact anything
else<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:41.140> we<00:02:41.830> put<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.100> on<00:02:42.190> okay<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:45.130> one<00:02:45.310> last

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
else and we put it on okay so one last

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.900 
else and we put it on okay so one last
check<00:02:45.790> before<00:02:45.819> we<00:02:46.150> do<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.390> Isolators<00:02:47.910> output

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
check before we do the Isolators output

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.760 
check before we do the Isolators output
positive<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.620> output<00:02:50.650> positive

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
positive the output positive

ground negative to ground negative okay
we<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.020> now<00:02:58.110> turn<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.530> truck<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.950> and<00:03:01.070> start

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
we can now turn this truck on and start

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.480 
we can now turn this truck on and start
her<00:03:02.130> up

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
her up

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.640 
her up
there's<00:03:03.000> no<00:03:03.240> need<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> turn<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.810> truck<00:03:04.050> on<00:03:04.260> we

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
there's no need to turn this truck on we

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
there's no need to turn this truck on we

running power back into that truck as

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.770 
running power back into that truck as
soon<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.710> we<00:03:13.770> let's<00:03:13.950> start<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.310> up<00:03:14.600> we'll<00:03:15.600> take

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
soon as we let's start it up we'll take

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.340 
soon as we let's start it up we'll take
the<00:03:15.900> negative<00:03:16.230> terminal<00:03:16.590> off<00:03:16.790> our<00:03:17.790> track<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
the negative terminal off our track and

the positive terminal off put the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.940 
the positive terminal off put the

negative lead on the ground and remove
it<00:03:26.070> from<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.550> donor<00:03:26.730> truck<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.590> we're<00:03:28.710> good

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
it from the donor truck and we're good

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.950 
it from the donor truck and we're good
to<00:03:28.860> go
