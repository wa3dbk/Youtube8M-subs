00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
avoid the Ranger and Robin just because

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.280 
avoid the Ranger and Robin just because
I<00:02:47.489> tend<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.269> Robins<00:02:48.569> helps<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> bad<00:02:49.049> but<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I tend the Robins helps you bad but the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.900 
I tend the Robins helps you bad but the
ranges<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.709> tend<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.040> get<00:02:50.129> stuck<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.609> them<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
ranges I tend to get stuck with them and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.490 
ranges I tend to get stuck with them and
then<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> Morrow's<00:02:51.359> get<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.840> margins<00:02:52.349> get

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
then the Morrow's get the margins get

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.960 
then the Morrow's get the margins get
narrowed<00:02:52.799> down<00:02:52.829> really<00:02:53.160> quickly<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.819> end

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
narrowed down really quickly and I end

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.780
