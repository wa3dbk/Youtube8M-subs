00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I thought that I would have a hair

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
I thought that I would have a hair
makeup<00:01:09.840> station<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.159> front

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
makeup station right there at the front

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 
makeup station right there at the front
um<00:01:12.060> originally<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.530> lots<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
um originally was going to put lots of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
um originally was going to put lots of
makeup<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.490> lots<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> knickknacks<00:01:15.330> hanging

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
makeup and lots of knickknacks hanging

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.890 
makeup and lots of knickknacks hanging
around<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.549> realistically<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
around but realistically it's just a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.450 
around but realistically it's just a
little<00:01:19.080> bit<00:01:19.200> too<00:01:19.380> much<00:01:19.530> clutter<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.159> such<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
little bit too much clutter for such a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.850 
little bit too much clutter for such a
small<00:01:20.700> room<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.540> went<00:01:22.020> ahead<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.590> put

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
small room so I went ahead and just put

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
small room so I went ahead and just put
in<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.299> director's<00:01:24.299> chair<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.869> she<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.170> sit

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
in a director's chair that she can sit

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
in a director's chair that she can sit
on<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> put<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> shelf<00:01:26.729> right

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
on and then I put a shelf right

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
on and then I put a shelf right
underneath<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.409> she<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.770> place

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
underneath and that way she can place

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.310 
underneath and that way she can place
all<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.430> her<00:01:29.520> cameras<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> the

quite<00:01:39.180> nice<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.549> now<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:41.909> actually<00:01:42.180> just

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
quite nice so now I'm actually just

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.080 
quite nice so now I'm actually just
looking<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> video<00:01:43.619> camera<00:01:44.100> which<00:01:44.670> was

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
looking for the video camera which was

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.480 
looking for the video camera which was
virtually<00:01:45.780> impossible<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.380> find<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> just

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
virtually impossible to find so I just

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
virtually impossible to find so I just
went<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.000> camera<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
went with this camera that I was like a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.730 
went with this camera that I was like a
DSLR<00:01:50.040> camera<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.020> left<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.500> just

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
DSLR camera and I just left it with just

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.190 
DSLR camera and I just left it with just
one<00:01:52.950> rack<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> living<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> closet

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
one rack in the living in the closet

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.399 
one rack in the living in the closet
actually<00:01:56.240> yeah<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.750> thought<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:58.170> rack

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
actually yeah I just thought one rack

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
actually yeah I just thought one rack
would<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.680> nice<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.219> when<00:01:59.850> people<00:02:00.000> try

would be nice you know when people try

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.670 
would be nice you know when people try
