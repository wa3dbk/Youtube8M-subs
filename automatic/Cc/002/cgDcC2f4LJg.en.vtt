00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
go and it's quite a snot kind of a

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.709 
go and it's quite a snot kind of a
surprise<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:08.280> me<00:00:08.429> but<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:08.940> never<00:00:09.269> count<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
surprise for me but I never count the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.720 
surprise for me but I never count the
days<00:00:09.900> otherwise<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.710> gets<00:00:10.830> too<00:00:11.130> difficult<00:00:11.340> for

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
days otherwise it gets too difficult for

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.160 
days otherwise it gets too difficult for
the<00:00:11.940> event<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.330> take<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:12.809> day<00:00:12.840> at<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> time

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the event we take it one day at a time

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.440 
the event we take it one day at a time
and<00:00:13.769> before<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.460> blink<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> wrong<00:00:15.240> day

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
and before you blink it's the wrong day

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.769 
and before you blink it's the wrong day
to<00:00:15.480> go<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.980> date<00:00:17.160> stage<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> typical

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
to go so the date stage was a typical

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.260 
to go so the date stage was a typical
sort<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.710> World<00:00:20.070> Rally<00:00:20.310> Championship<00:00:20.850> stage

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
sort of World Rally Championship stage

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.870 
sort of World Rally Championship stage
in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> mountains<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:23.220> juniel<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.760> was

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
in the mountains but for juniel it was

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.810 
in the mountains but for juniel it was
really<00:00:24.210> very<00:00:24.240> much<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> case<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.199> just

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
really very much a case of just

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.980 
really very much a case of just
transversing<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> stage<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.420> no<00:00:27.449> troubles

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
transversing the stage with no troubles

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
transversing the stage with no troubles
and<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.230> course<00:00:28.439> he<00:00:28.560> did<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.920> perfectly<00:00:29.130> he

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and of course he did that perfectly he

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.460 
and of course he did that perfectly he
lost<00:00:30.150> probably<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.689> little<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:30.990> more<00:00:31.170> time

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
lost probably a little bit more time

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
lost probably a little bit more time
than<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.859> would<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.009> expected<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.880> he's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
than we would have expected but he's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.540 
than we would have expected but he's
safe<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> that's<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.170> counts<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:35.190> Leroy

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
safe and that's what counts for Leroy

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000 
safe and that's what counts for Leroy
I'm<00:00:35.850> afraid<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.200> asked<00:00:37.500> him<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
I'm afraid what we asked him to do the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.420 
I'm afraid what we asked him to do the

in the right place the roads in the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.740 
in the right place the roads in the
right<00:01:34.950> condition<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.000> know<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> end<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
right condition you know it's the end of

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.090 
right condition you know it's the end of
the<00:01:36.810> deck<00:01:37.020> are<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.350> won't<00:01:37.530> want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.829> big

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the deck are we won't want to take big

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
the deck are we won't want to take big
risks<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.659> they've<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> speed

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
risks but I think they've got the speed

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
risks but I think they've got the speed
to<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.400> we've<00:01:41.579> got<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> team

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
to do it and then we've got the team

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.719 
to do it and then we've got the team
