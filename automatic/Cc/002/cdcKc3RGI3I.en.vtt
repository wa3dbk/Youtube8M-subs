00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and I've defeated them and it will

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.090 
and I've defeated them and it will
change<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.850> pc<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.539> maybe<00:01:57.840> awesome<00:01:58.100> new

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
change for pc so maybe awesome new

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
change for pc so maybe awesome new
bosses<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> actually<00:02:00.060> fight<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:00.689> some<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
bosses to actually fight because some of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.599 
bosses to actually fight because some of
the<00:02:01.109> bosses<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.740> actually<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.429> boring

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
the bosses are actually kind of boring

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.069 
the bosses are actually kind of boring
at<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> moment<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.659> awesome<00:02:04.049> maybe

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
at the moment they be awesome maybe

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.639 
at the moment they be awesome maybe
adding<00:02:04.740> new<00:02:05.009> bosses<00:02:05.609> so<00:02:06.090> yeah<00:02:06.359> so<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.530> only

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
adding new bosses so yeah so it only

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.609 
adding new bosses so yeah so it only
says<00:02:08.009> much<00:02:08.280> much<00:02:08.520> more<00:02:08.759> body<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.509> rest<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.289> think

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
says much much more body to rest I think

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.009 
says much much more body to rest I think
it'd<00:02:10.740> be<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:10.920> fun<00:02:11.519> new<00:02:12.510> updates<00:02:12.900> are

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
it'd be really fun new updates are

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:13.820 
it'd be really fun new updates are
coming<00:02:13.050> out<00:02:13.319> because

Luke<00:02:38.130> games<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.000> predicted<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
Luke games that you predicted kind of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.200 
Luke games that you predicted kind of
that<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.920> will<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.130> coming<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.940> fifth

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
that it will be coming out on the fifth

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.960 
that it will be coming out on the fifth
of<00:02:42.330> november<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.500> year<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.640> kind<00:02:44.880> of

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
of november this year so that's kind of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.000 
of november this year so that's kind of
far<00:02:45.660> away<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.200> Torres<00:02:46.500> it'd<00:02:46.680> probably<00:02:46.890> be

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
far away but Torres it'd probably be

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.490 
far away but Torres it'd probably be
quick<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.820> they<00:02:48.480> found<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.870> out<00:02:49.050> because<00:02:49.260> of

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
quick and they found this out because of

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.410 
quick and they found this out because of
the<00:02:49.620> code<00:02:49.920> at<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> beginning<00:02:50.910> by<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.180> loading

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the code at the beginning by the loading

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.210 
the code at the beginning by the loading
screen<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:52.110> gets<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> main<00:02:52.530> menu<00:02:52.709> actually

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
screen that gets the main menu actually

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.510 
screen that gets the main menu actually
on<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.550> console<00:02:54.890> there<00:02:55.890> was<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> little<00:02:56.250> code

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
on the console there was a little code

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.250 
on the console there was a little code
that<00:02:56.760> came<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.360> mon<00:02:57.600> put<00:02:57.780> get<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.080> free

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
that came out on mon put get for free

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.500 
that came out on mon put get for free
well<00:02:59.010> i<00:02:59.040> guess<00:02:59.340> the<00:03:00.050> first<00:03:01.050> part<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:02.510> torero

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
well i guess the first part of torero

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.290 
well i guess the first part of torero
console<00:03:04.050> but<00:03:04.709> um<00:03:04.920> yeah<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:06.060> probably

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
console but um yeah so you can probably

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.140 
console but um yeah so you can probably
check<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.600> out<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.340> yeah<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.670> faintly<00:03:09.000> this

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
check that out and yeah so faintly this

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.790 
check that out and yeah so faintly this
could<00:03:09.300> be<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> end<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.870> video<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.650> not

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
could be the end of it video it's not

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.350 
could be the end of it video it's not
