00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
yellows of the power supply put them

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.400 
yellows of the power supply put them
together<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.730> take<00:00:53.969> two<00:00:54.300> blacks<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
together you take two blacks from the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.580 
together you take two blacks from the
power<00:00:55.649> supply<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.360> black<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> radio

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
power supply with the black of the radio

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.720 
power supply with the black of the radio
and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.609> put<00:00:59.879> those<00:01:00.090> together<00:01:01.399> another<00:01:02.399> step

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and you put those together another step

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
and you put those together another step
to<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> power<00:01:03.600> supply<00:01:03.930> work<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
to make the power supply work is you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640 
to make the power supply work is you
take<00:01:05.159> any<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.640> black<00:01:06.119> wires<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.530> see

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
take any other black wires that you see

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.480 
take any other black wires that you see
in<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.580> from<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> power<00:01:09.540> supply<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:11.159> put

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
in the from the power supply and you put

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.100 
in the from the power supply and you put
it<00:01:11.610> together<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:13.049> green<00:01:13.470> power<00:01:14.340> supply

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
it together with the green power supply

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.340 
it together with the green power supply
okay

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
okay

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.370 
okay
so<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> black<00:01:17.460> power<00:01:17.880> supply<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.140> green

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
so a black power supply with the green

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.999 
so a black power supply with the green
power<00:01:19.590> supply<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.939> them<00:01:21.119> together<00:01:22.009> that's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
power supply put them together that's

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.780 
power supply put them together that's
what<00:01:23.220> makes<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.610> power<00:01:24.090> supply<00:01:24.450> turn<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
what makes the power supply turn on and

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.249 
what makes the power supply turn on and
obviously<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.299> connect<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> power

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
obviously you have to connect the power

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
obviously you have to connect the power
supply<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:29.400> an<00:01:29.549> outlet<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:32.210> then<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.540> next

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
supply to an outlet and then the next

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.219 
supply to an outlet and then the next
step<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.549> either<00:01:36.090> coat<00:01:36.509> hanger<00:01:36.900> or

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
step is just take either coat hanger or

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
step is just take either coat hanger or
anything<00:01:37.680> metal<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.759> inside<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
anything metal you put inside the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.289 
anything metal you put inside the
antenna<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.950> let<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.159> kind<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> pop<00:01:42.119> up

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
antenna and just let it kind of pop up

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
antenna and just let it kind of pop up
and<00:01:42.509> that's<00:01:42.659> where<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:42.990> your<00:01:43.460> radio

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and that's where you get your radio

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.679 
and that's where you get your radio
stations<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:46.130> one<00:01:47.130> last<00:01:47.369> step<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
stations and one last step is for you to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.060 
stations and one last step is for you to
hear<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.170> music<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.450> gotta<00:01:51.829> do<00:01:52.829> some

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
hear the music so you gotta do some

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.190 
hear the music so you gotta do some
fishing<00:01:53.399> around<00:01:53.670> take<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:54.390> wire<00:01:54.570> fishing<00:01:55.110> up

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
fishing around take some wire fishing up

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
fishing around take some wire fishing up
the<00:01:55.290> wall<00:01:55.500> wherever<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.729> speaker
