again<00:04:29.300> step<00:04:29.600> up<00:04:29.750> but<00:04:29.900> seems<00:04:30.380> quite<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.590> nice

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
again step up but seems quite a nice

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800 
again step up but seems quite a nice
mixture<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> really<00:04:32.120> nice<00:04:32.360> mixture<00:04:32.720> and

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
mixture it is a really nice mixture and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.300 
mixture it is a really nice mixture and
then<00:04:32.900> twenty<00:04:33.260> ones<00:04:33.410> did<00:04:33.590> really<00:04:33.860> well<00:04:33.980> last

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
then twenty ones did really well last

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.430 
then twenty ones did really well last
year<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.670> a<00:04:34.700> lot<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:34.940> these<00:04:35.030> guys<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.360> think<00:04:35.660> 13

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
year and a lot of these guys I think 13

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.920 
year and a lot of these guys I think 13
of<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.770> tiny<00:04:37.070> ones<00:04:37.370> are<00:04:37.640> backup<00:04:38.300> fina<00:04:38.750> they're

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
of the tiny ones are backup fina they're

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.930 
of the tiny ones are backup fina they're
on<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.140> 21<00:04:39.530> but<00:04:39.830> they're<00:04:39.980> also<00:04:40.130> being<00:04:40.640> blended

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
on to 21 but they're also being blended

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.270 
on to 21 but they're also being blended
into<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.510> first<00:04:41.780> team<00:04:41.990> here<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.950> second

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
into the first team here and the second

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.160 
into the first team here and the second
team<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.850> there's<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.240> lot<00:04:44.450> of<00:04:44.480> enthusiastic

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
team and there's a lot of enthusiastic

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.620 
team and there's a lot of enthusiastic
that's<00:04:45.470> great<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.770> see<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.940> again<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> few<00:04:47.450> old

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
that's great to see and again a few old

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.410 
that's great to see and again a few old
heads<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.620> few<00:04:48.800> very<00:04:49.130> old<00:04:49.340> heads<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.000> I

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
heads and a few very old heads and I

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.300 
heads and a few very old heads and I
think<00:04:51.260> with<00:04:51.350> eight<00:04:51.500> blues<00:04:51.770> left<00:04:52.040> from<00:04:52.190> last

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
think with eight blues left from last

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.580 
think with eight blues left from last
year<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:52.820> that's<00:04:53.000> good<00:04:53.180> as<00:04:53.330> well<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:54.170> key<00:04:54.410> is

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
year so that's good as well the key is

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.880 
year so that's good as well the key is
actually<00:04:54.980> every<00:04:55.550> year<00:04:55.970> it's<00:04:56.420> a<00:04:56.540> team<00:04:57.320> dynamics

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
actually every year it's a team dynamics

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.380 
actually every year it's a team dynamics
and<00:04:58.130> you<00:04:58.250> get<00:04:58.400> different<00:04:58.640> characters<00:04:59.240> you

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
and you get different characters you

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.450 
and you get different characters you
have<00:04:59.570> to<00:04:59.690> try<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.230> blend<00:05:00.440> them<00:05:00.620> within<00:05:01.190> either

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
have to try and blend them within either

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.910 
have to try and blend them within either
12<00:05:01.850> or<00:05:02.000> 13<00:05:02.390> week<00:05:02.600> so<00:05:02.810> it's<00:05:02.960> quite<00:05:03.140> big<00:05:03.320> ass<00:05:03.530> in
