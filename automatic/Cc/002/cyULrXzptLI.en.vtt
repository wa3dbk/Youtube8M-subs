00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
which is when flat textures kind of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.889 
which is when flat textures kind of
interact<00:00:38.640> weirdly<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.239> each<00:00:39.360> other<00:00:39.600> and

glitch and you know how it used to look

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.630 
glitch and you know how it used to look
all<00:00:42.540> staticky<00:00:43.050> well<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.710> looks<00:00:44.010> very<00:00:44.370> nice

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
all staticky well now it looks very nice

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and you can see it from very far away

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.549 
and you can see it from very far away
not<00:00:46.920> staticky<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> other

sanded<00:00:54.390> blocks<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.989> used<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.829> basically

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
sanded blocks are used so basically

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
sanded blocks are used so basically
following<00:00:56.820> sand<00:00:57.059> blocks<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> may<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.570> seen

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
following sand blocks you may have seen

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.299 
following sand blocks you may have seen
like<00:00:57.930> sethbling<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.530> stuff<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.890> done<00:00:59.100> this

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
like sethbling and stuff have done this

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
like sethbling and stuff have done this
you<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.300> could<00:01:00.449> drop<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> sand<00:01:01.170> block<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you they could drop a sand block and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
you they could drop a sand block and
they<00:01:01.920> could<00:01:02.100> make<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.359> appearance

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
they could make it have the appearance

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.230 
they could make it have the appearance
or<00:01:04.260> act<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.769> turn<00:01:05.010> into<00:01:05.040> another<00:01:05.700> block

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
or act it would turn into another block

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.719 
or act it would turn into another block
if<00:01:07.049> edited<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.920> spawned<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.580> way

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
if edited and like spawned in that way

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
if edited and like spawned in that way
but<00:01:09.240> now<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.320> entities

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
but now you can do that with entities

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.090 
but now you can do that with entities
like<00:01:11.430> chests<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> dispenser<00:01:13.140> signs<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
like chests and dispenser signs all this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.460 
like chests and dispenser signs all this
stuff<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.060> spawn<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.140> with

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
stuff but you could spawn these in with

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
stuff but you could spawn these in with
things<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.189> chests<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:17.970> have

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
things in the chests so you can have

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
things in the chests so you can have
like<00:01:18.270> chests<00:01:18.630> rain<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.710> sky<00:01:19.979> with

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
like chests rain from this the sky with

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
like chests rain from this the sky with
diamonds<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.909> could<00:01:21.030> keep<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.479> data<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
diamonds you could keep that data in the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
diamonds you could keep that data in the
block<00:01:22.710> before<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.340> spawn<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> which<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
block before you spawn it which is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
block before you spawn it which is
really<00:01:24.570> cool<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.900> map<00:01:25.080> makers<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:26.009> another

health<00:01:42.240> bar<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.659> well<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.170> hovers<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.829> above

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
health bar as well as hovers it above

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.469 
health bar as well as hovers it above
them<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.579> very<00:01:44.640> hard<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> name

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
them it's very hard to see the name

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.850 
them it's very hard to see the name
above<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> Enderdragon<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> have

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
above the Enderdragon because you have

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
above the Enderdragon because you have
to<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.280> close<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.210> him

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to get really close to see it with him

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.149 
to get really close to see it with him
but<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> wither<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.530> easy<00:01:49.710> too<00:01:49.950> as

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
but the wither it's pretty easy too as

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.090 
but the wither it's pretty easy too as
you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.170> pretty<00:01:52.530> awesome

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you can see so that is pretty awesome

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.899 
you can see so that is pretty awesome
now<00:01:53.700> another<00:01:54.149> thing<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.570> name<00:01:54.840> tags<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:56.579> one

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
now another thing with name tags the one

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
now another thing with name tags the one
of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> bugs<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.479> fixed<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> lot<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
of the bugs they fixed is that a lot of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
of the bugs they fixed is that a lot of
the<00:01:58.530> name<00:01:58.680> tags<00:01:58.950> were<00:01:59.189> too<00:01:59.399> high<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.939> too<00:01:59.969> low

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the name tags were too high or too low

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.300 
the name tags were too high or too low
so<00:02:01.020> they're<00:02:01.290> now<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> little<00:02:02.070> bit<00:02:02.250> more

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so they're now a little bit more

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
so they're now a little bit more
centered<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> lot<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> mobs<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.020> spider

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
centered on a lot of the mobs the spider

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.170 
centered on a lot of the mobs the spider
one<00:02:04.560> seems<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.070> faded<00:02:05.490> still<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.060> some

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
one seems to be faded still for some

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.359 
one seems to be faded still for some
reason<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.350> silverfish<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.129> pretty

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
reason but the silverfish one is pretty

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
reason but the silverfish one is pretty
good<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.729> used<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.030> very<00:02:09.060> high<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.989> saw

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
good it used to be very high if you saw

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.199
