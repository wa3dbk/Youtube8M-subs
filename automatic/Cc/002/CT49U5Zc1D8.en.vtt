00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
93 or something like that for the idea

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
93 or something like that for the idea
of<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.550> gun<00:05:24.980> so<00:05:25.980> he's<00:05:26.130> pretty<00:05:26.400> cool<00:05:26.520> I'll<00:05:27.060> take

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
of the gun so he's pretty cool I'll take

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.820 
of the gun so he's pretty cool I'll take
off<00:05:27.480> the<00:05:27.690> gun<00:05:28.760> so<00:05:29.760> yeah<00:05:30.419> he's<00:05:30.630> got<00:05:30.840> poseable

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
off the gun so yeah he's got poseable

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.270 
off the gun so yeah he's got poseable
legs<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:34.710> paint<00:05:34.919> does<00:05:35.070> not<00:05:35.250> come<00:05:35.430> off

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.659 

he's<00:05:38.730> got<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.360> Eevee<00:05:39.930> a<00:05:40.220> shoulder<00:05:41.220> pad<00:05:41.400> right

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
he's got the Eevee a shoulder pad right

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.220 
he's got the Eevee a shoulder pad right
there<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.240> couldn't<00:05:42.690> figure<00:05:43.020> out<00:05:43.140> a

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
there and that I couldn't figure out a

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.770 
there and that I couldn't figure out a
way<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.410> make<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.740> grenade<00:05:44.040> her<00:05:44.190> shoulder<00:05:44.460> pad

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
way to make the grenade her shoulder pad

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.050 
way to make the grenade her shoulder pad
then<00:05:45.780> I<00:05:46.140> don't<00:05:46.440> really<00:05:46.500> go<00:05:46.800> into<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.430> hassle

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
then I don't really go into the hassle

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.210 
then I don't really go into the hassle
of<00:05:48.210> making<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:49.640> collar<00:05:50.640> Grenadier<00:05:51.390> a<00:05:52.350> chest

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
of making the collar Grenadier a chest

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.590 
of making the collar Grenadier a chest
armor<00:05:53.550> with<00:05:53.700> the<00:05:53.850> shield<00:05:54.090> on<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.419> side

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
armor with the shield on the side

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.580 
armor with the shield on the side
because<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.900> thought<00:05:55.050> that<00:05:55.110> would<00:05:55.290> just<00:05:55.440> be<00:05:55.560> too

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
because I thought that would just be too

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.840 
because I thought that would just be too
hard<00:05:55.950> he<00:05:56.100> wouldn't<00:05:56.340> be<00:05:56.400> able<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:56.610> turn<00:05:56.729> his

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
hard he wouldn't be able to turn his

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.380 
hard he wouldn't be able to turn his
head<00:05:57.110> so<00:05:58.110> I<00:05:58.140> just<00:05:58.410> attached<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.240> sleeping<00:06:00.240> bag

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
head so I just attached the sleeping bag

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.630 
head so I just attached the sleeping bag
of<00:06:00.570> a<00:06:00.660> backpack<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.080> there<00:06:01.500> painted<00:06:02.310> over<00:06:02.430> it

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
of a backpack on there painted over it

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.800 
of a backpack on there painted over it
and<00:06:02.820> kind<00:06:02.970> of<00:06:03.030> made<00:06:03.180> it<00:06:03.270> look<00:06:03.390> like<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.600> was

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
and kind of made it look like it was

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.260 
and kind of made it look like it was
weathered<00:06:04.200> a<00:06:04.350> little<00:06:04.590> bit<00:06:04.710> and<00:06:05.550> he's<00:06:05.729> got<00:06:06.240> a

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
weathered a little bit and he's got a

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.550 
weathered a little bit and he's got a
backpack<00:06:06.540> on<00:06:06.870> his<00:06:07.020> back<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:09.169> then<00:06:10.169> he's<00:06:10.350> got

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
backpack on his back and then he's got

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.770 
backpack on his back and then he's got
the<00:06:10.950> like<00:06:11.340> some<00:06:11.640> binocular<00:06:12.180> things<00:06:12.450> glued

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
the like some binocular things glued

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.670 
the like some binocular things glued
onto<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.169> top<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:15.150> there's<00:06:15.479> George<00:06:15.870> I'm<00:06:16.410> gonna

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
onto the top so there's George I'm gonna

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.900 
onto the top so there's George I'm gonna
I<00:06:16.800> think<00:06:17.010> I'm<00:06:17.220> going<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.460> paint<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.729> visor

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
I think I'm going to paint the visor

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.810 
I think I'm going to paint the visor
like<00:06:18.210> a<00:06:18.240> reddish<00:06:18.630> orange<00:06:19.220> so<00:06:20.220> he<00:06:20.400> looks<00:06:20.610> more

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
like a reddish orange so he looks more

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.460
