working out with your horse over and
over<00:01:40.380> again<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.159> sets<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
over again you can do this in sets of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.569 
over again you can do this in sets of
five<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.119> seven<00:01:42.450> repetitions<00:01:42.990> correct

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
five to seven repetitions correct

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.789 
five to seven repetitions correct
repetitions<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.790> correct<00:01:45.540> repetition<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.170> when

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
repetitions a correct repetition is when

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
repetitions a correct repetition is when
I<00:01:46.979> tap<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> horse<00:01:47.579> he<00:01:48.210> gives<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.659> inside

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I tap the horse he gives me that inside

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.810 
I tap the horse he gives me that inside
leg<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.500> moves<00:01:49.710> forward<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.460> some<00:01:50.670> energy

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
leg and moves forward with some energy

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.310 
leg and moves forward with some energy
okay<00:01:51.649> now<00:01:52.649> let's<00:01:53.250> say<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> horse<00:01:53.729> gives<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
okay now let's say the horse gives you

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
okay now let's say the horse gives you
some<00:01:55.320> sort<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> wrong<00:01:55.829> response<00:01:56.280> say<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> goes

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
some sort of wrong response say it goes

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.520 
some sort of wrong response say it goes
backwards<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.899> start<00:01:58.140> tapping<00:01:58.439> them

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
backwards when you start tapping them

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.800 
backwards when you start tapping them
you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.549> immediately<00:01:59.909> add<00:02:00.090> pressure<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you can immediately add pressure to the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.380 
you can immediately add pressure to the
halter<00:02:01.110> ask<00:02:02.040> horse<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> stop<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> initiate

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
halter ask horse to stop and initiate

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.139 
halter ask horse to stop and initiate
that<00:02:03.509> cue<00:02:03.750> again<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.979> not<00:02:05.189> want<00:02:05.969> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
that cue again you do not want to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.999 
that cue again you do not want to
continue<00:02:06.689> tapping<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.500> horse<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.890> he's
