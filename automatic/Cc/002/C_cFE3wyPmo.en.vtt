I'm<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.050> running<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> aluminum<00:00:38.489> links

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I'm just running all the aluminum links

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.209 
I'm just running all the aluminum links
aluminum<00:00:39.629> bottom<00:00:40.050> links<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> rear

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
aluminum bottom links here in the rear

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
aluminum bottom links here in the rear
and<00:00:41.489> aluminum<00:00:41.850> top<00:00:42.059> four<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.300> lengths<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and aluminum top four at lengths all the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
and aluminum top four at lengths all the
way<00:00:43.020> around<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> wide<00:00:43.710> joint<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.399> as

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
way around and the wide joint up here as

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
way around and the wide joint up here as
well<00:00:44.930> everything<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.140> aluminum<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.710> way

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
well everything is all aluminum that way

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
well everything is all aluminum that way
that's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.340> must-have<00:00:47.670> there's<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> other

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that's a must-have there's all the other

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
that's a must-have there's all the other
ones<00:00:48.840> flex<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> stuff<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.039> doesn't<00:00:50.550> work

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
ones flex and stuff so it doesn't work

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
ones flex and stuff so it doesn't work
very<00:00:50.879> good<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.210> every<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:51.870> plastic<00:00:52.379> flex

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
very good when every all plastic flex

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.880 
very good when every all plastic flex
but<00:00:52.860> also<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.239> front<00:00:55.280> front<00:00:56.280> aluminum

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
but also I have the front front aluminum

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.369 
but also I have the front front aluminum
steering<00:00:59.510> steering<00:01:00.510> drag<00:01:00.809> link<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
steering steering drag link up at the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.609 
steering steering drag link up at the
front<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.080> approves<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
front as well and that just approves a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.080 
front as well and that just approves a
lot<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.949> steering<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.489> stuff<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.060> just

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
lot on steering and stuff and it's just

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.219 
lot on steering and stuff and it's just
more<00:01:06.600> responsive<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.290> less<00:01:07.860> flex<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.960> can

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
more responsive and less flex and it can

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.899 
more responsive and less flex and it can
handle<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.830> aluminum<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
handle the aluminum because it is a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
handle the aluminum because it is a
metal<00:01:12.210> gear<00:01:12.360> servo<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.020> won't<00:01:13.200> strip<00:01:13.470> out

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
metal gear servo so it won't strip out

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
metal gear servo so it won't strip out
but<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.939> thing<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> plastic<00:01:15.750> ones<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but the thing with the plastic ones is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
but the thing with the plastic ones is
that<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.439> flex<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.189> act<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that they actually flex and act as a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.910 
that they actually flex and act as a
servo<00:01:18.330> saver<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.110> kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.500> bad<00:01:19.680> thing

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
servo saver so it's kind of a bad thing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.240 
servo saver so it's kind of a bad thing
and<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.460> good<00:01:20.610> thing<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> same<00:01:21.210> time<00:01:21.509> but

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
and a good thing at the same time but

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.380 
and a good thing at the same time but
running<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> stock<00:01:23.580> shocks<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.210> think

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
running the stock shocks I don't think

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.609 
running the stock shocks I don't think
there's<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.780> need<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> upgrade<00:01:25.259> them

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
there's really a need to upgrade them

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:25.969 
there's really a need to upgrade them
yet

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
yet

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219 
yet
I<00:01:26.009> mean<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.210> my<00:01:27.360> buddy<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> proline

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I mean like my buddy got the proline

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.560 
I mean like my buddy got the proline
shocks<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.130> they're<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.060> much<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> an

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
shocks and they're not much of an

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330 
shocks and they're not much of an
upgrade<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.530> might<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.220> keep

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
upgrade so I might as well just keep

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
upgrade so I might as well just keep
these<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:34.020> those<00:01:34.170> but

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
these on here I was gonna get those but

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.050 
these on here I was gonna get those but
now<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> decided<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> waste<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.670> money<00:01:35.909> on

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
now I decided not to waste that money on

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.469 
now I decided not to waste that money on

here and I just figured out mount those
on<00:02:39.850> there<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.150> pretty<00:02:40.300> easy<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.750> drill

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
on there it's pretty easy you just drill

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.400 
on there it's pretty easy you just drill
holes<00:02:41.290> through<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.620> bottom<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.280> then<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
holes through the bottom and then you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.540 
holes through the bottom and then you
put<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.500> through<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:44.950> put<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> little<00:02:45.280> bolt

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
put it through it and put a little bolt

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.920 
put it through it and put a little bolt
on<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.820> other<00:02:45.880> side<00:02:46.209> as<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.570> can<00:02:46.600> see<00:02:46.840> up

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
on the other side as you can see up

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.030 
on the other side as you can see up
there<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.290> that's<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.530> same<00:02:47.709> thing<00:02:47.890> with

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
there and that's the same thing with

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.949 
there and that's the same thing with
this<00:02:48.190> side<00:02:48.430> there's<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.790> bolt<00:02:49.000> inside<00:02:49.390> there<00:02:49.630> so

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
this side there's a bolt inside there so

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.690 
this side there's a bolt inside there so
it's<00:02:50.290> pretty<00:02:50.410> easy<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.860> plastic<00:02:51.280> nuts<00:02:51.520> and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700
