00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.769
 Hi, I'm gustavo arriaga colÃ­n sy 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.459
 total pinte solutions.com in this 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.370
 opportunity I have a video about the 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.410
 workforce 845 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.060
 I can tell you that this model is a 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.100
 American model is a printer 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:30.230
 American who has come to our country 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:34.840
 replacing the 15 and 20 or 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.580
 high work models that 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.830
 unfortunately exo is not withdrawing the 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.270
 market then many importers 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.280
 we are purchasing these printers them 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 we are bringing and we are adapting the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.610
 Continuous ink system to the equipment 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.480
 So what are the benefits of this 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.149
 printer well 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.930
 among other things because it has a panel 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.000
 touch where you can do all the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.440
 movements that you want all the panels 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.730
 It is tactile 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.730
 is everything in English if that can be a 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.130
 disadvantage but anyway 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.320
 at the office level that where more 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.810
 they use workforce machines because that 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.690
 it's extremely friendly we can see the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.570
 levels of ink where then the chip 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.100
 it works perfectly well it fulfills its 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.080
 work among other benefits as well as 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.000
 we can see here above tells us that 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.970
 can stand van paper trays of 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.759
 up to 500 sheets because it has double 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.190
 double tray has here a tray and 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.770
 have another tray here then you can 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.440
 put on a full paper ruler and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.820
 forget about paper 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.480
 and obviously he has the tray of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.090
 efe that will help us to be able to take 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.770
 automatic copies you place the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.720
 document up face up 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.090
 and proceeds to enter the scanner 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.709
 wireless 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.260
 As you can, you can notice we have 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.489
 here 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.489
 the scheme 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.850
 basically a sect 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.270
 of basically network configuration 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.420
 settings then you place it 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.490
 in network through the router and the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.090
 machine is automatically configured 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.770
 to seem used 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.590
 a wifi 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.300
 what else do we have good here this machine 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.070
 is already adapted to the continuous system 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.310
 this system continues us what 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.350
 let's tell ourselves 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.910
 the elite system 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:07.710
 If you already have your system adapted 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.810
 It is a fast machine is a machine 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.209
 extremely fast 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.209
 has its applications for offices 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:23.620
 for business and an additional indication 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:28.510
 at the height that causes the two trays 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:32.319
 of paper allow me to install the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:37.680
 tanks that are for 300 milliliters of 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:41.430
 ink or also the tanks that are 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.200
 and half liters of ink is to say that at 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.379
 just like you can forget about putting 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.719
 paper because you're going to put the paper 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.180
 nobody can forget me and fill in paper 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:55.859
 the ink tanks since we can 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.609
 install the continuous medium system 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.080
 liter of each color without any 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.980
 problem can you 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.450
 quote 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.390
 the epson workforce 845 printer in the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.440
 cone print well be with the elite system 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.910
 or with half-liter tanks or 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.930
 300 milliliters half a liter of ink 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.000
 yields approximately 5 thousand sheets per 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.070
 each color then you will not have to 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.310
 Fill 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.020
 the ink for a long time and you're not going to 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.010
 get your hands dirty 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.870
