00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.569
 service people here is your noble people 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'll show you a blatant ball 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.080
 freistoss tutor become nacken ball 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.790
 meat gives its 14 with the new 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.500
 Engine works in my opinion 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.619
 Great our western rules two 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.480
 to bring free kicks is recommended 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 you therefore a player with at least 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.890
 80 shot power of a good meat that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.810
 sons best not even over 80 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.269
 Ronaldo will probably be many of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.920
 but papers like he has 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.350
 noticing that he's not that consistent 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.210
 because many of him can shoot 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.110
 very far over the gate if you are with his 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.969
 and his process engineering shoots in 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.980
 Naked Ball Free Kick Use Run 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.590
 l1 and circle while pressing the left 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.020
 Stick in a legal right upper right 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.329
 the corner at the left friesland left 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.960
 up in the corner and picks up like it is in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 video looks more than more than the red one 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.640
 beams to power best 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.930
 about half the best distance for 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.150
 a shot may take up to 25-30 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.680
 even 40 meters has already there 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.540
 not affected because I am very 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 convinced that on a permanent basis 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.780
 should work 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.760
 fight back then show a picture then 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 could see it even better if here 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.780
 a few examples before running in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.720
 Paderborn are quite good others are 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.220
 not so good and later at the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 I challenge you to skate challenge 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.610
 show message that a bit too 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.670
 illustrate and you also see that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.200
 if you do not go to the red bar 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.030
 can pretty much miss it or 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.579
 in other words, the wall simply makes the ball 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.630
 Full in the wall on we are whole 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.880
 good example 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.409
 more than half of the red bar 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.729
 still fully made almost to the end 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.159
 in vain up into the corner to aim 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.659
 yes best of all new feeling i give you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.579
 no exact point for the ball 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.009
 flying always different the ball has no 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.840
 specifically line the ball is as I said 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.399
 a flatterball fly that time 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.110
 there and best I would with 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.450
 legal goods start this as an angle 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 my po just always a bit behind 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 on the left, the ball mostly moves 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.729
 flies out on the right 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.929
 we do not have skaters again where 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.130
 I'll give you that a little bit better 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.380
 Show that this is really one 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.730
 plate when this is not just because 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:21.680
 say you can see that here in the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.569
 camera attitude much better said the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.160
 reste distance are 30 meters again 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.510
 here and then you can see fluttering 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.910
 a little bit is not that right now 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.480
 crass but there are already decent 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.640
 Wrestlers then move a lot 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.070
 bring with them and very very difficult 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.940
 hold and for me the best player 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.709
 I think for such a case shock artist 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.420
 arango von monchengladbach at easy 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.730
 some wrong precision has me 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.350
 wish firepower and easy 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.790
 actually makes those fine 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.519
 we wanted to include only 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.489
 rudimentary right target and the 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.780
 right power means if a few more 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.880
 go through examples 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.739
 who, for example, is not that good by far 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.720
 to the right where you have achieved so far 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.500
 most say they go something 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.030
 continue to the right 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.070
 at a right-wing minister so oblique 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.470
 An is usually running a left foot then 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.250
 Of course, logically missing 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.130
 to the left 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.480
 so put the best start-up I find is 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.239
 as with arango nhl for example honda 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.900
 just normal start relatively straight 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.180
 to the ball 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.470
 because with the oblique it can often 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.049
 that's just how it happens 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.870
 completely to the right, we just breast 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.820
 not exactly estrogen 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.540
 So that was it for today first one 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.670
 maybe another two 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.590
 generated tutorials and how paper 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.590
 central because the new never could
