00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
some proof and evidence compiled that uh

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.140 
some proof and evidence compiled that uh
you<00:01:07.830> would<00:01:07.950> probably<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.939> here

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you would probably like to see so here

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
you would probably like to see so here
it<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> perhaps<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.010> earliest

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it is so this is perhaps the earliest

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.149 
it is so this is perhaps the earliest

clue dag X revealed about a new armor
update<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> refer-a-friend<00:01:15.270> system<00:01:16.110> way

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
update was the refer-a-friend system way

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.100 
update was the refer-a-friend system way
back<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.860> august<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.580> something<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
back in like august or something and the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.840 
back in like august or something and the
armor<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.740> character<00:01:20.220> appears<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.729> be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
armor this character appears to be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.990 
armor this character appears to be
wearing<00:01:21.119> appears<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> doesn't<00:01:22.680> seem<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
wearing appears like it doesn't seem to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820 
wearing appears like it doesn't seem to
resemble<00:01:24.299> any<00:01:24.630> armor<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.290> currently<00:01:25.650> in

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
resemble any armor that is currently in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.530 
resemble any armor that is currently in
the<00:01:25.950> game<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.509> during<00:01:27.950> runefest<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.729> similar

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the game and during runefest a similar

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.469 
the game and during runefest a similar
armor<00:01:30.930> appears<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.369> concept<00:01:32.880> art<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
armor appears this is the concept art of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.870 
armor appears this is the concept art of
the<00:01:33.630> graphically<00:01:34.200> updated<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.479> steel<00:01:36.479> armor<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the graphically updated a steel armor so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.819 
the graphically updated a steel armor so
this<00:01:38.880> like<00:01:39.299> looks<00:01:39.600> almost<00:01:39.810> exactly<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
this like looks almost exactly like the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
this like looks almost exactly like the
armor<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.400> shown<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> refer<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
armor that was shown in that refer a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
armor that was shown in that refer a
friend<00:01:42.540> system<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.829> pretty<00:01:44.040> strong

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
friend system so that's a pretty strong

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.850 
friend system so that's a pretty strong
up<00:01:44.600> suggestion<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.780> steel<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.470> eventually

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
up suggestion that steel will eventually

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.460 
up suggestion that steel will eventually
be<00:01:46.979> updated<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:48.659> realistic<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
be updated to look more realistic in the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
be updated to look more realistic in the
sense<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.950> what<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.460> actually<00:01:50.670> looked<00:01:51.030> like

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
sense of what it actually looked like

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
but again it looks very similar to the

but again it looks very similar to the
steel<00:03:22.620> armor<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.790> see<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:23.970> animated

character wearing it and this is just

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.580 
character wearing it and this is just

that<00:05:22.740> there<00:05:22.919> is<00:05:23.070> no<00:05:23.220> update<00:05:23.430> for<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.820> last

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
that there is no update for the last

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.940 
that there is no update for the last
week<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.240> january<00:05:24.780> from<00:05:25.110> behind<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.710> scenes

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
week of january from behind the scenes

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.190 
week of january from behind the scenes
which<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:26.820> theoretically<00:05:27.540> when<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:27.870> dragon

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
which is theoretically when the dragon

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.360 
which is theoretically when the dragon
armor<00:05:28.410> update<00:05:28.710> was<00:05:28.830> supposed<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.160> take<00:05:29.340> place

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
armor update was supposed to take place

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.610 
armor update was supposed to take place
before<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:30.030> was<00:05:30.090> pushed<00:05:30.389> back<00:05:30.630> but<00:05:31.229> he<00:05:31.380> or<00:05:31.440> she

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
before it was pushed back but he or she

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.040 
before it was pushed back but he or she
says<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.580> troll<00:05:32.820> wars<00:05:33.090> own<00:05:33.330> content<00:05:33.810> and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
says that the troll wars own content and

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.380 
says that the troll wars own content and
a<00:05:34.169> berth<00:05:34.620> rope<00:05:34.950> graphical<00:05:35.729> update<00:05:36.000> i<00:05:36.030> think<00:05:36.300> it

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
a berth rope graphical update i think it

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.730 
a berth rope graphical update i think it
is<00:05:36.510> is<00:05:36.720> what's<00:05:36.960> going<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.110> be<00:05:37.229> released<00:05:37.500> next

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
is is what's going to be released next

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.200 
is is what's going to be released next
so<00:05:38.400> that<00:05:38.520> leads<00:05:38.669> me<00:05:38.789> to<00:05:38.970> believe<00:05:39.000> that

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
so that leads me to believe that

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.779 
so that leads me to believe that
possibly<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.470> second<00:05:40.950> week<00:05:41.100> of<00:05:41.280> februari

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
possibly the second week of februari

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.230 
possibly the second week of februari
might<00:05:42.090> be<00:05:42.240> when<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:43.550> dragon<00:05:44.550> armor<00:05:44.760> update<00:05:45.060> is

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
might be when the dragon armor update is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.020 
might be when the dragon armor update is
but<00:05:45.479> please<00:05:45.810> don't<00:05:46.560> quote<00:05:47.130> me<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.580> like
