00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.740
 how can 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.280
 carpet fit cook 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 there is 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:25.390
 irregularly shaped with knots and notches and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 impose fallen initially 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.779
 was going to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.809
 from each head you neither cola and cut 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.899
 then transfer there found more simple 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.899
 the way 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.320
 at first 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.499
 dealt with which parties will be harder 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.190
 and harder this side is left here 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.239
 overlapping 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.420
 March, the essence was guess later 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.420
 by centimeter can be corrected then 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:05.170
 There we begin with the fact that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.620
 apply and look for corners or you place 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.860
 trial and 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:14.470
 1 and the second prop from us there without the way 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.070
 it was like a puncture tire 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.070
 We will fix this place too, and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 find this point find this point 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 celebrate 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:42.910
 and we are looking for the next one as well; 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.960
 yourself a place for a landmark in animals here 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:52.840
 this place we will continue straight 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.520
 delineated and we can cut you need 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.600
 7 but you can 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:06.750
 With a sharp knife that even services push 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.080
 partly on anything we fit and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.080
 we cut along the line 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.650
 I get this point then this point 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.650
 then we get these two 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:27.700
 this point further we leave directly 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:32.130
 1 . straight 2. right on 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.980
 for they also apply the ruler 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.000
 mark a straight line cut off go 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.140
 further in the corners and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.140
 and later we can have all the grandmas already twirled 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:52.350
 the rest of the good work done in 15 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.350
 minutes
