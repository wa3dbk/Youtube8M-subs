00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello everyone followed by football tricks 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.190
 online I'll show the following 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.190
 trick 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.150
 plus 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 Y 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.100
 As you can see, the trick is very good 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.109
 visually the truth that it seems that it is 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.730
 something complex but very easy to them 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.140
 Let's explain step by step how 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.510
 perform this trick so they can 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.379
 do it in any type of football 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.670
 before continuing, I'll leave you a 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.199
 small square here to the left where 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.399
 you will be able to click and watch a video 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.809
 tutorial that we have in our channel 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.579
 I'll also leave the link in the 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.140
 description this video tutorial is a 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.030
 very similar trick we're going to do today 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.379
 and if you practice it, you can provide 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.820
 steps of today so click on the 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.280
 cuadradito if you want to see this tutorial 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.530
 but the truth is that it is not 100% necessary 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.369
 to be able to learn from today's trick what 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.440
 what are we going to do for this trick what 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.000
 next we throw the ball for the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.250
 dominant oven to then step on the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.149
 with the sole of the foot not dominant what 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.440
 let's do now that we're going to 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.360
 crush so that the ball is 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.740
 forward of the dominant foot where is my 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.590
 hand now then we have to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.840
 drag there more or less then 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.610
 when the drag we have to step on 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.830
 with the dominant forward of the ball 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.780
 so that the ball passes behind the 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.320
 new mirante ok then all together 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.570
 It would be like that we drag 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.909
 we look forward and before he leaves very 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.470
 away we bend over and knees 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.630
 we press the ball with the knee the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.729
 dominant obviously a very thing 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.290
 important the initial position of the ball 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 as you can see it is in line with the foot 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.479
 dominant is neither too far ahead nor too 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.610
 back is in line to later roll 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.770
 the diagonal way so that it is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.900
 forward of the dominant foot then that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.009
 It would be ideal so you can not 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.119
 it has to be perfect it can be a 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 little further a little more 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.660
 back as you master the trick you 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.270
 go out in different ways but 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.200
 mainly in line with the pp ' and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.600
 dominant to get you out 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.070
 correctly summarizing step 1 to 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.560
 continue with step 2 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.730
 ok we do everything from step 1 once 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.739
 that we have her hooked with the knee 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 then step 2 is simply 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.939
 get up 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.069
 and with the internal part of the dominant foot 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.989
 drag the ball back in what 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.250
 domina tico is making her stick it 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.500
 forward to surprise the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.969
 opponent so that they see it a little better 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.260
 let's do step 1 and step 2 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.260
 attachments that would be something like that 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.900
 a very important advice when you roll 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.120
 the ball to then hook it with 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.290
 the knee in this way that 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.450
 displacement has to be of a 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.160
 slow way just so that this 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.600
 it's time to kneel and 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.670
 hook the ball because if you do 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.090
 a little bit faster it's just going to 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.129
 pass this 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.290
 ok you're going to want to hook the ball 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.060
 will continue long so that step of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.099
 a very slow way to have that 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.140
 control and a good chat with the knee 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.819
 the trick works in the following way 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.220
 against an opponent the first thing that 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.750
 we do step 1 hook the ball 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.400
 with the knee and at this moment 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.870
 the opponent is saying but what 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.430
 is doing this hooking the ball 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.870
 in the knee then what less to 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.150
 to wait is for us to get up and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.440
 quickly act towards that side 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.120
 then we quickly pick it up 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.860
 we have the ball on that side and when 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.810
 he reacts we do not go to the other and there 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.400
 is when the opponent believes it and we 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.930
 let 's go of the opponent a very thing 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.700
 important and it does not just happen with 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.349
 this trick but with any trick what 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.610
 it happens that I do not say it in all 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.200
 videos because they are very repetitive but 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.390
 It is very important and keep in mind for 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.650
 all the tricks that you do ok if the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.700
 opponent is very fast you have to 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.959
 perform the quick trick because 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.430
 He will react immediately and he will 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.349
 train removes the ball but if 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.379
 can see very slow wait until 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.730
 see until you see that the opponent 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.319
 reacts and stretches the leg and just 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.090
 there you change the direction of the ball 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.680
 but if he does not stretch his leg you have to 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.629
 expect issues then that's a 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.549
 precision against the opponent that you have 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.900
 have to take into account the reaction of 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.090
 opponent so that the trick comes out more 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.940
 effective then what happens to a lot 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.910
 people 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.990
 but what happens does it already is does not play 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.970
 from the trick you have to be 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.320
 watching how the opponent reacts 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.320
 so that this trick becomes effective 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.690
 they are books 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.100
 amaury 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.140
 the guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.000
 today's tutorial practice what 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.140
 train hard to do the best not 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.520
 forget to give it to me like that there is no 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.830
 heap any doubt that
