can't<00:01:48.650> do<00:01:48.799> it<00:01:48.950> now<00:01:49.220> give<00:01:49.370> it<00:01:49.400> an<00:01:49.520> angle<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.900> it's

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
can't do it now give it an angle so it's

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.870 
can't do it now give it an angle so it's
all<00:01:51.170> about<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.470> wrong<00:01:51.740> type<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.159> tension<00:01:52.670> on

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
all about the wrong type of tension on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.830 
all about the wrong type of tension on
these<00:01:53.090> cables<00:01:53.240> yeah<00:01:54.140> that's<00:01:54.409> cool<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.979> guys

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
these cables yeah that's cool you guys

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.020 
these cables yeah that's cool you guys
have<00:01:56.840> some<00:01:57.110> new<00:01:57.380> stuff<00:01:57.979> here<00:01:58.460> let's<00:01:58.820> take<00:01:59.000> a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
have some new stuff here let's take a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.490 
have some new stuff here let's take a
look<00:01:59.180> at<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.300> all<00:01:59.630> right<00:02:00.670> we<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.790> an<00:02:01.940> XLR<00:02:02.500> ID

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
look at that all right we have an XLR ID

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.590 
look at that all right we have an XLR ID
tag<00:02:03.920> cable<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.759> what<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:05.180> means<00:02:05.390> is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
tag cable and what this means is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.480 
tag cable and what this means is
normally<00:02:06.259> when<00:02:06.800> you're<00:02:06.920> plugging<00:02:07.100> into<00:02:07.369> a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
normally when you're plugging into a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.249 
normally when you're plugging into a
snake<00:02:07.759> or<00:02:07.970> box<00:02:08.179> like<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.720> have<00:02:08.810> one<00:02:09.050> two

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
snake or box like this you have one two

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.100 
snake or box like this you have one two
three<00:02:09.289> four<00:02:09.830> five<00:02:10.039> six<00:02:10.310> seven<00:02:10.520> eight<00:02:10.729> nine

three four five six seven eight nine
times<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.350> ten<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.800> guy<00:02:12.980> comes<00:02:13.220> around<00:02:13.340> with

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
times out of ten a guy comes around with

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.640 
times out of ten a guy comes around with
a<00:02:13.580> marker<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.569> piece<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.750> tape<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.200> you're

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
a marker and a piece of tape and you're

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650 
a marker and a piece of tape and you're
you<00:02:16.010> know<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.190> put<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.760> guitar<00:02:17.120> number<00:02:17.480> one

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
you know you put a guitar number one

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.630 
you know you put a guitar number one
number<00:02:17.810> three<00:02:18.080> number<00:02:18.230> two<00:02:18.470> instead<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.400> doing

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
number three number two instead of doing

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.900 
number three number two instead of doing
that<00:02:19.670> what<00:02:20.000> we've<00:02:20.150> done<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.630> made<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.989> so<00:02:21.910> by

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
that what we've done is we made it so by

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.509 
that what we've done is we made it so by
simply<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:24.140> little<00:02:24.380> dial<00:02:24.650> right<00:02:24.739> here<00:02:25.070> by

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
simply the little dial right here by

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.180 
simply the little dial right here by
simply<00:02:25.910> turning<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.950> turning

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
simply turning this and then turning

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.920 
simply turning this and then turning
this<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.760> desired<00:02:29.090> number<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.630> want

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
this to the desired number that you want

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.080 
this to the desired number that you want
and<00:02:30.230> locking<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.040> into<00:02:31.160> place<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.640> both<00:02:31.820> ends

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
and locking it into place on both ends

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.550 
and locking it into place on both ends
you<00:02:32.300> can<00:02:32.480> now<00:02:32.570> easily<00:02:32.810> with<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> flashlight

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
you can now easily with a flashlight

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560 
you can now easily with a flashlight
trace<00:02:34.070> one<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.519> one<00:02:34.670> two<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:34.970> two<00:02:35.209> three<00:02:35.480> and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
trace one and one two and two three and

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.660 
trace one and one two and two three and
three<00:02:35.750> built-in<00:02:36.200> label<00:02:36.769> maker<00:02:36.980> exactly

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
three built-in label maker exactly

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.520 
three built-in label maker exactly
pretty<00:02:37.940> much<00:02:38.120> yeah<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.690> then<00:02:38.840> then<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.350> cool

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
pretty much yeah and then then it's cool

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.840 
pretty much yeah and then then it's cool
it's<00:02:39.650> still<00:02:39.860> embraces<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.519> sizzix

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
it's still embraces the sizzix

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.060 
it's still embraces the sizzix
technology<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.989> just<00:02:42.019> crack<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:42.800> off

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
technology so you can just crack it off

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.860 
technology so you can just crack it off
silently<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.760> seamless<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.840> think

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
silently and seamless and and I think

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.390 
silently and seamless and and I think
that's<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.230> whole<00:02:45.410> purpose<00:02:45.560> here<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:45.920> like<00:02:46.100> we

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
that's the whole purpose here is like we

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.620 
that's the whole purpose here is like we
don't<00:02:46.550> want<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:46.760> make<00:02:47.030> another<00:02:47.060> cable<00:02:47.450> we

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
don't want to just make another cable we

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.000 
don't want to just make another cable we
want<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.840> make<00:02:47.930> something<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.890> little

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
want to make something that is a little

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.070 
want to make something that is a little
bit<00:02:49.220> different<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.700> has<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.880> purpose<00:02:50.269> yeah<00:02:50.750> so

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
bit different and has a purpose yeah so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.140 
bit different and has a purpose yeah so
we<00:02:51.200> kind<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.410> took<00:02:51.560> old<00:02:51.950> technology<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:52.760> made

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
we kind of took old technology and made

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.270 
we kind of took old technology and made
a<00:02:53.180> new<00:02:53.420> yeah<00:02:53.900> that's<00:02:54.170> cool<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.590> wouldn't<00:02:54.829> you

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
a new yeah that's cool you wouldn't you

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.350 
a new yeah that's cool you wouldn't you
know<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.430> wouldn't<00:02:55.579> think<00:02:55.850> you'd<00:02:56.030> see<00:02:56.209> this

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
know you wouldn't think you'd see this

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.270 
know you wouldn't think you'd see this
in<00:02:56.510> an<00:02:56.600> XLR<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.350> mean<00:02:57.620> that's<00:02:57.680> cool<00:02:57.980> what<00:02:58.160> else

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
in an XLR I mean that's cool what else
