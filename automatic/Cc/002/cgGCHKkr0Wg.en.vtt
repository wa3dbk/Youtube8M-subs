00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.470
 good morning in this video I hope to be 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.510
 brief to show you how to install or 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.040
 how to hack the story of crank and how 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.709
 in previous videos I showed them 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.039
 now I bring you 6 as well as all where 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.549
 bring modified in this case is and good 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.549
 of the same 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 first so good to download it 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.080
 the check package 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.650
 now I'm going to take it out with you to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.650
 show them 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.750
 with ice I installed it but I'm going 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.560
 to reinstall now so that they see that yes 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.560
 that if there is no 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.969
 in the previous video if someone from the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.620
 who see it came to see this many 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.579
 they said no that you could not anymore 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.579
 it worked 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.990
 do not 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.990
 Well, well, let's handle 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.280
 as if the sources arrived at the rhythm of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.930
 jazz rhythm dotcom 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.350
 we need to add 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.350
 we put 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.000
 one installed 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.509
 the game 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.420
 now it is not pronounced in English that does not 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.290
 I say it 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.900
 we select the collective and modify 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.100
 the time and state to do it with 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.930
 your 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.520
 right now I just realized that no no 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.159
 it is necessarily sprint action for 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.840
 so that it appears equal of all of 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.830
 all ways you can do it for the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.830
 corral or by the game 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.079
 now taking advantage of that I have 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.490
 this internet I install it with you 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.490
 to be seen 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.379
 also what was right now that 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.120
 how good it is when you install it 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.480
 same game gives you to the ducks you 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.269
 gives as 400 ducks as with 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.609
 the list of crank and it will charge as a hundred 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.829
 and so many so the greeting to teach 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.230
 how to reset the game so that they are 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:38.900
 zero ducks and yourselves can us 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.900
 go achieving what it is in the end 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.049
 ah 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.120
 yes 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.620
 I have 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.299
 this is the last update I finish 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.579
 to update just a moment ago 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.480
 to show you that you can still in the 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.480
 newest update 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.640
 now it continues so that there are no failures of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.960
 that could not be 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.790
 anything 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.170
 to something else I forgot the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.440
 description of but it will show us 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.440
 as 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.350
 on arrival good the name of flu 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.890
 and to add to any people who 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.890
 I can not see 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.640
 good as you can see I have 462 ducks 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.830
 and you're ready to play 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.420
 this is to reset the game and that 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.420
 beat or for all we will pay 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.980
 and here they tell us what order to press the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.980
 Steps 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.609
 That 's right 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.609
 and ready to reset the game 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.190
 to start playing rest of the ranking and 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.880
 where is my water 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.880
 level 0 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.160
 two 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.480
 and now yes to download all the steps 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.480
 since it is 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.470
 the game 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.970
 I'm doing this to show you that 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.790
 if it works because there are suddenly people 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.740
 which says what 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:30.400
 that I did not do well like that and now like 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.370
 I comment for him to do it 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.840
 no such thing of what 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.960
 It is proven that it works 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.470
 correctly 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.860
 nothing special for me either 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.670
 here another detail this here can not 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.400
 do neither left nor right side 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.590
 you can see there is nothing because they are 0 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.280
 ducks you have to start playing this 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.010
 to give you the story 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.060
 I'm going to play the first level so that 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.110
 can automatically play him 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.110
 in the history of the quiet 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.759
 real 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.420

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.090
 I was calm 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.870
 concepts 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.870
