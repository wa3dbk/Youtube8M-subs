00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.190
 tac channel boys, so here we are 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.170
 welcome back another video that I think 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.830
 most of the people who are 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.650
 watching they waited for what i'm 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.270
 speaking 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.309
 don't mind the cable but we have the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.860
 cell phone unloaded today so 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 we have to get hold of it 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 attacked if not during this review 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.470
 we will see off then you see this goes 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.339
 the video of today the background with a 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.309
 parallax effect like on ios 7 now not 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.269
 I know if the camera does this well 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.620
 idea 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.900
 however this application is called 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.310
 panoramic screen allows us to have 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:13.400
 a screen that moves like on ios 7 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.400
 we are going to see the application 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:25.219
 calmly calmly here is the v 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:28.049
 go widescreen we go to open 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.289
 so let's look at the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.130
 settings here we have a preview 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:39.060
 also this one moves and here they are then 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.009
 two general and advanced sub-menus 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.920
 here full-screen preview sorry 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.109
 you see it moves here every time 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 we turn the page and so on we go for 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.020
 which to approve with a general one 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.429
 different background indeed image of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.380
 background there are those already implemented 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.539
 or we can go see the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.240
 recent ones have been applied 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:08.119
 lately or with the gallery button 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.619
 we will go to our gallery to see 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.470
 some images we want for us 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.630
 example let's take a dive stefania 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.540
 wallpaper to dissolve an effect 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.170
 very nice that comes for example with 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.690
 this image here is an image of 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.480
 space here is the Pope of space you can 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.769
 set the various ones 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.959
 crop tours and if so we can 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.780
 call them the general image 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.319
 landscape portrait or costumes 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.879
 I wear costumes as I please 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.430
 because it takes all the picture not 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:47.650
 losing the definition 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.459
 let's go and select it and let's go 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.890
 to see why a preview you see 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:58.540
 in space I really like it we will go to 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:04.629
 see it for a moment, you see a lot 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.730
 very nice and tells me this effect e 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.269
 I like it alot 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.629
 however many first seen then seen 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.230
 overview then 3 view skills if 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.780
 no it will not move the image and we have 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.650
 the reflective mode high down which 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:32.160
 not much is noticed with this image 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.160
 but if I put this kind of one 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.069
 let's see how reflective way 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.069
 top down 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:50.440
 ok it's not really ok anyway ok water 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.250
 sorry but let's see with this other one 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.490
 that I had before as we can see 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.209
 up here there is another penalty if there 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.910
 was a spec 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.860
 in reality it is not present as here 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.600
 below we have both this and this 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.670
 because it reflects exactly as I said 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.520
 way it's field of view I've put 60 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.890
 degrees is what you will find at the beginning 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.820
 but you can put try we don't know 90 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:23.050
 see how it changes there 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:28.570
 we have a view in which we see more 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:32.260
 and sincerely 60 degrees here I believe it 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.620
 perfect let's use sensors if you come 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:40.360
 already debilitated they will be background to normal 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.490
 distorts the dynamics then we approach 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.250
 to the camera if active distortions 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.530
 look see how you lose the 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.000
 linearity of the background and how it becomes 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.700
 the more blurred the less defined I leave 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.880
 always disabled and this is the i 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.479
 general then we go to the advanced where 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:06.340
 we have battery usage here myself 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:09.130
 I leave 0.003 percent however I don't know the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.340
 maximum and 3 percent but I never have 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.030
 noticed a sliding difference I have 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.560
 put smart but you can 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:25.990
 systematically disabled we try a 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:28.690
 disabled ie it is deactivated a 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.030
 as I see, however, I would leave the autom 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.400
 and then number of screens where we can 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.160
 set how many screens we have in the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.550
 our home page to make it more 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.150
 fluid and then two contacts but not us 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.070
 interested so go to the play store 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.979
 the app is waiting for you like 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.720
 install it as simple as the home 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.690
 activate it to hold in short 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.790
 go to choose background go on backgrounds 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.500
 animated 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.940
 choose up to widescreen from 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.570
 here you can go directly to 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:05.230
 settings or set the wallpaper 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.320
 and here it is as you see me already 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.610
 prepared to upgrade to android 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.290
 4.4 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:17.890
 I take this opportunity to take a look 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.360
 system updates check now though 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.740
 we don't have anything yet 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.370
 I'm ready for the update 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.110
 prepared I returned to mine 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.190
 in short it is the thunder homescreens that 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.010
 without new launcher as I had before 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.330
 all customized to make me 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.090
 find it ready for when it will arrive 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:41.260
 the update I'm really curious about 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.180
 see how it will upgrade 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.250
 all those news 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.620
 I saw some site where he explains it 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:51.130
 vain but I am actually curious about 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.380
 try it with hand on my nexus so 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.970
 this is the application this is the 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.420
 video as you see it work that the 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.170
 lockscreen for which tech channel is here 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.800
 all 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.800
 Hi guys
