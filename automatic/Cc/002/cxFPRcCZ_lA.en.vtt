00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.000
 all right 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.290
 hello girls and helm before and we are here 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.820
 in the review of another motorcycle after 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.950
 I'm sure you'll love it 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.780
 personally I like it a lot and what 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.120
 does is add new animals on 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.340
 all good marine fauna only adds wildlife 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.640
 marine and some more things and forgiveness dove 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.030
 is added on the beaches there are cannibals 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.550
 ok and there's also add this this 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.050
 mineral that is the coral with which 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.620
 we can create this fantastic 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.620
 armor 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.640
 handsome let's see how much protect we are going to 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.320
 change normal 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.300
 so I think that more or less 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.090
 protect like an iron is not 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.640
 exaggerated protection but good for 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.350
 be material that neither asks us 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.659
 ask for a lot to catch is not bad we go to 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.000
 return to our recurring mode of 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:12.540
 teach everything that brings having layers 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.610
 good diving snorkel 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.920
 and they do this to see if I get 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.660
 studying the buttons and this is what 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.250
 they do is how we lose protection 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.740
 achieved but what they give us is vision 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.120
 underwater as it will not take away the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.610
 creative to activate we hope 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.530
 you have to believe me we do not drown 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.790
 while we wear these glasses and also 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.750
 we have night vision 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.720
 night vision breathing so 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.240
 It is very cool noel calamari mountain 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.970
 adds vegetation that does and adds 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.620
 minnows little badly done but not nothing 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.470
 plus 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.930
 also adds good crabs so far 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.710
 normal and if there is scandal like these are 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.049
 to see 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.049
 does not do anything like that means you do and 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.619
 that makes out without outside with 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.619
 trust 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:12.379
 this is what he adds as well as more than 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.120
 importance what affects the 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.819
 playability now let's really see 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.490
 what we need to know and those 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.180
 things 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.240
 to gas the glasses we can also make 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.100
 weapons and that but men do not 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.170
 especially 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.210
 it was not special this is to catch the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.670
 fish and that know how to take weight to 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.670
 try it the only thing I've done has been 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.550
 put it the poor foster 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.610
 I do not know if I can command will not be for 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.900
 eat it that's worth 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.340
 this does not do anything with a braking and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.380
 now we are going to how important are the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.430
 animals the truth is that it bothers me 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.430
 little that they have not put us 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.680
 from him 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.410
 from there I think it starts to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.410
 watch 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.680
 the enemies that are the cannibals 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.680
 they were done I was on the beach 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.069
 and that's it 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.019
 missing something for the manta ray is worth 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.819
 eriste leaves his voice if I leave the best 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.790
 for the end the cannibals because we 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.709
 will attack and that but not a game then 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.370
 something to keep in mind is an enemy 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.480
 more rooms can kill us if we have to 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.530
 be clumsy to normal after 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.599
 also to see what is this a yes cool no 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.200
 I know what it is to love an openly 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.489
 Water 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.930
 I am a pro the open ones if this the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.049
 most frequent things that we can see in 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.489
 the amount asia for and we can touch the 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.939
 that kill them what happens that I do not think that 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:57.319
 we believe that they do not give us anything if the 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:58.959
 kill a version if it gives you one 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.079
 he wants more he goes he does not want more to 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.090
 crabs or little crabs then 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.760
 the three swords 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.210
 sometimes it's good because the little fish 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.210
 how hassan of not having 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.690
 marine turtle is worth regret 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.690
 poor earth 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.610
 I want to save your life you want to go 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.400
 to the water we go to the water water 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.560
 do not want what happens is that I think that 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.300
 is always in the water or can 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.770
 come out I do not know that I'm a little bit to see if 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.770
 here on earth I think it 's water 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:47.290
 let's see let's see a little good 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.360
 let's not seem to die to Juan de 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.640
 Died of test blows let's go a little 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.680
 more over there to not fill the area 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.140
 wild animals 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.660
 this is a stingray you already know 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.820
 distant relative of sharks 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.620
 and can attack us between the water 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.410
 clearly but you are not to these 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.700
 heights are animals that can be 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.550
 dangerous but they do not know the whale 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.260
 find you this may be the curious one of 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.120
 if they made me think very much I would like 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.020
 make an aquarium and put this bug by 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.330
 example then we also have the orca 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.240
 it is more or less the same what happens is that 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.270
 I think it 's more dangerous about it 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.350
 with us said 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.930
 and good as you see everything is overpopulated 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.530
 we'll see that I think it has generated all 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:42.040
 animals except except the 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.210
 that I care about having many vice 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.950
 Good question, you did not take it 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.720
 pressure the context because my name is 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.140
 shark because I love sharks 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.140
 and same state to add to this and something 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.860
 of wildlife and I have not found this adds 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:00.610
 sharks so let's expose it not 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.180
 is that they are made very far there are more 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.850
 well shark the hammer and that but not 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.070
 I know I like it a lot and like a big fan 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.620
 of the sharks as as my own 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.630
 clinical name you can 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.810
 and good 96 well here we have the 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.810
 sharks 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:21.680
 Well that's all I just wanted to bring 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.680
 because it can not miss is called shark 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.760
 to be here this yes they are dangerous and 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.760
 you pass near them the same thing you get 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.850
 kill one of the floors 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.420
 but they are quite dangerous 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.480
 with minecraft characters and good 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.480
 let's let us 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.880
 out outside out outside 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.490
 as already done so that you can see a little 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.750
 colors and about how there will be there and 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.750
 it really is tourism 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.800
 and good 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.590
