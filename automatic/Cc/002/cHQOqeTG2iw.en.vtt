00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.930 
cages even if one one's at times it will
exceed<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.580> there's<00:01:53.729> gonna<00:01:53.880> be

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
exceed that and so if there's gonna be

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.760 
exceed that and so if there's gonna be
any<00:01:54.000> risk<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.899> through<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> water<00:01:55.440> shout

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
any risk just through the water shout

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.060 
any risk just through the water shout
and<00:01:55.979> give<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.250> dragon<00:01:56.700> regular<00:01:57.119> soaking<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
and give your dragon regular soaking and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:15.930 
and give your dragon regular soaking and
moisture<00:01:59.070> filled<00:01:59.250> vegetables

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.339 

so<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.360> can<00:02:17.450> see<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> fairly

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
so as you can see this is a fairly

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.559 
so as you can see this is a fairly
simple<00:02:18.709> setup<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.610> have<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.790> core<00:02:20.120> elements

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
simple setup we have the core elements

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.920 
simple setup we have the core elements
down

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
down

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.660 
down
we<00:02:21.019> need<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.319> fasting<00:02:21.769> spots<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.280> infirm<00:02:22.550> to

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
we need the fasting spots and infirm to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.640 
we need the fasting spots and infirm to
climb<00:02:22.879> on<00:02:23.060> these<00:02:23.450> proper<00:02:23.750> water<00:02:23.989> dishes<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
climb on these proper water dishes and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.710 
climb on these proper water dishes and
he<00:02:25.010> has<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.129> solid<00:02:25.519> cool<00:02:25.760> end<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.300> warm<00:02:26.569> and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
he has a solid cool end and a warm and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
he has a solid cool end and a warm and
it<00:02:27.140> also<00:02:27.260> has<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> place<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.920> he<00:02:28.040> can<00:02:28.160> hide

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
it also has a place that he can hide

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.729 
it also has a place that he can hide
under<00:02:28.670> here<00:02:29.060> another<00:02:29.840> option<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.560> could

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
under here another option that you could

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.440 
under here another option that you could
do<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.459> take<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:34.280> case<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.790> put<00:02:34.819> it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
do is to take this the case and put it

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.199 
do is to take this the case and put it
on<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.720> end<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.099> more<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.670> bulky

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
on that end that is more of a bulky

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.259 
on that end that is more of a bulky
style<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.709> dragon<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.160> insecure<00:02:40.519> then

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
style if the dragon is insecure then

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.089 
style if the dragon is insecure then
forget<00:02:41.690> about<00:02:41.720> style<00:02:42.230> just<00:02:42.590> give<00:02:42.799> it<00:02:42.920> more

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
forget about style just give it more

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.869 
forget about style just give it more
places<00:02:43.459> for<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.640> type

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.489 

and<00:02:48.030> obviously<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:48.989> are<00:02:49.109> so<00:02:49.349> many

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:49.499 
and obviously there are so many

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.140 
and obviously there are so many
different<00:02:49.890> things<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.129> you<00:02:50.219> can<00:02:50.340> do<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.999> can

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
different things that you can do you can

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.209 
different things that you can do you can
get<00:02:51.239> pieces<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.659> Grapevine<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.680> had<00:02:52.889> you<00:02:53.069> can

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219 
get pieces of Grapevine and had you can

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.190 
get pieces of Grapevine and had you can
you<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.700> vertical<00:02:54.269> climbing<00:02:54.540> space<00:02:54.900> or

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
you know of vertical climbing space or

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.709 
you know of vertical climbing space or
you<00:02:56.069> know<00:02:56.159> just<00:02:56.430> make<00:02:56.939> your<00:02:57.090> own<00:02:57.180> background

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
you know just make your own background

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.379 
you know just make your own background
make<00:02:57.930> your<00:02:58.079> own<00:02:58.139> ledges<00:02:58.680> there<00:02:59.189> are<00:02:59.400> magnetic

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
make your own ledges there are magnetic

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.300 
make your own ledges there are magnetic
warm<00:03:01.079> dishes<00:03:01.469> that<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.799> stick<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.249> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
warm dishes that you can stick on to the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.670 
warm dishes that you can stick on to the
side<00:03:02.579> tons<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.329> different<00:03:03.420> ways<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.170> build<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
side tons of different ways to build a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.190 
side tons of different ways to build a
set<00:03:04.829> up<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.909> these<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.689> basics<00:03:07.049> right

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
set up but these are the basics right

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.750 
set up but these are the basics right
now<00:03:07.409> a<00:03:07.560> pair<00:03:07.829> dragon<00:03:08.129> will<00:03:08.219> be<00:03:08.310> extremely

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
now a pair dragon will be extremely

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.390 
now a pair dragon will be extremely
happy<00:03:09.269> in<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.659> type<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:09.989> arrangement<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.859> so

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
happy in this type of arrangement and so

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.339 
happy in this type of arrangement and so
now<00:03:11.819> let's<00:03:11.849> move<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.659> lighting<00:03:12.989> back

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
now let's move on to the lighting back

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.929 
now let's move on to the lighting back
here<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.709> just<00:03:13.769> have<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.069> mini<00:03:14.280> deep<00:03:14.549> down<00:03:14.730> with<00:03:14.909> a

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
here I just have a mini deep down with a

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.569 
here I just have a mini deep down with a
horn<00:03:15.239> watt<00:03:15.480> fasting<00:03:15.870> light<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.169> it<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:17.430> will

horn watt fasting light in it you will

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.220 
horn watt fasting light in it you will
determine<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.180> proper<00:03:18.510> wattage<00:03:18.810> basking

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
determine the proper wattage basking

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.259 
determine the proper wattage basking
light<00:03:19.379> by<00:03:19.620> where<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.069> basking<00:03:20.430> spot<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.879> in

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
light by where the basking spot is in

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.789 
light by where the basking spot is in
relation<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.900> light<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.439> what

relation to that light and what

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.339 
relation to that light and what
temperature's<00:03:23.219> you're<00:03:23.340> actually<00:03:23.760> getting

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
temperature's you're actually getting

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.050
