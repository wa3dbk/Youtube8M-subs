so<00:00:40.379> yeah<00:00:40.620> um<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> guys<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.600> that

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so yeah um just that you guys know that

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.209 
so yeah um just that you guys know that
I<00:00:42.960> started<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.350> four<00:00:43.559> mil<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> we'll<00:00:44.070> see

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I started with four mil and we'll see

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
I started with four mil and we'll see
what<00:00:44.340> i<00:00:44.370> end<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.600> I'm<00:00:45.719> guess<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.230> i

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
what i end up with but I'm guess so i

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740 
what i end up with but I'm guess so i
did<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.680> bandos<00:00:47.309> duo<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.120> without<00:00:48.390> my

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
did some bandos duo this time without my

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.319 
did some bandos duo this time without my
friends<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:50.969> better<00:00:51.090> than

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
friends and it was a lot better than

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.760 
friends and it was a lot better than
solo<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.780> i<00:00:51.989> could<00:00:52.140> last<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.530> lot<00:00:52.710> longer

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
solo because i could last a lot longer

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.250 
solo because i could last a lot longer
didn't<00:00:53.489> use<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.730> much<00:00:53.850> food<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.480> stuff<00:00:55.110> like

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
didn't use as much food and stuff like

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
didn't use as much food and stuff like
that<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.829> worked<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> lot<00:00:56.309> better<00:00:56.370> than

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that so it worked out a lot better than

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.330 
that so it worked out a lot better than
soloing<00:00:57.289> pursuing<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
soloing pursuing it for it it's not the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.779 
soloing pursuing it for it it's not the
best<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.680> but<00:01:01.680> um<00:01:01.800> yes<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.609> didn't
