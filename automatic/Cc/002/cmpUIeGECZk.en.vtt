with chris from power play hi doing
piston<00:00:19.859> doing<00:00:20.279> great<00:00:20.430> how<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> once<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.039> let

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
piston doing great how so once you let

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.189 
piston doing great how so once you let
people<00:00:23.430> know<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.840> they<00:00:25.080> don't

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
people know what you do if they don't

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.130 
people know what you do if they don't
know<00:00:25.410> art<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.820> make<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
know art so what we do is you make a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.599 
know art so what we do is you make a
simple<00:00:28.140> modular<00:00:28.800> plug<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.189> play<00:00:29.310> lighting

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
simple modular plug and play lighting

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.669 
simple modular plug and play lighting
kit<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.420> idea<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.900> route<00:00:31.289> pick<00:00:31.560> your

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
kit the idea is you route pick your

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.200 
kit the idea is you route pick your
colors<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.520> wires<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.910> plug

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
colors you're out your wires you plug

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.319 
colors you're out your wires you plug
them<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.660> you're<00:00:34.410> done<00:00:34.590> no<00:00:35.399> soldering<00:00:35.940> no

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
them in and you're done no soldering no

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.080 
them in and you're done no soldering no
engineering<00:00:36.840> none<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> rest<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
engineering none of the rest of that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
engineering none of the rest of that
we've<00:00:39.090> recently<00:00:39.390> come<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.469> micro<00:00:41.129> FX

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
we've recently come out with a micro FX

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.639 
we've recently come out with a micro FX
controller<00:00:41.820> okay<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.140> 16

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
controller okay and with that it has 16

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.709 
controller okay and with that it has 16
pre-programmed<00:00:44.280> effects<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.539> use<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
pre-programmed effects you just use a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
pre-programmed effects you just use a
little<00:00:45.780> dip<00:00:46.050> switch<00:00:46.320> select<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.829> affect<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
little dip switch select which affect to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.490 
little dip switch select which affect to
which<00:00:47.399> string<00:00:47.730> boom<00:00:48.480> you're<00:00:48.719> done<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.379> out

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
which string boom you're done you're out

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
which string boom you're done you're out
Rob<00:00:49.850> obviously<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.449> how

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
Rob obviously we have I don't know how

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
Rob obviously we have I don't know how
to<00:00:51.629> turn<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.739> obviously<00:00:53.070> could

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to turn this right but obviously could

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.340 
to turn this right but obviously could
connect<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> lights

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
connect the from what I see the lights

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
connect the from what I see the lights
into<00:00:55.739> three<00:00:56.430> different<00:00:56.579> sockets<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.360> are

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
into three different sockets now are

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
into three different sockets now are
those<00:00:57.930> controlled<00:00:58.350> independently<00:00:58.649> those<00:00:59.460> are

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
those controlled independently those are

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.400 
those controlled independently those are
controlled<00:01:00.059> independently<00:01:00.270> okay<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.170> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
controlled independently okay so you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680 
controlled independently okay so you
could<00:01:01.590> pretty<00:01:01.710> much<00:01:01.800> switch<00:01:02.219> while<00:01:02.640> say<00:01:03.420> what

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
could pretty much switch while say what

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.660 
could pretty much switch while say what
this<00:01:03.989> light<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.530> blink<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.430> light

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this light will blink the other light

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.649 
this light will blink the other light
will<00:01:05.880> blink<00:01:06.000> slower<00:01:06.420> that's<00:01:07.170> exactly<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:08.659> kit

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
will blink slower that's exactly a kit

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.380 
will blink slower that's exactly a kit
that<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.049> did<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.470> somebody<00:01:10.799> he<00:01:10.950> wanted

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
that I just did for somebody he wanted

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
that I just did for somebody he wanted
alternating<00:01:12.390> flashing<00:01:12.869> lights<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.439> his<00:01:13.650> furs

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
alternating flashing lights for his furs

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
alternating flashing lights for his furs
aircraft<00:01:14.729> oh<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.900> he<00:01:16.049> wanted<00:01:16.200> his<00:01:16.560> last

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
aircraft oh and then he wanted his last

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.580 
aircraft oh and then he wanted his last
cannons<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.700> blink<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:18.930> had<00:01:19.350> all

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
cannons to blink and we actually had all

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
cannons to blink and we actually had all
three<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.890> those<00:01:20.100> effects<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
three of those effects going on from the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
three of those effects going on from the
one<00:01:21.780> board<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.470> right<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.040> when<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
one board all right on now when you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.670 
one board all right on now when you
order<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> lighting<00:01:24.360> kit<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.170> guys<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.650> a

order a lighting kit do you guys have a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
order a lighting kit do you guys have a
service<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.640> customizes<00:01:27.330> whatever<00:01:27.780> they

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
service that customizes whatever they

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
coming out with powered basis we already

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.179 
coming out with powered basis we already
have<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> working<00:01:59.700> prototype<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.890> wasn't

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

have a working prototype it just wasn't
as<00:02:02.520> small<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.119> wanted<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.680> 40

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.059 
millimeter round or slope 50 60 all the
way<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.899> you're<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.229> able<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.649> power

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
way up you're going to be able to power

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.550 
way up you're going to be able to power
your<00:02:11.370> models<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
your models so

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.309 
your models so
it's<00:02:13.430> it's<00:02:13.760> not<00:02:13.910> trivial<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.360> drill<00:02:14.930> into<00:02:15.110> your

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
it's it's not trivial to drill into your

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.610 
it's it's not trivial to drill into your
model<00:02:15.650> but<00:02:16.599> once<00:02:17.599> you've<00:02:17.810> got<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.140> done<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
model but once you've got it done it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.040 
model but once you've got it done it
looks<00:02:19.069> pretty<00:02:19.340> awesome<00:02:19.489> right<00:02:19.910> now<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.750> what
