hi<00:00:11.110> here<00:00:11.800> is<00:00:12.100> the<00:00:13.800> mash<00:00:14.800> that's<00:00:15.280> used<00:00:15.730> for<00:00:16.030> the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
hi here is the mash that's used for the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.170 
hi here is the mash that's used for the
simple<00:00:17.830> figure<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.930> can<00:00:20.200> see<00:00:20.590> that<00:00:21.160> on<00:00:21.520> the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
simple figure you can see that on the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.320 
simple figure you can see that on the
limbs<00:00:22.540> there's<00:00:23.110> an<00:00:23.740> extra<00:00:24.250> set<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.580> vertices

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
limbs there's an extra set of vertices

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.900 
limbs there's an extra set of vertices
in<00:00:25.990> the<00:00:26.020> middle<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.680> each<00:00:26.950> limb<00:00:29.460> beyond<00:00:30.460> just

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
in the middle of each limb beyond just

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.100 
in the middle of each limb beyond just
the<00:00:31.239> simple<00:00:32.010> Pentagon<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.489> five<00:00:33.910> columns<00:00:34.690> the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
the simple Pentagon and five columns the

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.410 
the simple Pentagon and five columns the
extra<00:00:35.710> set<00:00:35.980> of<00:00:36.010> vertices<00:00:36.460> in<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.120> middle

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
extra set of vertices in the middle

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.930 
extra set of vertices in the middle
there<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.970> there<00:00:39.970> so<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:41.340> when<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.610> bones

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
there is there so that when the bones

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.980 
there is there so that when the bones
underneath<00:00:43.840> this<00:00:45.990> structure<00:00:46.990> are<00:00:47.410> used<00:00:48.990> they

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
underneath this structure are used they

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.280 
underneath this structure are used they
will<00:00:50.440> bend<00:00:50.910> instead<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:51.940> just<00:00:52.420> moving<00:00:52.840> the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
will bend instead of just moving the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.710 
will bend instead of just moving the
whole<00:00:53.470> limb<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.930> you<00:00:56.110> can<00:00:56.380> see<00:00:56.740> the<00:00:57.720> model

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
whole limb here you can see the model

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.870 
whole limb here you can see the model
again<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.860> just<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:00.790> whole<00:01:01.030> mesh<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:02.880> here

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
again the just the whole mesh and here

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.990 
again the just the whole mesh and here
are<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.239> bones<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.829> mesh<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.490> attached

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
are the bones that the mesh is attached

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.870 
are the bones that the mesh is attached
to<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.689> can<00:01:07.900> see<00:01:08.200> there<00:01:08.530> are<00:01:08.560> bones<00:01:09.189> in<00:01:09.610> each

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
to you can see there are bones in each

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.849 
to you can see there are bones in each
limb<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.640> center<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.320> root

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
limb and right in the center is the root

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.149 
limb and right in the center is the root
or<00:01:15.249> the<00:01:15.640> parent<00:01:16.299> bone<00:01:16.659> that<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.679> other<00:01:17.859> ones

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
or the parent bone that the other ones

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.169 
or the parent bone that the other ones
are<00:01:18.520> attached<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:20.219> they<00:01:21.219> are<00:01:21.399> logically

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
are attached to they are logically

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.480 
are attached to they are logically
attached<00:01:22.719> but<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.469> can<00:01:23.710> see<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:23.979> they<00:01:24.280> don't

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
attached but you can see that they don't

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.340 
attached but you can see that they don't
actually<00:01:24.759> touch<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:27.389> the<00:01:28.389> requirement<00:01:29.289> for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
actually touch it the requirement for

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.039 
actually touch it the requirement for
this<00:01:29.740> loader<00:01:30.130> is<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.119> there<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.659> a

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
this loader is just that there is a

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.719 
this loader is just that there is a
single<00:01:32.409> parent<00:01:33.130> bone<00:01:33.460> for<00:01:33.969> everything<00:01:34.539> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
single parent bone for everything and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.690 
single parent bone for everything and
here<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.939> can<00:01:37.149> see<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.960> little<00:01:38.530> face<00:01:39.009> part<00:01:39.579> of

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
here you can see the little face part of

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.989 
here you can see the little face part of
the<00:01:39.909> face<00:01:40.209> is<00:01:40.740> highlighted<00:01:41.740> at<00:01:41.920> this<00:01:42.100> point

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.879 

and<00:01:45.999> it's<00:01:46.389> just<00:01:46.600> some<00:01:46.840> circle<00:01:47.259> sitting<00:01:47.770> in

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
and it's just some circle sitting in

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.419 
and it's just some circle sitting in
front<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.579> body<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.889> will<00:01:50.889> color<00:01:51.280> the

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
front of the body and will color the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.519 
front of the body and will color the
figure<00:01:51.999> and<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.920> preview<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.789> animation<00:01:55.529> in

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:56.529 
figure and will preview the animation in

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:01.019 
figure and will preview the animation in
the<00:01:57.310> walk<00:01:58.299> animation<00:01:58.749> in<00:01:59.709> blender<00:01:59.740> all<00:02:00.670> of

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:01.029 
the walk animation in blender all of

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:05.580 
the walk animation in blender all of
this<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:01.539> far<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:01.929> in<00:02:02.439> blender<00:02:04.409> where<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
this so far is in blender where the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:17.410 
this so far is in blender where the
model<00:02:05.979> was<00:02:06.189> built

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.900 

well<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.050> parent<00:02:19.890> bone<00:02:20.280> sticking

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
well there's the parent bone sticking

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.260 
well there's the parent bone sticking
out<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.360> his<00:02:21.510> back<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.850> actually<00:02:24.060> see

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
out of his back and you can actually see

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.720 
out of his back and you can actually see
the<00:02:24.660> labels<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.560> other<00:02:25.770> bones<00:02:26.130> kind<00:02:26.640> of

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the labels for the other bones kind of

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.190 
the labels for the other bones kind of
floating<00:02:27.180> around<00:02:27.270> there<00:02:27.690> too<00:02:29.510> coming<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:30.690> here

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
floating around there too coming up here

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.710 
floating around there too coming up here
this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.800> actual<00:02:32.460> rendering<00:02:32.940> with

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
this is the actual rendering with

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.570 
this is the actual rendering with
lighting<00:02:34.410> in<00:02:34.800> blender<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:37.340> here<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
lighting in blender and then here is the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.520 
lighting in blender and then here is the
MOT<00:02:39.090> same<00:02:39.540> model<00:02:40.640> exported<00:02:41.640> into<00:02:41.970> ogre<00:02:42.840> format

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
MOT same model exported into ogre format

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
MOT same model exported into ogre format
and<00:02:43.890> imported<00:02:44.880> into<00:02:45.230> croquet<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:48.240> can

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and imported into croquet and you can

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.910 
and imported into croquet and you can
see<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.880> croquet<00:02:50.930> lighting<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.470> rather

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
see that the croquet lighting is rather

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.880 
see that the croquet lighting is rather
harsh<00:02:53.490> on<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.120> model<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.260> really<00:02:55.500> doesn't

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
harsh on this model so it really doesn't

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.880 
harsh on this model so it really doesn't
look<00:02:56.250> quite<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> same
