00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.350
 Hello 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.350
 and now 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.190
 hi guys I'm me crimson d'aix 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.110
 bringing them a new good video I know that 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.210
 you should already know this but simply 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.330
 I could not stay without talking about the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.700
 subject the thing is that they delay digimon 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.160
 adventure tree and above will not be a 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.340
 series as we all expected so is 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.390
 so much fart to shit watery well let's see 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.390
 where to start 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.600
 Well, they said they were going to 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.150
 take out the series in the spring of this 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.950
 year but now we get away with that the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.410
 They will come out until November if I do not 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.750
 wrong they had also confirmed that 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.780
 it was a series but now they say they will be 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.449
 about six hours and above they will only come out in 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.210
 Japanese cinemas or my expectations 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.360
 they went down abysmally you are pure evil 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.910
 but leaving aside this I will talk about what 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.280
 What do I think about it? 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.979
 that were ova is because it is very difficult 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.590
 compress so much content in so little 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.810
 time a great example of that is pokemon 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.850
 the origin by the way there they let me know if 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.399
 they want the review going back to the topic 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.500
 pokemon the origin that although it was not 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.840
 bad if you skipped many bits of 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.940
 story why I did not want them to be 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.100
 you hear another little thing that I saw is that it has not 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.100
 no adventure character appeared 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.320
 0 I know it's unlikely but still 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.780
 I hope that they take it out of the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.830
 canon if they already confirmed that this will be 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.929
 after 0 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.270
 but they also said it would be a new 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.909
 series and it would come out in spring so 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.219
 I do not trust at all and again go back 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.439
 to the subject of what I would like to see 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.749
 good if it's not going to be a series at least 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.149
 I want the works to be epic something 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.369
 like the villains are the seven 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.770
 great demon lords repair monde 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.229
 millenium on new millennium on chip 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.450
 millenium on or even augured moon if 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.330
 they put any of those as villains 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.580
 it would be great another thing that I would like 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.220
 is that the other digimon besides 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.650
 abalone and gaumont will reach the stage 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.629
 mega yes I would like to see and this that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.150
 I said in my past video and now I see 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.340
 impossible that I would like to see what happened 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.709
 with or bremon androme on and leo monde and 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.230
 why not also for your truck x 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.599
 and it was confirmed that appear alfa moon and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.299
 Well I do not get so excited because he thought 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.549
 that lemon is very overrated 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.680
 but that is very powerful but he 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.599
 supposes that it is not an evil digimon like 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.510
 chuchas is that he was put against a 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.269
 good lemon will be a matter of sitting and 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.010
 wait like a corrupted something else of 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.980
 the one I wanted to talk about is the controversial 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.440
 character designs as I see many 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.510
 nostalgic complaining about the designs 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.450
 that the characters have 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.459
 Times change and little children hate 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.799
 animation also do not want to put 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.769
 Drawings to the eye that tone while 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.470
 they are not one those those are already obsolete 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.720
 so to speak my point is that the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.909
 designs are not so bad as to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.909
 throw them shit for example to me in what 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.799
 personal the designs of time now joe and 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.440
 I like them more now than those of 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.870
 adventure 0 your street and if they did not change 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.709
 a lot and that in my opinion it looked better 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.190
 in adventure 0 you and mimi or mini you grew up 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.230
 well x of water you make casters but 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.299
 going back to the subject the designs are not 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.940
 bad to my point of view so I do not 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.129
 I criticize that section many ask 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.829
 that if the eggs will arrive on this side of the 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.319
 puddle and good I think that if the fans 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.569
 they get moving at the best and 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.909
 they get the doubles as it happened 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.250
 with the battle of the gods and such as 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.409
 is happening with fu cats 1 efe 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.230
 no more that yes if they put the works in the 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.389
 cinemas go to pinches see them there and not 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.060
 See them online in Mandarin Chinese 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.340
 and giving spoilers left and right 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.530
 because those little people are the ones who do 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.810
 that they no longer bend nimes today by 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.090
 my part I hope that the dubbing is good 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.920
 like the first five seasons and 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.590
 respect the original music and dialogues 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.690
 not like the poop that was digimon fusion 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.600
 where they used the gringo soundtrack 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.810
 stupid censures and changed dialogues 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.520
 Another little thing that I did not like is that 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.590
 will use the opening genting of the 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.020
 first seasons is not bad in itself 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.750
 but it's a desperate tactic for 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.270
 attract more specifically the public 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.270
 nostalgic at least they would have used the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.360
 wada cowley reflex song but good 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.970
 and to finish I will say that these new 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.370
 news disappointed me a bit but 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.310
 Well, there is nothing left to do but wait and beg 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.830
 why these works are not terrible as 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.229
 they were cross wars and hunters that to me 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.210
 point of view they were horrible good 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.090
 as I have nothing more to say 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.280
 I suppose here I cut the video by 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.380
 I've already found out 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.960
 new series of dragon ball good to 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.610
 least I have to comfort me if the 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.610
 ovas turn out to be a failure 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.270
 and good people here the video is finished if 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.460
 you have something to say or if you liked the 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.279
 video you are free to put it in the box 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.279
 of comments so I like to put 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:25.180
 comment and subscribe that's all for 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.180
 now goodbye
