00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
craft now I'm I don't know whether I'll

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.490 
craft now I'm I don't know whether I'll
be<00:00:05.910> making<00:00:06.180> regular<00:00:06.600> videos<00:00:06.960> like<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.259> but<00:00:07.470> I

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
be making regular videos like this but I

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.320 
be making regular videos like this but I
just<00:00:07.680> thought<00:00:07.799> I'd<00:00:07.950> do<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.429> because<00:00:09.090> I've

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
just thought I'd do it and because I've

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.180 
just thought I'd do it and because I've
never<00:00:09.540> caught<00:00:09.960> anyone<00:00:10.469> sort<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.769> doing<00:00:11.099> this

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
never caught anyone sort of doing this

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.379 
never caught anyone sort of doing this
before<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.670> just<00:00:11.880> thought<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.030> might<00:00:12.059> have

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
before and I just thought I might have

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.320 
before and I just thought I might have
to<00:00:12.420> do<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.790> might<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> sort<00:00:15.299> of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
to do and I might have to sort of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.429 
to do and I might have to sort of
provide<00:00:15.960> as<00:00:16.170> proof<00:00:16.970> but<00:00:17.970> basically<00:00:18.690> I've<00:00:19.380> been

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
provide as proof but basically I've been

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
provide as proof but basically I've been
following<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.160> guy<00:00:20.359> Joh<00:00:23.630> Joh<00:00:25.310> Jonas<00:00:26.310> &amp;<00:00:26.640> 6<00:00:26.939> &amp;<00:00:27.090> 6

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
following this guy Joh Joh Jonas &amp; 6 &amp; 6

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.189 
following this guy Joh Joh Jonas &amp; 6 &amp; 6
for<00:00:27.660> about<00:00:28.560> 5-10<00:00:29.340> minutes<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.199> twice

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.440 
for about 5-10 minutes now and twice
I've<00:00:31.500> seen<00:00:31.710> him<00:00:31.920> go<00:00:32.250> straight<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.329> dig

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I've seen him go straight that just dig

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
I've seen him go straight that just dig
straight<00:00:33.750> down<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.170> find<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.469> spawn<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.860> know

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
straight down and find a spawn I know

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.160 
straight down and find a spawn I know
could<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.430> coincidence<00:00:35.610> I've<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.809> installed

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
could be coincidence I've just installed

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.000 
could be coincidence I've just installed
my<00:00:37.290> x-ray<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.770> checks<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.829> but<00:00:40.829> he

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
my x-ray just checks off to see but he

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.440 
my x-ray just checks off to see but he
he<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> row<00:00:42.270> twice<00:00:42.780> he's<00:00:43.050> done<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
he two in a row twice he's done it so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.150 
he two in a row twice he's done it so
next<00:00:45.450> time<00:00:45.660> I've<00:00:45.899> taken<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.590> screenshot

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
next time I've taken like one screenshot

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.180 
next time I've taken like one screenshot
and<00:00:48.440> see<00:00:49.440> where<00:00:49.559> he's<00:00:49.680> looking<00:00:49.860> always

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and see where he's looking always

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:00.560

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
keep recording and I'll cut it out until

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.320
