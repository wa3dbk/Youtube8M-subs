00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
way which we did and ultimately get a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.319 
way which we did and ultimately get a
victory<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> made<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> lot<00:01:02.070> sweeter<00:01:02.370> what

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
victory that made it a lot sweeter what

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
victory that made it a lot sweeter what
was<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> biggest<00:01:03.780> difference<00:01:04.049> between<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
was the biggest difference between the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.050 
was the biggest difference between the
two<00:01:05.100> games<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.790> an<00:01:05.909> intensity<00:01:06.710> um<00:01:08.030> well<00:01:09.030> I

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
two games with an intensity um well I

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550 
two games with an intensity um well I
just<00:01:09.360> thought<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.810> played<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> game<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.320> not

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
just thought we played the game and not

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520 
just thought we played the game and not
the<00:01:10.710> occasion<00:01:11.930> what<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> hoping<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> pass
