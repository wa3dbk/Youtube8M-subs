00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.720
 well then suddenly through the 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.360
 social networks have been reaching me 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.370
 numerous messages mainly from 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.559
 Mexico and Latin America when 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.020
 women almost all of them young down 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.240
 of the 30 years that are making me a 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.740
 series of pretty questions 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.439
 identified are placing in that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.230
 can a biologist work that could 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.800
 dedicate how much you really earn could 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.110
 live to be a biologist and it turns out that 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.780
 after digging a little in those 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.670
 messages I realize that there is a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.309
 underlying concern that is the following 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.559
 more or less you know that I love the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.129
 biology I like it a lot but I'm not 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.800
 sure to study or finish that 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.789
 biology career will allow me 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.030
 have a decent life first thing 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.360
 I would like to tell you is that if what you 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.910
 you understand for decent life goes through 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.070
 study a career only to 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.350
 find a job 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.710
 economically satisfied I think there 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.680
 a problem explained 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.690
 neither you nor I are naive and we know that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.090
 the context that we have allowed to be 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.159
 develop our society does more 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.560
 unnecessary that you find that 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.119
 let's find a way to make money 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.909
 and buy the satisfiers that 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.819
 We need to continue 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.530
 however, I would like to propose a 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.740
 hypothesis 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.350
 money is just a means that 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.130
 it could serve you to achieve your goals 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.909
 the question I think is then what is your 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.459
 so that if you want to study or finish the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.859
 Biology career only for 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.780
 get a job and earn money 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:49.719
 it really does the same thing that you choose 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.090
 any other race they give the same 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.129
 that in this world and in this time all 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.020
 the professionals of any career 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:58.810
 from any area where you can help me 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.640
 say they have it very complicated without 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.709
 come back just look out the street 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.500
 so you can corroborate what is this 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.569
 situation before this undeniable reality or 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.390
 at least undeniable for me and for 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.450
 my perspective of choosing such or 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.900
 which career do I think should be sustained 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.079
 in other arguments for example that 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.640
 wants to be what you want to dedicate 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.550
 lifetime 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.830
 what activity is going to keep happy the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.120
 rest of your life doing it 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.630
 obviously the answer to that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.220
 question is only valid for you and that is 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.800
 just what in mind that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.320
 avalen has given once this 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.750
 come way like what are you going to dedicate 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.120
 the rest of your life would be pending 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.760
 then the extra question of how are you going to 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.100
 make money the truth is that if we take 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.400
 as a reference what happens with the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.430
 colleagues at least in Mexico 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.640
 I could not tell you that things are 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.480
 badly I would have to tell you that things 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.820
 they are really bad more than half of 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 biologists at least here in mexico not 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.470
 they work on something related to their 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.290
 conditions most of them by 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.630
 example is giving classes without activity 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.480
 praiseworthy and respectable and what you like without 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.690
 before but the reality is that it's not something 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.630
 so that what they have prepared for us 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.850
 coupled with this a biologist 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.390
 again at least in mexico is winning 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.050
 8 thousand 152 pesos monthly something like 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:37.590
 about 600 dollars is about 450 euros is 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.870
 say things and it is as it is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.720
 of work for biologists is 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.810
 daunting to say the least and use it 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.120
 as a reference to make the decision 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.440
 to study this or that career the only thing 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.750
 what he's going to do is leave you with a 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.480
 bitter taste in the mouth and a twinge of 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.269
 disappointment thankfully though you 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.550
 say otherwise you are more than a 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.760
 figure 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.950
 and you know that as a biologist when I'm in 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.410
 the biologist's career what they are going to do 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.680
 is that they are going to prepare you they are going to give 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.230
 a mind of other things that is 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.230
 trained let's say to identify 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.820
 problems to raise hypotheses 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.130
 plausible and to find ways to 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.130
 solve them to find answers from 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.080
 answers believe in training is 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.690
 biologist training if you know 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.150
 use is going to be a value 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.330
 incredibly high for you the way 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.910
 to find income from your 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.830
 decision to be a biologist is not 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.260
 unidirectional means not only 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.010
 exists 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.260
 a series of options previously 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.270
 delimited not only can you search for a 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.610
 internship at the university 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.950
 you just have to beg for a 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.290
 I work though for a little bit but 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.060
 sure in government you do not just have to 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.120
 to be eternalized in postgraduate studies to live 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.510
 of the scholarships you do not just have to give 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.270
 classes in one in a short there are other 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.880
 possibilities and those those possibilities 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.650
 they depend exclusively I do not think 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.570
 frankly that a trained professional 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.940
 in science what biologists would be like 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.520
 be unable to generate creative ways 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.250
 to earn money 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.379
 money doing what he wants because that 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.009
 is what makes money doing what it 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:26.470
 wants the important thing in the end is if you 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.629
 do you think that a professional educates in 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.550
 science can do it or not what 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.790
 matter at this moment, it 's your 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.590
 decision you probably say 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.630
 what to say what happens is that of course 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.750
 you also have many innovative ideas 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.770
 to make money doing what you like 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:49.120
 but the problem is that I do not have money 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.919
 look really money is not one of 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.979
 the main things you need 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.419
 have to chat some of your ideas 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.310
 that's a pity 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.759
 The first thing you need to have is the 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.800
 holy arterial heart eggs and firmness 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.129
 record if you do not have that situation 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.020
 forget about getting a job I do not know 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.270
 what are you going to do to live I do not know what 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.750
 kind of human being are you going to do or are you going 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.789
 where are you going to convert look I already know 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.509
 I 'm nobody to give you advice 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:22.210
 I'm just a current or future colleague 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.280
 and I do not pretend anything else 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.110
 I find all this just in case 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.480
 I could be you 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.150
 the world has changed the stories that 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.330
 you have been told where the government and 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.780
 companies created the necessary jobs 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.310
 for society is prehistorian 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.680
 those stories where a 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.050
 professional just for being 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.750
 professional had affect life are 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.870
 just those stories and nothing else 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.630
 believe if you want that I'm just a 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.790
 optimist I stay with whatever the 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.570
 life and its possibilities were endless 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.430
 for you before you and for you and just wait 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.320
 your proposal for innovation your proposal 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.630
 idea your proposal of how you will win 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.849
 the money doing what you want to do 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.219
 in the life 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:13.129
 you live as those who ultimately wish 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:16.219
 find is this idea that allows you 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:18.439
 do what you like and good like you 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:21.679
 would you like and fill yourself to advance in the 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:24.110
 process there are no limits or rather if the 

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:26.379
 there is and everyone is inside what are you going 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.379
 to do
