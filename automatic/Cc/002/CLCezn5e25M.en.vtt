electronic<00:02:13.510> parking<00:02:13.720> base<00:02:13.990> but<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.290> one's

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
electronic parking base but this one's

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.220 
electronic parking base but this one's
just<00:02:14.590> confusing<00:02:15.340> because<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.870> you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
just confusing because to put it on you

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.170 
just confusing because to put it on you
actually<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.650> push<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.790> then<00:02:18.970> to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
actually have to push it and then to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.580 
actually have to push it and then to
take<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.510> off<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.959> pull<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.200> towards

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
take it off you have to pull it towards

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.290 
take it off you have to pull it towards
you<00:02:20.709> which<00:02:20.890> somehow<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.910> seems<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.209> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
you which somehow just seems like the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.210 
you which somehow just seems like the
wrong<00:02:22.420> way<00:02:22.630> around<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.709> then<00:02:23.980> there's<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
wrong way around and then there's the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.920 
wrong way around and then there's the
fact<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.610> seems<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.940> make<00:02:25.090> endless<00:02:25.600> kind

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
fact that it seems to make endless kind

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.870 
fact that it seems to make endless kind
of<00:02:26.019> annoying<00:02:26.380> beeps<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.190> bongs<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.760> mean

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
of annoying beeps and bongs I mean

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.840 
of annoying beeps and bongs I mean
whatever<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.780> just<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:30.250> starts<00:02:30.610> doing

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
whatever you do it just it starts doing

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.150

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.900 
while I'm shut up sadly that's probably
the<00:02:38.410> only<00:02:38.440> way<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.860> Avensis<00:02:39.100> will<00:02:39.640> actually
