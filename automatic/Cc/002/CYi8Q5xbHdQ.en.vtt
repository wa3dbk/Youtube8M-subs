delay<00:00:24.140> this<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.199> actually<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.130> Jack's

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
delay this is actually one of Jack's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.740 
delay this is actually one of Jack's
mods<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:28.550> isn't<00:00:29.550> super<00:00:29.880> complicated<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
mods that isn't super complicated and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.330 
mods that isn't super complicated and
hard<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.170> explain<00:00:32.809> basically<00:00:33.980> when<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.100> was

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
hard to explain basically when I was

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.190 
hard to explain basically when I was
looking<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.760> possibly<00:00:36.180> getting<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.570> nova<00:00:36.899> delay

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
looking at possibly getting a nova delay

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.389 
looking at possibly getting a nova delay
I<00:00:37.440> asked<00:00:38.190> Jack<00:00:38.460> ice<00:00:38.809> if<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:40.860> any<00:00:41.100> way<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I asked Jack ice if there was any way to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.540 
I asked Jack ice if there was any way to
make<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> DD<00:00:42.750> xx<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:44.399> can

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
make it more like the DD xx as you can

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720 
make it more like the DD xx as you can
see<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.660> on/off<00:00:46.140> switch<00:00:46.670> as<00:00:47.670> well

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
see you have the on/off switch as well

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.619 
see you have the on/off switch as well
as<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.539> tap<00:00:49.260> tempo<00:00:49.469> switch<00:00:49.980> over<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:50.940> but

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
as the tap tempo switch over here but

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.250 
as the tap tempo switch over here but
yet<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.199> way<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.739> switch<00:00:53.190> between<00:00:54.260> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
yet the way you switch between the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.160 
yet the way you switch between the
presets<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.340> actually<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:56.989> clicking<00:00:57.989> over

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
presets is actually by clicking over

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.660 
presets is actually by clicking over
here<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.390> clicking<00:01:00.390> through<00:01:00.719> these

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
here and then clicking through these

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
here and then clicking through these
three<00:01:02.670> over<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.270> vice<00:01:03.420> versa<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.960> it's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
three over here or vice versa and it's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
three over here or vice versa and it's
really<00:01:05.129> complicated<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.909> harder<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
really complicated and harder to do so I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
really complicated and harder to do so I
asked<00:01:07.650> Jack<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.130> was<00:01:08.250> any<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> mod

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
asked Jack if there was any way to mod

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.140 
asked Jack if there was any way to mod
that<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.330> change<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.909> he<00:01:11.909> said

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that and change that up and he said

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.109 
that and change that up and he said
absolutely<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.840> he<00:01:13.049> brought<00:01:13.320> me<00:01:13.790> his<00:01:14.790> nova

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
absolutely and he brought me his nova

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.080 
absolutely and he brought me his nova
delay<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:16.470> look<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.159> play<00:01:17.580> around<00:01:17.880> with

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
delay to look at and play around with

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.899 
delay to look at and play around with
and<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.280> basically<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.610> Jack<00:01:20.880> has

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and this is it basically what Jack has

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.749 
and this is it basically what Jack has
done<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.439> taken<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:26.220> tap<00:01:26.520> tempo

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
done is he has taken this tap tempo

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.830 
done is he has taken this tap tempo
function<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> changed<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.799> being<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
function and changed it into being a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.380 
function and changed it into being a
preset<00:01:30.920> scroll<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.759> scroll<00:01:33.150> through

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
preset scroll so you can scroll through

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
preset scroll so you can scroll through
all<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.720> presets<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.890> choose<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> go

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
all your presets you can choose to go

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
all your presets you can choose to go
through<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.150> few<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> go

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
through just a few of them or to go

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.719 
through just a few of them or to go
through<00:01:37.680> all<00:01:37.860> nine<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> no<00:01:40.979> longer<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
through all nine so no longer is this a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.660 
through all nine so no longer is this a
tap<00:01:42.060> tempo<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> tap<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.520> you're<00:01:44.520> just

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
tap tempo if you tap it you're just

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.690 
tap tempo if you tap it you're just
going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> end<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.149> changing<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.750> presets

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
going to end up changing your presets

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.789 
going to end up changing your presets
and<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.899> DD<00:01:49.229> 20<00:01:49.560> set

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and that was the way I have my DD 20 set

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
and that was the way I have my DD 20 set
up<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.390> gives<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
up and I really like that it gives you a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.499 
up and I really like that it gives you a
lot<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.979> versatility<00:01:52.979> being<00:01:53.880> able<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.210> switch

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
lot of versatility being able to switch

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.770 
lot of versatility being able to switch
and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.500> also<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:56.310> Jack<00:01:56.579> did<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:57.149> he<00:01:57.420> added

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and then also what Jack did is he added

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.469 
and then also what Jack did is he added
on<00:01:57.869> top<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.469> can't<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> but

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
on top up here can't really see it but

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.550 
on top up here can't really see it but
you<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.430> stereo<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.969> mono

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
you see you have your stereo and mono

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.390 
you see you have your stereo and mono
and<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.040> stereo<00:02:05.490> mono<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.119> out

and and stereo mono in and out
and<00:02:07.580> out<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.720> then<00:02:09.350> what<00:02:09.500> Jack<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:09.860> done<00:02:10.070> right

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
and out and then what Jack is done right

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.950 
and out and then what Jack is done right
here<00:02:10.340> as<00:02:10.820> he's<00:02:11.090> adding<00:02:11.540> an<00:02:11.690> extra<00:02:13.660> an<00:02:14.660> extra

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
here as he's adding an extra an extra

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.470 
here as he's adding an extra an extra
Jack<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.980> be<00:02:16.010> able<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.490> plug<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:16.940> an<00:02:17.150> external

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
Jack to be able to plug in an external

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.500 
Jack to be able to plug in an external
tap<00:02:17.990> tempo<00:02:18.340> which<00:02:19.340> part<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.760> my<00:02:19.910> reasoning<00:02:20.390> and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
tap tempo which part of my reasoning and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.780 
tap tempo which part of my reasoning and
wanting<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.990> do<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.350> was<00:02:21.980> because<00:02:22.280> Jack<00:02:22.610> had

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
wanting to do this was because Jack had

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.760 
wanting to do this was because Jack had
just<00:02:23.030> made<00:02:23.180> me<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:25.330> dual<00:02:26.330> tap<00:02:26.690> tempo<00:02:26.960> they

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
just made me this dual tap tempo they

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.890 
just made me this dual tap tempo they
could<00:02:27.980> control<00:02:28.400> both<00:02:29.390> delays<00:02:29.870> I'm<00:02:30.620> running<00:02:31.160> or

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
could control both delays I'm running or

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.250 
could control both delays I'm running or
also<00:02:32.900> having<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.620> ability<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:34.160> control<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
also having the ability to control it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.810 
also having the ability to control it
individually<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:36.920> without<00:02:37.220> getting<00:02:37.520> too<00:02:37.670> much

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
individually so without getting too much

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.970 
individually so without getting too much
into<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.240> today<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.870> wanted<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.590> kind<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.800> show

into that today I wanted to kind of show
you<00:02:40.040> guys<00:02:40.280> how<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.580> works<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.840> like

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
you guys how it works this is just like

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.390 
you guys how it works this is just like
an<00:02:42.080> external<00:02:42.620> tap<00:02:43.750> tap<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.110> changes<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:46.220> see

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
an external tap tap it it changes we see

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.000 
an external tap tap it it changes we see
the<00:02:46.520> BPM<00:02:46.970> changing<00:02:47.390> right<00:02:47.570> there<00:02:47.800> then<00:02:48.800> also

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
the BPM changing right there then also

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.420 
the BPM changing right there then also
if<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.340> tap<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.730> really<00:02:49.940> fast<00:02:50.210> same<00:02:50.510> thing

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
if you tap it really fast same thing

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.490 
if you tap it really fast same thing
this<00:02:52.430> indicator<00:02:52.970> still<00:02:53.300> works<00:02:53.570> but<00:02:54.050> this<00:02:54.260> knob

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
this indicator still works but this knob

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.800 
this indicator still works but this knob
the<00:02:55.220> switch<00:02:55.550> only<00:02:55.970> works<00:02:56.180> for<00:02:56.420> changing

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the switch only works for changing

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.590 
the switch only works for changing

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
tap in a tempo and have it transfer when

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.780 
tap in a tempo and have it transfer when
you<00:04:35.390> switch<00:04:35.720> presets<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.950> where<00:04:37.130> if<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.460> were<00:04:37.490> to

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
you switch presets to where if I were to

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.490 
you switch presets to where if I were to
do<00:04:37.940> something<00:04:38.150> at<00:04:38.450> 200<00:04:38.990> bpm

my<00:04:41.660> other<00:04:41.930> presets<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.950> would<00:04:43.130> automatically

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
my other presets it would automatically

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.060 
my other presets it would automatically
say<00:04:44.030> 200<00:04:44.660> bpm

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
for me I prefer to be able to save in a

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.460 
for me I prefer to be able to save in a
tempo<00:04:52.220> for<00:04:52.910> certain<00:04:53.300> songs<00:04:53.540> and<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.140> I<00:04:54.200> use

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
tempo for certain songs and and I use

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.350 
tempo for certain songs and and I use
same<00:04:55.040> delay<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.640> few<00:04:55.910> settings

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
same delay on a few settings

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.800 
same delay on a few settings
a<00:04:56.450> few<00:04:57.350> settings<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:58.520> same<00:04:58.760> delay<00:04:59.150> settings

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
a few settings the same delay settings

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.110 
a few settings the same delay settings
the<00:05:00.500> only<00:05:00.680> difference<00:05:01.070> is<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.430> bpm

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the only difference is the bpm

the only difference is the bpm
that<00:05:02.419> way<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:02.630> can<00:05:02.900> just<00:05:03.080> call<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:03.440> up<00:05:03.590> without

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
that way I can just call it up without

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.640 
that way I can just call it up without
having<00:05:04.160> to<00:05:04.250> tap<00:05:04.460> it<00:05:04.640> in<00:05:04.790> or<00:05:05.330> write<00:05:06.110> down<00:05:06.350> and

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
having to tap it in or write down and

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.210 
having to tap it in or write down and
then<00:05:06.770> dial<00:05:07.040> in<00:05:07.280> what<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:07.970> actual<00:05:08.300> BPM<00:05:09.200> is<00:05:09.410> so

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
then dial in what the actual BPM is so

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.400 
then dial in what the actual BPM is so
that's<00:05:10.400> kind<00:05:10.700> of<00:05:10.790> it<00:05:11.030> nothing<00:05:11.870> real

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
that's kind of it nothing real

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.230 
that's kind of it nothing real
complicated<00:05:12.800> like<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:13.310> said<00:05:14.500> jhv<00:05:15.500> 3<00:05:16.370> mod<00:05:16.910> on<00:05:17.210> the
