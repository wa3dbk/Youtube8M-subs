00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the reason i incorporate this is not in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.709 
the reason i incorporate this is not in
place<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.420> any<00:01:00.960> barbell<00:01:01.859> rowing<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.940> more<00:01:03.420> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
place of any barbell rowing but more so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.219 
place of any barbell rowing but more so
for<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.619> isolation<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> back<00:01:06.420> right<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
for that isolation of the back right a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.469 
for that isolation of the back right a
lot<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> times<00:01:07.979> when<00:01:08.610> i<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.880> heavy<00:01:09.150> when

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
lot of the times when i go heavy when

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.800 
lot of the times when i go heavy when
i'm<00:01:09.600> rowing<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:10.799> core<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:12.030> lower<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.540> will

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
i'm rowing my core or my lower back will

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
i'm rowing my core or my lower back will
start<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> give<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:14.060> faster<00:01:15.060> than<00:01:15.240> my

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
start to kind of give out faster than my

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.530 
start to kind of give out faster than my
upper<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> target<00:01:17.009> muscle<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
upper back or the target muscle right so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
upper back or the target muscle right so
what<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> eliminate

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
what this is going to do is eliminate

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.789 
what this is going to do is eliminate
the<00:01:20.939> use<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.420> core<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> can

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the use of the core so that you can

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.270 
the use of the core so that you can
stimulate<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.820> back<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.470> isolate<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
stimulate the back and really isolate it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.969 
stimulate the back and really isolate it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.500 
emphasize the most alright guys in this
next<00:02:22.330> variation<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.680> more<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.060> upper

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
next variation is more so for the upper

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.890 
next variation is more so for the upper
back<00:02:25.690> or<00:02:26.050> mid-back<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:27.460> lot<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> time<00:02:28.390> you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
back or mid-back a lot of the time you

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.150 
back or mid-back a lot of the time you
probably<00:02:30.180> use<00:02:31.180> face<00:02:31.600> pools<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.320> target<00:02:32.740> your

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
probably use face pools to target your

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.070 
probably use face pools to target your
upper<00:02:33.220> back<00:02:33.700> or<00:02:33.910> your<00:02:34.030> traps<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.720> your<00:02:34.840> rear

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
upper back or your traps and your rear

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.130 
upper back or your traps and your rear
delts<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.710> this<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.400> very<00:02:36.670> similar<00:02:37.090> only<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
delts and this is very similar only the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140 
delts and this is very similar only the
way<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.650> executed<00:02:39.460> is<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.970> help

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
way that it's executed is going to help

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.660 
way that it's executed is going to help
target<00:02:40.660> still<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.620> rear<00:02:41.800> delts<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:42.460> also

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
target still the rear delts but also

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.390 
target still the rear delts but also
more<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.840> mid-back<00:02:44.320> all<00:02:44.650> right<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.310> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
more of the mid-back all right and the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.520 
more of the mid-back all right and the
way<00:02:45.520> you're<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.850> do<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.210> is<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
way you're going to do this is with the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.860 
way you're going to do this is with the
high<00:02:47.740> pulley<00:02:48.160> you're<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.270> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.600> bring

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
high pulley you're just going to bring

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.690 
high pulley you're just going to bring
it<00:02:50.050> instead<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.680> bringing<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.280> your<00:02:51.430> face

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
it instead of bringing it to your face

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.990 
it instead of bringing it to your face
like<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> face<00:02:52.810> pool<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:54.100> are<00:02:54.340> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.760> bring

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
like a face pool you are going to bring

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.490 
like a face pool you are going to bring
it<00:02:55.120> towards<00:02:55.870> your<00:02:56.260> chest<00:02:56.850> alright<00:02:57.850> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
it towards your chest alright and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.530 
it towards your chest alright and
because<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.860> resistance<00:03:00.490> is<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.300> cable

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
because the resistance is on the cable

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.160 
because the resistance is on the cable
it's<00:03:01.900> going<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.260> go<00:03:02.410> directly<00:03:03.180> against<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it's going to go directly against the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.900 
it's going to go directly against the
movement<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.740> your<00:03:05.950> training<00:03:06.490> right<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
movement that your training right the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.700 
movement that your training right the
