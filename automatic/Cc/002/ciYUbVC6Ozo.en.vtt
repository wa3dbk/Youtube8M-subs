00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
backgrounds out of focus but let's try

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.619 
backgrounds out of focus but let's try
something<00:00:50.879> else<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.270> make<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.449> more

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
something else to make it more

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.389 
something else to make it more
interesting<00:00:54.350> let's<00:00:55.350> put<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> 21<00:00:56.219> millimeter

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
interesting let's put on a 21 millimeter

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.959 
interesting let's put on a 21 millimeter

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
85 millimeter end of the lens I'm

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109 
85 millimeter end of the lens I'm
selecting<00:01:09.869> F<00:01:10.020> 29<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> lot<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.820> depth<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
selecting F 29 to get a lot of depth of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.420 
selecting F 29 to get a lot of depth of
field<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.930> camera<00:01:13.229> selects<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.740> fifth<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
field the camera selects one fifth of a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090 
field the camera selects one fifth of a
second<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:16.170> need<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.890> using

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
second you need to know that using

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
second you need to know that using
extension<00:01:17.640> tubes<00:01:17.850> greatly<00:01:18.420> reduces<00:01:18.930> your

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
extension tubes greatly reduces your

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.469 
extension tubes greatly reduces your
depth<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> field<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.340> need<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.880> use<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> high

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
depth of field so you need to use a high

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
depth of field so you need to use a high
number<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.500> create<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:22.860> much<00:01:23.009> depth<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> field

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
number to create as much depth of field

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.890 
number to create as much depth of field
as<00:01:23.850> possible<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.119> looking<00:01:27.330> great<00:01:27.540> we're

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
as possible this is looking great we're

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.390 
as possible this is looking great we're
really<00:01:28.140> getting<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.799> texture<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really getting into the texture and the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
really getting into the texture and the
color<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> flowers<00:01:30.390> try<00:01:31.380> different

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
color of the flowers try different

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.420 
color of the flowers try different
angles<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:33.680> don't<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.829> stuck<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.130> one

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
angles as well don't get stuck in one

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.580 
angles as well don't get stuck in one
spot<00:01:35.729> make<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> fun

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
spot make it fun

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.130 
spot make it fun
let's<00:01:38.220> change<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> 2<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> longer<00:01:39.930> tube

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
let's change the 2 to a longer tube

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.690 
let's change the 2 to a longer tube
which<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.619> us<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.920> closer<00:01:41.220> we'll<00:01:41.610> go

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
which will get us in closer we'll go

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.690 
which will get us in closer we'll go
