00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.509
 good teammates let's start with 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.720
 the revisions and we're going to start with 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.440
 this model 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.190
 as with this joker model 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.190
 particularly is the hedgehog joker 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.190
 leave me 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.789
 I will tell you that today he left me 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.560
 left the guy at home then so 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.540
 nothing good as I tell you knife 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.490
 from the point of view of home and 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.480
 multipurpose joker model hedgehog let's go 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.700
 there 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.330
 we'll start by saying it's a knife 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.420
 Made of vanadium molybdenum steel 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:53.110
 ok and as you can see comparatively 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 with a ballpoint pen it is of dimensions 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 pretty contained 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.540
 and we will say that as for your 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.900
 construction is a knife totally 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.900
 whole 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.509
 totally theorized 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.860
 with the following characteristics as 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.659
 We have commented on making a full pen 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.110
 vanadium empty concave typical spanish 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:21.350
 and the knife comes with two grips of 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.930
 Bogota as you can see if in my opinion 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.140
 precious 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.810
 unpolished and without or is also precious 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.240
 I like them a lot I like them even more 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.850
 that the metro 1 that gave me my 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.970
 woman who gave me one in fields of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.580
 Bogota and the hunk come as very 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.470
 polished and highly varnished they come 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.110
 more natural I do not know if you can 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.130
 appreciate but I like this more 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.930
 color so aged 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.659
 well that the grinds come without 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.659
 dividers as you can see 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.179
 with two pins I do not know if it's aluminum 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.690
 I could not prove it would say 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.930
 that aluminum 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.260
 with a hole for one performs and with a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.890
 small body guarantor this in regards 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.110
 to its construction so more more at first 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.660
 line 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.250
 let's go into more features 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.150
 I will tell you that the length 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.170
 total of the knife are 165 millimeters of 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.860
 which 75 are 75 millimeter sheet 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.600
 and 90 are of mango controls for people 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.890
 with broad hands as is my case perhaps 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.490
 stay a bit right but still 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.390
 I will particularly say that he wields 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.230
 pretty well the thickness of the knife in 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.879
 question are 3 millimeters 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.400
 It's worth 3 millimeters of fashion and the width of 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.370
 shovel at its widest point is 30 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.730
 millimeters 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.739
 as for this we would have what is the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.019
 knife 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.950
 totally already reviewed in terms of their 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.000
 general characteristics 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.490
 talking about what the knife is 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.400
 if it enters into personal appreciations 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.210
 As I tell you, you see how I am left with a 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.960
 Tiny Justin , I'm going to stay very 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.370
 justito of what is the hand worth 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.720
 even so I will say because despite being very 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.540
 justito maybe mango 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.770
 this is solved with a thick enough 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.970
 good that fills the hand and the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.490
 I will particularly say that I am 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.690
 like it comes a twist very well 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.690
 polished very well profiled 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.340
 and what is the clear sheet geometry 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.260
 you think we 're talking about a 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.959
 very small knife with a width of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.959
 shovel very very big then well 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:59.350
 as I would say it is not a scalpel but still 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.300
 so the edge is very very good 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.240
 to me particularly as a knife 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.920
 I would like to defoliate 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:12.310
 so narrow as they are not accepted so so 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.680
 small leaf because you can get into 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.500
 any nook of the piece without 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.739
 need we are there giving him taking out 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.920
 ojai putting ipad another detail that I 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.050
 I like it a lot and I told you in the 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.270
 first post that I did review of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.450
 proofs about mt 1 is that if you 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.300
 you fix the shape of the tip is the typical 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.289
 tip with wii or tinder but it is not so 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.869
 acute is not so much 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.330
 the grade change is not that tight 

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:43.969
 It is not as beast as in the case 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.629
 of mt one that is much more than it is much 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:49.669
 more abrupt and this one is much softer 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.499
 and that does not mean that it has a tip 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:56.560
 true how can you observe a tip 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:58.300
 quite quite acute 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.340
 I will tell you that it is a knife that to me 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.320
 particularly when because this 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.070
 knife I work it alfonso timbaler 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.220
 I brought it home because they had been 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.740
 sent to him and the reviews then of 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.210
 I do them and when I brought them 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.220
 the truth is that pussy said that 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.740
 knife more than all the ones that I 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.510
 brought is the one that most called me the most 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.760
 the attention precisely because good what 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.040
 I see quite contained measures 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.330
 robust quite strong with a very sharp edge 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.610
 achieved and how good it seems to me very 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.460
 Suitable for all types for all kinds of 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.310
 jobs we will see in terms of tests 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.560
 more we're going or whatever that what 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.650
 go whatever is going over the knife 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.590
 that almost by construction and materials 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.900
 I'm sure it will not have any hits 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.950
 and well, tell you that also 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.210
 comes with case 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.160
 a cover that the truth you already know by 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.900
 the other videos that to me the covers 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.849
 I particularly like them more or less 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:08.639
 so that is a simple simple sleeve 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.320
 this is good leather with some things with 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.930
 some seams 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.730
 acceptable and with a riveted on the 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.730
 beginning and in the end 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.140
 and good the truth is that it is a tip 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.580
 simple but also particularly 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.020
 I like very much 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.970
 we see that they hold and on the knife 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:33.100
 we almost came it falls but let's go 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.350
 forgive and I tell you that I have not brought 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.440
 that he has not brought but let's see if he does not 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.640
 we move for example if we only take 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.970
 from the tip so you can see that 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.430
 I'm doing pressure to forgive the 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.080
 angle change but if we take it 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.120
 from the tip without 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.870
 without pressing the knife does not fall or 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.740
 be that it holds reasonably well 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.030
 and 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.080
 I particularly like it a lot 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:05.230
 I find it very cute I find it 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.870
 quite pretty fit for our 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.180
 jobs is a knife that for exits 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.740
 of a day for things then good for 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.740
 normal exits 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.509
 I see them very very valid 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.129
 thank you all to watch the video 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.559
 as always to thank the fact that 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:26.779
 that he sent us the material and we 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:28.819
 we are going to put in full already in the tests 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:31.969
 to the knife to see what it is that 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:34.569
 that we get a clear hug from everyone and 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:34.569
 until now
