analyze<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.350> tutorial<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.040> to

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
analyze in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.280 
analyze in this tutorial we're going to
be<00:00:02.429> creating<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:03.470> motion<00:00:04.470> tween<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.950> flash<00:00:05.430> and

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
be creating a motion tween and flash and

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.709 
be creating a motion tween and flash and
to<00:00:07.290> do<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:07.710> need<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.160> go<00:00:08.340> into<00:00:08.719> actual

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
to do this we need to go into actual

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.450 
to do this we need to go into actual
script<00:00:10.099> and<00:00:11.870> i'm<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.380> create<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.799> general

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
script and i'm going to create a general

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.439 
script and i'm going to create a general
shape<00:00:14.730> i<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:16.020> do<00:00:16.289> overall<00:00:17.210> making<00:00:18.210> us

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
shape i know just do overall making us

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.130 
shape i know just do overall making us
big<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.520> i<00:00:21.480> know<00:00:22.070> let's<00:00:23.070> go<00:00:23.279> to

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
big like this and i know let's go to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.740 
big like this and i know let's go to
find<00:00:25.140> 20<00:00:26.689> go<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.230> key<00:00:28.289> frame<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.750> you

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
find 20 go in so key frame like that you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.470 
find 20 go in so key frame like that you
can<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:32.000> our<00:00:33.000> frame<00:00:33.680> image<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:36.090> move

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
can see here as our frame image and move

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
can see here as our frame image and move
to<00:00:36.690> frame<00:00:36.930> 20<00:00:37.790> we're<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> move<00:00:40.790> our

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to frame 20 we're just going to move our

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.319 
to frame 20 we're just going to move our
bowl<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.340> delete<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> because

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
bowl we're going to delete that because

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.150 
bowl we're going to delete that because
that's<00:00:45.420> annoying<00:00:46.969> also<00:00:47.969> delete<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:49.160> so

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that's annoying also delete it here so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.389 
that's annoying also delete it here so
now<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:51.260> our<00:00:52.260> ball<00:00:52.739> moves<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> there

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
now we can see our ball moves to there

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.689 
now we can see our ball moves to there
but<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> make<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.910> move<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.250> hold<00:00:56.520> down

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
but to make it move we go hold down

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.250 
but to make it move we go hold down
shift<00:00:58.550> like<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> selects<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> there

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
shift like that so it selects it there

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.640 
shift like that so it selects it there
again<00:01:01.649> right-click<00:01:01.890> grab<00:01:02.640> motion<00:01:03.000> tween<00:01:03.650> no

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
again right-click grab motion tween no

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.539 
again right-click grab motion tween no
sorry<00:01:05.070> create<00:01:05.519> shape<00:01:05.880> between<00:01:07.130> like<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
sorry create shape between like that and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
sorry create shape between like that and
now<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> moves<00:01:10.100> look<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.170> then<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.380> we

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
now it moves look at that and then if we

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.370 
now it moves look at that and then if we
go<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.890> frame<00:01:14.689> 40<00:01:16.400> insert<00:01:17.400> keyframe<00:01:18.380> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
go into frame 40 insert keyframe and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.929 
go into frame 40 insert keyframe and
remove<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.610> make<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
remove this up here we can make it

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.649 
remove this up here we can make it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
see you can enter another keyframe and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.880 
see you can enter another keyframe and
we<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.540> move<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.350> their<00:01:36.650> into<00:01:37.650> another
