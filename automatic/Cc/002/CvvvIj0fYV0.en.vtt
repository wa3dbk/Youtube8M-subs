and<00:00:00.149> what<00:00:00.719> about<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:01.319> issue<00:00:01.439> of<00:00:01.860> sort<00:00:02.820> of

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
and what about the issue of sort of

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.460 
and what about the issue of sort of
getting<00:00:03.000> slightly<00:00:03.270> hotter<00:00:03.540> water<00:00:03.840> things

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
getting slightly hotter water things

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.670 
getting slightly hotter water things
like<00:00:04.650> showers<00:00:06.049> baths<00:00:07.049> all<00:00:07.379> those<00:00:07.500> kind<00:00:07.649> of

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
like showers baths all those kind of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.620 
like showers baths all those kind of
things<00:00:07.740> they're<00:00:08.189> looking<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:08.730> 60<00:00:09.599> degrees

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
things they're looking at 60 degrees

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.730 
things they're looking at 60 degrees
yeah<00:00:10.290> well<00:00:11.190> radiators<00:00:11.990> from<00:00:12.990> even<00:00:13.230> more<00:00:13.380> yeah

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
yeah well radiators from even more yeah

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.160 
yeah well radiators from even more yeah
I've<00:00:14.059> underfloor<00:00:15.059> operates<00:00:15.420> at<00:00:15.540> about<00:00:15.719> 35

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I've underfloor operates at about 35

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.550 
I've underfloor operates at about 35
degrees<00:00:16.470> yeah<00:00:16.770> 35<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> 40<00:00:18.320> radiators<00:00:19.320> low

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560

52<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.740> again<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.250> you're<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.550> put

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
52 right so again if you're going to put

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
52 right so again if you're going to put
in<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.970> heat<00:00:27.150> pump<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.109> can't<00:00:28.470> put<00:00:28.769> in

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
in a heat pump and you can't put in

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
in a heat pump and you can't put in
underfloor<00:00:29.400> heating<00:00:29.640> from<00:00:30.060> whatever<00:00:30.330> reason

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
underfloor heating from whatever reason

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.959 
underfloor heating from whatever reason
then<00:00:31.619> you've<00:00:31.740> got<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.130> thinking<00:00:32.309> about<00:00:32.579> low

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
then you've got to be thinking about low

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.410 
then you've got to be thinking about low

rads to get part of water you have to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.209 
rads to get part of water you have to

store water at 65 degrees by law to kill
off<00:00:44.309> Legionnaires<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:46.800> need<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
off Legionnaires you don't need to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.299 
off Legionnaires you don't need to
produce<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.059> level<00:00:48.980> just<00:00:49.980> once<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
produce it at that level just once a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.500 
produce it at that level just once a
week<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.640> need<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> keep<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.270> thin<00:00:51.570> film<00:00:51.870> with

girl<00:01:12.439> hi<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> water<00:01:13.979> temperature<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.580> lower

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
girl hi the water temperature the lower

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880 
girl hi the water temperature the lower
the<00:01:14.939> efficiency<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.320> they're<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the efficiency so that they're the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.740 
the efficiency so that they're the
advertising<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.939> marketing<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.600> guess

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
advertising and marketing which I guess

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.070 
advertising and marketing which I guess
is<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.900> you're<00:01:19.140> alluding<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:20.580> true

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
is what you're alluding to that's true

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.190 
is what you're alluding to that's true
you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.790> temperature<00:01:23.790> hot<00:01:24.180> water<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you can have temperature hot water get a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200 
you can have temperature hot water get a
nice<00:01:25.409> hot<00:01:25.619> bath<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.490> 60<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:26.909> degrees

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
nice hot bath out of it at 60 by degrees

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.499 
nice hot bath out of it at 60 by degrees
but<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.020> efficiency<00:01:28.560> will<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:28.860> down<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.400> you

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
but the efficiency will go down and you

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
but the efficiency will go down and you
can<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.869> high<00:01:31.079> efficiency<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:32.909> what

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
can have high efficiency but then what

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
can have high efficiency but then what
temperature<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.720> water<00:01:33.840> goes<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.340> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
temperature of your water goes down you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.420 
temperature of your water goes down you
can't<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:36.000> high<00:01:36.689> efficiency<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.770> high

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
can't have high efficiency and high

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
can't have high efficiency and high
temperature<00:01:38.880> water<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.299> same<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.170> do

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
temperature water at the same time so do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
temperature water at the same time so do
you<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> most<00:01:40.680> effective<00:01:41.159> solution<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you think the most effective solution to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.749 
you think the most effective solution to
that<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.200> immersion<00:01:43.590> heater

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
that is to have an immersion heater

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.710 
that is to have an immersion heater
attached<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> system<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.360> well<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.630> will

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
attached to the system as well they will

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.810 
attached to the system as well they will
just<00:01:45.869> gets<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.640> day<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
just gets it up for that one one day a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
just gets it up for that one one day a
week<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.240> needs<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.780> 65<00:01:49.229> but

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
week when it needs to be a bit 65 but

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.810 
week when it needs to be a bit 65 but
the<00:01:49.829> most<00:01:50.009> efficient<00:01:50.340> way<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.460> doing<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the most efficient way of doing it is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.560 
the most efficient way of doing it is
with<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> thermal<00:01:51.899> solar<00:01:52.290> panel

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
with it with a thermal solar panel

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
with it with a thermal solar panel
because<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:54.899> maintain<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.590> 65<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
because that will maintain it at 65 and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.010 
because that will maintain it at 65 and
you<00:01:56.399> don't<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> use<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.570> heat<00:01:57.750> pump

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you don't have to use it the heat pump

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.490 
you don't have to use it the heat pump
to<00:01:58.110> generate<00:01:58.439> any<00:01:58.649> hot<00:01:59.610> water<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.259> rely

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
to generate any hot water you can rely

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.600 
to generate any hot water you can rely
almost<00:02:01.530> entirely<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.640> on

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
almost entirely then on

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.940 
almost entirely then on
solar<00:02:04.390> panel<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.080> then<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.590> have<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.740> very

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
solar panel and then you have a very

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.070 
solar panel and then you have a very
efficient<00:02:06.430> system<00:02:06.940> which<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.600> costing<00:02:07.990> you

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
efficient system which is costing you

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.350 
efficient system which is costing you
very<00:02:08.470> little<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.009> run<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.850> which<00:02:10.000> will<00:02:10.210> meet

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
very little to run and which will meet

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.570 
very little to run and which will meet
all<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.780> comfort<00:02:11.200> issues<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.800> mean<00:02:12.490> that's

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
all the comfort issues I mean that's

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.420 
all the comfort issues I mean that's
really<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.360> ideal<00:02:13.750> solution<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.100> can't

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
really the ideal solution if you can't

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.640 
really the ideal solution if you can't
do<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.910> then<00:02:16.180> yes<00:02:16.450> an<00:02:16.630> immersion<00:02:17.080> heater<00:02:17.290> or

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
do that then yes an immersion heater or

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.430 
do that then yes an immersion heater or
an<00:02:17.740> electric<00:02:18.100> boiler<00:02:18.460> running<00:02:19.240> on<00:02:19.630> low<00:02:20.230> rate

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
an electric boiler running on low rate

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.260 
an electric boiler running on low rate
electricity<00:02:20.980> overnight<00:02:21.280> electricity<00:02:21.880> with<00:02:22.240> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
electricity overnight electricity with a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.940 
electricity overnight electricity with a
well-insulated<00:02:22.600> tank<00:02:23.320> is<00:02:24.040> your<00:02:24.310> second<00:02:24.640> best

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
well-insulated tank is your second best

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.290 
well-insulated tank is your second best
or<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.190> could<00:02:27.340> step<00:02:27.550> out<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.970> whole

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
or you could step out of that whole

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.330 
or you could step out of that whole
scenario<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.320> go<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> different<00:02:30.220> heat

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
scenario and go for a different heat

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.940 
scenario and go for a different heat
source<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.750> might<00:02:31.959> be<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.410> go<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:32.770> for

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
source it might be that you go then for

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.000 
source it might be that you go then for
a<00:02:32.980> small<00:02:33.190> wood<00:02:33.340> pellet<00:02:33.640> boiler
