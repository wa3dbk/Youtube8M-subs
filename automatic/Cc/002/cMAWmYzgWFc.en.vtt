00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.580 
gotten to the part about the people in
my<00:04:50.780> life<00:04:51.280> that<00:04:52.280> I<00:04:52.340> have<00:04:52.430> to

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
my life that I have to

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.130 
my life that I have to
deal<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:55.000> say<00:04:55.120> goodbye<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:55.990> deal

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.080 
deal with and say goodbye to and deal
with<00:04:56.290> those<00:04:56.470> emotions<00:04:56.950> so<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.460> guess<00:04:57.910> that's

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
with those emotions so I guess that's

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.730
