define<00:02:36.350> what<00:02:37.810> floor<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.170> roof<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.680> going<00:02:39.890> to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
define what floor the roof is going to

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.640 
define what floor the roof is going to
be<00:02:40.160> applied<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.790> here<00:02:41.720> we've<00:02:42.020> got<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.500> ability

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
be applied to here we've got the ability

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.610 
be applied to here we've got the ability
to<00:02:43.010> change<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.580> overhang<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.720> point<00:02:45.080> one<00:02:45.320> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
to change the overhang to point one and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.290 
to change the overhang to point one and
our<00:02:46.070> roof<00:02:46.310> pitch<00:02:46.610> which<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.510> site<00:02:47.900> or<00:02:48.080> surfaces

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.230 

so<00:02:53.990> there's<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.470> roof<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.980> finish<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:59.000> this

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
so there's a roof and finish and this

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.840 
so there's a roof and finish and this
allows<00:02:59.510> us<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.780> place<00:03:00.110> our<00:03:00.380> new<00:03:00.800> house<00:03:01.520> in

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
allows us to place our new house in

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.120 
allows us to place our new house in
either<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.570> deal<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.960> 3d<00:03:03.290> view<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:03.830> just

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
either the to deal the 3d view we just

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.340 
either the to deal the 3d view we just
drag<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.880> place<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.300> I<00:03:07.840> now<00:03:08.840> want<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.110> just

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
drag and place it I now want to just

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.980 
drag and place it I now want to just
just<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.890> views<00:03:10.390> let's<00:03:11.390> arrange<00:03:11.720> these

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
just the views let's arrange these

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.290 
just the views let's arrange these
vertically<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:14.570> zoom<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.110> show<00:03:16.040> all
