00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.760
 Yes, Kate, your dreams can be the manifestation of your emotions. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.120
 Your body and your mind thus manage 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.760
 the stress and sorrow of this tragedy. 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.640
 What if it had nothing to do with my stillborn baby? 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.760
 What would you say? 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 We must meet children this weekend. 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.320
 Maybe nightmares ... 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.120
 Maybe I'm not ready to adopt yet. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 I went past the wine merchant on my way home last night. 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 Have you come in? 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.360
 No, but I wanted to. The idea crossed my mind. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.480
 It was not for me, no. 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 I just wanted to buy a bottle, in case we had guests. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 And finally, no. 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.200
 The important thing, in my opinion, 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.800
 it's not that you've wanted to, 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.600
 but that you resisted it. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.680
 We would never have let you adopt if you were not ready. 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.320
 Finally, 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.200
 it's up to you to decide. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.680
 HAMDEN SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.240
 Hello Sweetie. 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.760
 Let me see. You painted that? 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.040 line:0%
 With the master. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.840 line:0%
 It's a beautiful butterfly. It is superb. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.120
 Really beautiful. Bravo. 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 Come on, I'm cold.
