00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hi guys it's down the money or again

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.480 
hi guys it's down the money or again
what<00:00:04.650> can<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:05.009> say<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.970> new<00:00:06.150> AMD<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.560> 350

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
what can I say about the new AMD a 350

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.169 
what can I say about the new AMD a 350
chip<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.059> piledriver<00:00:10.429> well<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:12.000> say

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
chip the piledriver well all I can say

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.770 
chip the piledriver well all I can say
is<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.200> fantastic<00:00:13.980> chip<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.540> don't<00:00:15.540> care

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
is it's a fantastic chip I don't care

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.200 
is it's a fantastic chip I don't care
what<00:00:16.020> anybody<00:00:16.320> says<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.820> very

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
what anybody says about it it's a very

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.109 
what anybody says about it it's a very
very<00:00:18.359> good<00:00:19.430> if<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.550> watch<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:21.000> videos

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
very good if you watch these videos

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.349 
very good if you watch these videos
which<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.109> all<00:00:22.199> now<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.830> will<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
which have put all now you will see the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.589 
which have put all now you will see the
difference<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> windows<00:00:25.650> index<00:00:26.160> scores

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
difference in the windows index scores

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.470 
difference in the windows index scores
it<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.840> boosts<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.920> lot<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.250> things<00:00:29.480> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it actually boosts a lot of things this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.380 
it actually boosts a lot of things this
speed<00:00:30.869> goes<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.309> memory<00:00:32.309> speed<00:00:32.610> goes<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
speed goes up memory speed goes up and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
speed goes up memory speed goes up and
the<00:00:33.960> cpu<00:00:34.590> speed<00:00:34.770> goes<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:36.660> let's<00:00:37.170> sit<00:00:38.010> back

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the cpu speed goes up so let's sit back

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
the cpu speed goes up so let's sit back
watch<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.180> video<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.050> better<00:00:40.200> be

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
watch this video because you better be

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.840 
watch this video because you better be
impressed<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:41.270> what<00:00:42.270> I've<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> show<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
impressed by what I've got to show you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
impressed by what I've got to show you
also<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> did<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> few<00:00:45.390> tests<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.989> sindhi<00:00:46.379> bench

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
also I did a few tests in sindhi bench

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.729 
also I did a few tests in sindhi bench
and<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.210> fantastically<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and it's going fantastically in that as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
and it's going fantastically in that as
well<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.460> actually<00:00:50.670> scoring<00:00:51.239> more<00:00:51.449> than<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
well it's actually scoring more than the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.330 
well it's actually scoring more than the
intel<00:00:52.829> i7<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:54.030> tests<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
intel i7 in some tests on that so I

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.670 
intel i7 in some tests on that so I
don't<00:00:57.239> worry<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> calling<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.350> chip

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
don't worry what is calling this chip

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.619 
don't worry what is calling this chip
it's<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.489> good<00:00:59.579> chip<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> price

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
it's a very good chip and for the price

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.179 
it's a very good chip and for the price
you<00:01:00.780> can't<00:01:01.350> beat<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.969> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.149> want<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> nice<00:01:04.189> not

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you can't beat it if you want a nice not

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.730 
you can't beat it if you want a nice not
a<00:01:05.220> budget<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> nice<00:01:06.119> gaming<00:01:06.659> rig<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:07.500> for

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a budget for the nice gaming rig go for

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
a budget for the nice gaming rig go for
the<00:01:07.830> AMD<00:01:08.369> chip<00:01:08.700> why<00:01:08.939> pay<00:01:09.210> more<00:01:09.240> money<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the AMD chip why pay more money for the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
the AMD chip why pay more money for the
intel<00:01:10.439> chip<00:01:10.710> when<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> aim<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
intel chip when you can get the aim to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
intel chip when you can get the aim to
Egypt<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> watch<00:01:13.560> my<00:01:13.590> other<00:01:13.799> video

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
Egypt and if you watch my other video

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.770 
Egypt and if you watch my other video
it's<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> be

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's going to what it's going to be

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
it's going to what it's going to be
better<00:01:16.040> later<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> games

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
better later on because all the games

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.469 
better later on because all the games
were<00:01:18.630> coming<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> xbox<00:01:19.790> one<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
were coming out for the xbox one and the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
were coming out for the xbox one and the
PlayStation<00:01:22.140> 4<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.040> optimized<00:01:23.549> for

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
PlayStation 4 will be optimized for

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
PlayStation 4 will be optimized for
eight<00:01:23.909> cores<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.570> obviously<00:01:25.409> they're<00:01:25.590> going

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
eight cores and obviously they're going

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
eight cores and obviously they're going
to<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.860> ported<00:01:26.310> over<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> pc<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> then

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to get ported over to the pc and then

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
to get ported over to the pc and then
your<00:01:28.259> PC's<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.040> AMD<00:01:29.250> eight<00:01:29.880> core<00:01:30.270> chip<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
your PC's got an AMD eight core chip in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.780 
your PC's got an AMD eight core chip in
it<00:01:30.840> it'll<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.860> optimized<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.579> games

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it it'll be optimized for the games

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.899 
it it'll be optimized for the games
lights<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.500> hope<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> enjoyed<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> video
