00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
shows so you got to keep that in mind he

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.569 
shows so you got to keep that in mind he
thought<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.470> more<00:02:54.680> money<00:02:54.950> he<00:02:55.190> spent

thought that the more money he spent
would<00:02:56.329> be<00:02:56.570> better<00:02:57.260> quality<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.040> that's<00:02:58.310> just

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
would be better quality and that's just

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.690 
would be better quality and that's just
not<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.820> case<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.720> keep<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.560> mind<00:03:00.709> we're

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
USB webcam it can't be any simpler

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.360 
USB webcam it can't be any simpler
install<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.299> software<00:03:14.530> take<00:03:15.530> your<00:03:15.650> USB<00:03:15.950> port

plug<00:03:16.700> into<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.090> computer<00:03:17.180> no<00:03:18.110> problems<00:03:18.650> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
plug into the computer no problems it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.600 
plug into the computer no problems it
should<00:03:19.489> just<00:03:19.640> work<00:03:20.530> for<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> larger<00:03:22.100> cameras

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
should just work for the larger cameras

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.400 
should just work for the larger cameras
the<00:03:22.820> prosumer<00:03:23.209> cameras<00:03:23.630> are<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.780> pro<00:03:23.959> cameras

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
the prosumer cameras are the pro cameras

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.080 
the prosumer cameras are the pro cameras
you've<00:03:25.040> got<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.340> have<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> little<00:03:25.670> bit<00:03:25.880> more

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
you've got to have a little bit more

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.400 
you've got to have a little bit more
hardware<00:03:28.030> these<00:03:29.030> cameras<00:03:29.510> usually<00:03:29.720> output

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
hardware these cameras usually output

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.590 
hardware these cameras usually output
HDMI<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.970> it's<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.209> standard<00:03:32.570> HDMI<00:03:33.400> port<00:03:34.600> and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
HDMI so it's a standard HDMI port and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.080 
HDMI so it's a standard HDMI port and
they<00:03:35.750> may<00:03:35.930> also<00:03:36.140> output<00:03:36.549> component<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.880> key

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
they may also output component the key

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.440 
they may also output component the key
thing<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.420> you're<00:03:39.260> going<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.440> capture<00:03:39.799> card

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
thing is you're going to capture card

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.289 
thing is you're going to capture card
this<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.660> device<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:42.549> acts<00:03:43.549> like<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.940> bridge

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
this is a device that acts like a bridge

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.870 
this is a device that acts like a bridge
between<00:03:44.329> your<00:03:45.049> camera<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.769> your<00:03:46.280> computer

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
between your camera and your computer

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.240 
between your camera and your computer
and<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.660> captures<00:03:48.230> your<00:03:48.380> video<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.040> then

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
and so it captures your video and then

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.830 
and so it captures your video and then
dumps<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.760> off<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.910> your<00:03:50.150> computer<00:03:50.690> and

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
dumps it off to your computer and

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.900 
dumps it off to your computer and
depending<00:03:51.680> on<00:03:51.829> what<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.040> capture<00:03:52.670> card

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
depending on what that capture card

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.479 
depending on what that capture card
accepts<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.900> may<00:03:54.380> accept<00:03:55.600> component<00:03:57.489> inputs

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
accepts it may accept component inputs

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.290 
accepts it may accept component inputs
it<00:03:58.760> may<00:03:59.060> accept<00:03:59.569> HDMI<00:04:00.290> inputs<00:04:00.970> depending<00:04:01.970> on

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
it may accept HDMI inputs depending on

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.150 
it may accept HDMI inputs depending on
the<00:04:02.390> capture<00:04:02.660> card<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:02.959> get

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the capture card you get

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.640 
the capture card you get
so<00:04:04.700> just<00:04:04.880> keep<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.180> in<00:04:05.240> mind<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:06.140> one<00:04:06.410> thing

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
so just keep that in mind the one thing

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.220 
so just keep that in mind the one thing
you<00:04:06.800> have<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:06.980> watch<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.550> make<00:04:07.760> sure<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:08.450> your

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
you have to watch is make sure that your

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.670 
you have to watch is make sure that your
camera<00:04:09.580> outputs<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:11.420> resolution<00:04:12.170> that<00:04:12.200> your

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
camera outputs the resolution that your

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.610 
camera outputs the resolution that your
capture<00:04:13.010> card<00:04:13.430> accepts<00:04:14.210> so<00:04:14.810> if<00:04:14.960> your<00:04:15.140> camera

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
capture card accepts so if your camera

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.600 
capture card accepts so if your camera
outputs<00:04:16.430> 1080<00:04:17.360> at<00:04:17.720> 30<00:04:18.320> P<00:04:18.650> you're<00:04:19.250> gonna<00:04:19.370> want
