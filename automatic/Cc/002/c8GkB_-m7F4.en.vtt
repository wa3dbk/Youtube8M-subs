00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.309 

so<00:00:01.319> let's<00:00:01.650> see<00:00:01.979> last<00:00:02.460> week<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:03.090> did<00:00:03.510> dumbbell

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
so let's see last week I did dumbbell

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.160 
so let's see last week I did dumbbell
curls<00:00:04.770> with<00:00:05.359> 25<00:00:06.359> pounds<00:00:07.020> so<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.900> think<00:00:09.900> this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
curls with 25 pounds so I think this

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.750 
curls with 25 pounds so I think this
week<00:00:11.450> 50<00:00:12.450> pounds<00:00:12.960> should<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:14.040> quite<00:00:14.400> alright

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
week 50 pounds should be quite alright

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.040 
week 50 pounds should be quite alright

reps<00:00:37.860> again<00:00:38.360> now<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.570> question<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
reps again now one question I

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.020 
reps again now one question I
occasionally<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.950> come<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.280> about<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
occasionally see come up about this is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.650 
occasionally see come up about this is
how<00:00:42.809> much<00:00:43.020> more<00:00:43.379> means<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.399> better<00:00:45.149> how

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
how much more means little or better how

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
how much more means little or better how
much<00:00:45.840> more<00:00:46.079> weight<00:00:46.200> should<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.039> using<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
much more weight should I be using and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740 
much more weight should I be using and
there<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> simple<00:00:49.440> rule<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.129> thumb<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:51.180> has

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
there is a simple rule of thumb that has

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380 
there is a simple rule of thumb that has
been<00:00:51.960> used<00:00:52.350> over<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.860> variety<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.520> sports<00:00:53.969> for

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
been used over a variety of sports for

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
been used over a variety of sports for
quite<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:54.899> time<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.129> apply<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
quite some time and you can apply it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.310 
quite some time and you can apply it
here<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.300> well<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.010> 10%<00:00:59.579> rule

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
here as well and that is the 10% rule

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
here as well and that is the 10% rule
the<00:01:01.320> 10%<00:01:01.739> rule<00:01:02.160> states<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.660> shouldn't

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the 10% rule states that you shouldn't

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.140 
the 10% rule states that you shouldn't
increase<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.799> difficulty<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.060> are

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
increase the difficulty of what you are

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
increase the difficulty of what you are
doing<00:01:06.450> by<00:01:06.900> more<00:01:06.930> than<00:01:07.799> 10<00:01:08.010> percent<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.670> what

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
doing by more than 10 percent of what

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.750 
doing by more than 10 percent of what
you've<00:01:09.420> been<00:01:09.689> doing<00:01:09.990> previously<00:01:10.760> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you've been doing previously in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.359 
you've been doing previously in
resistance<00:01:12.570> training<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.500> means<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
resistance training this means the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:14.960 
resistance training this means the
following

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
following

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.020 
following
if<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.780> example<00:01:15.810> last<00:01:16.770> week<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.729> did

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
if for example last week you did

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.719 
if for example last week you did
dumbbell<00:01:18.840> curls<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.439> 20<00:01:19.830> pounds<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.430> you

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
dumbbell curls with 20 pounds and you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.450 
dumbbell curls with 20 pounds and you
reached<00:01:21.030> those<00:01:21.540> 12<00:01:22.170> reps<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.920> free<00:01:23.159> sets

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
reached those 12 reps over free sets

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.999 
reached those 12 reps over free sets
with<00:01:23.970> those<00:01:24.180> 20<00:01:24.600> pounds<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> want<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
with those 20 pounds now I want to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.760 
with those 20 pounds now I want to
increase<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.759> weight<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.570> should<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.350> by

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
increase the weight you should do so by

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.240 
increase the weight you should do so by
using<00:01:29.280> two<00:01:30.000> more<00:01:30.240> pounds<00:01:30.659> because<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.829> pounds

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
using two more pounds because two pounds

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.190 
using two more pounds because two pounds
are<00:01:32.869> 10%<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.049> 20<00:01:34.979> pounds

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200 

so<00:01:41.770> this<00:01:41.950> rule<00:01:42.189> will<00:01:42.460> give<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.909> good<00:01:43.090> idea

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
so this rule will give you a good idea

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.660 
so this rule will give you a good idea
about<00:01:43.689> how<00:01:44.259> much<00:01:44.470> more<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.860> can<00:01:45.009> expect<00:01:45.460> of

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
about how much more you can expect of

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.240 
about how much more you can expect of
yourself<00:01:45.960> when<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.170> try<00:01:47.439> to<00:01:47.470> make<00:01:47.830> things<00:01:48.040> a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
yourself when you try to make things a

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.969 
yourself when you try to make things a
bit<00:01:48.430> more<00:01:48.460> difficult<00:01:48.670> for<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.840> also<00:01:50.470> help

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
bit more difficult for you and also help

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.460 
bit more difficult for you and also help
you<00:01:51.189> avoid<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.909> overtraining<00:01:52.450> issues<00:01:52.930> we

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
you avoid the overtraining issues we

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.940 
you avoid the overtraining issues we
talked<00:01:53.770> about<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:55.060> video<00:01:55.450> however<00:01:56.409> they

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
talked about in this video however they

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.999 
talked about in this video however they
also<00:01:57.100> are<00:01:57.430> two<00:01:57.700> limitations<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:58.690> rule

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
also are two limitations to this rule

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.090 
also are two limitations to this rule
the<00:02:00.009> first<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.549> when<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.659> try<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.350> increase

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
the first is when you try to increase

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.670 
the first is when you try to increase
the<00:02:03.220> weight<00:02:03.549> by<00:02:03.789> 10%<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.780> then<00:02:05.049> can't<00:02:05.409> do

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
the weight by 10% and then can't do

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.430 
the weight by 10% and then can't do
those<00:02:05.950> six<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.759> eight<00:02:06.909> reps<00:02:07.180> per<00:02:07.450> set<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:08.289> you

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
those six to eight reps per set and you

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.400 
those six to eight reps per set and you
clearly<00:02:08.739> are<00:02:09.039> using<00:02:10.000> too<00:02:10.450> much<00:02:10.660> weight<00:02:11.019> it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
clearly are using too much weight it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.650 
clearly are using too much weight it
should<00:02:11.800> instead<00:02:12.099> aim<00:02:12.459> for<00:02:12.819> an<00:02:12.970> increase<00:02:13.420> of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
should instead aim for an increase of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.309 
should instead aim for an increase of
about<00:02:14.080> 5%<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.489> second<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.660> if<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.290> are

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
about 5% in second this if you are
