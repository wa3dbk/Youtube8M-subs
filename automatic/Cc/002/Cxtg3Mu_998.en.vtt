quite a few deer that are starting to
hit<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.989> already<00:03:01.290> which<00:03:01.829> is<00:03:01.859> surprising

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
hit it already which is surprising

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.099 
hit it already which is surprising
because<00:03:02.700> usually<00:03:03.090> they<00:03:03.420> hit<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.959> the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
because usually they hit this in the

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.289 
because usually they hit this in the
later<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:04.980> winter<00:03:05.280> but<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.700> came<00:03:05.909> up<00:03:05.940> so

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
later in the winter but this came up so

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
good I think there they find it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.670 
good I think there they find it
palatable<00:03:07.889> right<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:09.450> plot<00:03:09.810> came<00:03:10.139> up<00:03:10.319> so

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
palatable right now this plot came up so

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.530 
palatable right now this plot came up so
good<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.190> am<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.760> thrilled<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.420> the
