looks<00:00:46.489> pretty<00:00:46.550> well<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.150> is<00:00:47.360> a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
looks pretty well this is a

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.799 
looks pretty well this is a
it's<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.399> really<00:00:48.700> fast<00:00:48.969> vehicle<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.660> know<00:00:49.780> I

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809

it's a really fast vehicle you know I
grew<00:00:50.170> up<00:00:50.260> around<00:00:50.550> carts<00:00:51.550> my<00:00:51.700> whole<00:00:51.879> life

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
grew up around carts my whole life

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.930 
grew up around carts my whole life
shifter<00:00:52.840> carts<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:54.520> different<00:00:54.820> with

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
shifter carts and it's different with

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.369 
shifter carts and it's different with
those<00:00:55.090> because<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.449> feel<00:00:55.690> every<00:00:55.930> bump<00:00:56.110> of<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
those because you feel every bump of the

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.960 
those because you feel every bump of the
road<00:00:56.559> for<00:00:56.770> this<00:00:56.890> thing<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.250> suspension<00:00:57.850> it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
road for this thing the suspension it's

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.400 
road for this thing the suspension it's
so<00:00:58.149> smooth<00:00:58.540> it<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:58.930> feels<00:00:59.170> like<00:00:59.290> you're

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
so smooth it just feels like you're

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.220 
so smooth it just feels like you're
floating<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.980> then<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.489> motor<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.000> fast<00:01:01.300> it's

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
floating and then the motor so fast it's

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.109 
floating and then the motor so fast it's
got<00:01:02.379> almost<00:01:02.530> 200<00:01:02.769> horsepower<00:01:03.250> all<00:01:03.970> the

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
got almost 200 horsepower all the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.060 
got almost 200 horsepower all the
electrics<00:01:04.600> everything<00:01:04.960> is<00:01:05.050> just<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.350> easy<00:01:05.619> all

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
electrics everything is just so easy all

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.510 
electrics everything is just so easy all
you<00:01:06.159> have<00:01:06.460> done<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:06.700> add<00:01:07.030> can<00:01:07.360> filter<00:01:07.750> Stewart

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you have done is add can filter Stewart

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.190 
you have done is add can filter Stewart
pretty<00:01:09.520> much<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.030> stocking<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.780> stock

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
pretty much it's a stocking and stock

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.610 
pretty much it's a stocking and stock

you<00:01:16.580> know<00:01:16.700> there's<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:16.940> big<00:01:17.180> difference<00:01:17.360> on<00:01:17.690> on

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
you know there's a big difference on on

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.680 
you know there's a big difference on on
how<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:18.980> performs<00:01:19.460> over<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.910> motorcycle<00:01:20.600> I

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
how this performs over the motorcycle I

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.540 
how this performs over the motorcycle I
mean

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
mean

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.640 
mean

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
but ask for performance wise you know

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.610 
but ask for performance wise you know
unlike<00:01:30.700> other<00:01:31.000> cars<00:01:31.510> or<00:01:31.870> full<00:01:32.080> of<00:01:32.260> vehicles

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
unlike other cars or full of vehicles

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.260 
unlike other cars or full of vehicles
you<00:01:32.800> don't<00:01:32.980> feel<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.550> acceleration<00:01:34.120> like<00:01:34.210> a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
you don't feel and acceleration like a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.850 
you don't feel and acceleration like a
motorcycle<00:01:34.570> has<00:01:34.990> where<00:01:35.260> unless<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.680> do
