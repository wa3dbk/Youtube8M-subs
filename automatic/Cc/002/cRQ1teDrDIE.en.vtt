00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello dear friends with us today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.330
 on the channel such a premiere 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.490
 knives sander Russian manufacturer 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.960
 is the capital Starominskaya 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.759
 Krasnodar region 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 the knife was given for review 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 Novosibirsk shop knives blade we 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.779
 today let's talk about the knife fish from this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.359
 maker neck not a knife to wear 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.439
 it is assumed here on such a leather 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.880
 neck strap 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.890
 he just all connected no 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.570
 There are no additional instructions at all 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 A lot of natural materials can 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.149
 say all is full land under the same 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.250
 made of leather strap and leather 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.719
 scabbard around the neck here so here they are 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.399
 look so pretty pretty 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.440
 embossed not that this is something 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.910
 I will not say the original so 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.539
 some Slavic motifs here 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 used here from the inside in general all 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.980
 it is made from one piece of leather which 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 somehow stitched with the skin 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 molded so the profile will show these so 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.610
 that's done the knife sits very firmly there 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.870
 that is, I do not like trying to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.460
 the camera doesn't just fail this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.680
 do on no matter how I tried to shake out 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 hence my knife is practically 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.769
 as if he doesn't even move on 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 millimeter essentially peace should be done very 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.240
 tight that for a neck knife it's like 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 very logical uncomfortable let's on 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.110
 see for yourself not all tth of this knife to me 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 known because the site of the brothers 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.799
 sander for some reason does not contain our fish 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.500
 but I can't find it in the camera or in it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.000
 something like this in the guys layer them and the site 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.290
 In general, there are some questions in my opinion 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 it's just not filled up at the moment 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.950
 steel on this particular instance 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.320
 used h12mf and the handle is made of 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.960
 stabilized karelian birch here 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.619
 let's look at the handle itself 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.210
 saying here so i would put it that way 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.710
 probably a variation on the Finnish knife 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.420
 that is, of course everything is not quite here 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.360
 such Athenian geometry of the blade but 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 no less she is very like him and 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.479
 the handle is made let's say so too 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.500
 like the Finns that is, I would probably 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.600
 cut out so here they are actually 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.909
 classic Russian knives and not so 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.640
 and pretty many years already are and 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.910
 it is known that they take their roots as 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.649
 times where the northern Slavs and merged 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.660
 with the Finns, let's say that somehow 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.370
 that is why 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.020
 we have with them like knives have always been 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.900
 quite a few years here in general 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.790
 as soon as possible such motives are with 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.860
 northern Slavs are used here in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.940
 this knife, too, although there is some 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.710
 moment which is so on 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.840
 we are also referred to the south with 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.090
 more detail show a good grip 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.100
 comfortable and catchy as it should be 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 Finnish knife that is all the advantages 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.350
 handles finnish knives she possesses then 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.240
 doesn't know that in general doesn't need 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.980
 Explanations who without knowing it would recommend 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.990
 just some you made me in 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 finland finnish knife knife once 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.680
 hold milk grip you are not completely 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.510
 I think you will understand what I am talking about 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.630
 comfortable and well hand grip 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.820
 fine working not us on it very much 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.830
 all is well such here so here it is 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.740
 Looks like let's gradually twist it 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.530
 so you just look better 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.360
 brass bolster made on this knife 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.860
 how does this not know what material 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.780
 beautiful insert done that is but 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.330
 as it does not know what it is exactly 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.380
 formation unfortunately there is no such 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.560
 notching on the master made from the front 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:21.120
 knife sides 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.320
 pretty nice by the way look too 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
 classic, that is, in general, in principle 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.020
 There are quite a few knives on the Russian market 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 which are made according to a similar pattern with 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.470
 single mounting apparently 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.320
 used on the back of nothing 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.820
 we do not see vodka for him 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.970
 shank can't say anything 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.650
 well actually the top of the knife here to me 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.300
 it seems fu tank may not be quite 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.160
 justified option because of course 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.480
 This knife is supposed to be used as 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.700
 2 specially left so we call yes 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.250
 so forging marks are properly called 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.920
 as far as I know about that is visible 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.540
 that the knife is not processed completely that too 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.330
 so often enough on 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.310
 Finnish knives 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.890
 modern produced exactly 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.470
 Finland in the most beautiful here so very 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.540
 aesthetically beautiful look 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.870
 Negro but honestly say about like this 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.730
 thing i'm straight so on folding knives she 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.410
 niche probably inappropriate but here with knives 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.350
 fixed blade is very nice 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.880
 looks like 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.840
 down the satin so I think that 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.580
 you can see here. 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.370
 this machining traces and guilt 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:31.010
 but basically they are satined afterwards 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:38.330
 still say well and betray here such 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:39.920
 a glitter of such processing done so 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.870
 Looks like a butt he, too, on the outside 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.480
 featured not processed but no 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.370
 here here clinging faces are not here 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.640
 butt i think about three meters 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.320
 unfortunately here guard jean we see here 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.430
 something like this is about folding 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.140
 good knives here such a thing that 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.970
 I wanted to say about the North Nastya 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.500
 this knife it seems to me that here 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.540
 still there is such a little moment 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.100
 which us well 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.780
 to some southern motives of knives refers to 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.510
 east even i would say so because 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.020
 here unlike most Finnish 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.180
 knives made here such a lift 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.680
 tip at least i finca which 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.320
 would have done so before not seeing then 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.720
 there is a tip here a little bit above the line 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.130
 cotton arm and blade, he lifted 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.070
 as if so slightly up I just 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.270
 I doubt that the camera is clearly visible 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.230
 in view of the fact that all the same our read 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.410
 a little bit but in my opinion 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.030
 it should be like this 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.410
 looks like it seems to me sending us 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.660
 some kind of Turkish linda well 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.340
 actually manufacturers 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.960
 are still there in the south of Russia there 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.229
 quite often faces themes of you 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.760
 exact geometry i.e. was such a 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.410
 there may even be accidents like that 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.210
 on my for such a curious idea I'm 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.370
 principle like knives whose tips 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.290
 slightly raised because me 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.270
 but the need to pick my personal 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.010
 rarely happens with the more mess 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.560
 knife on 1 row will speak especially 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.180
 ever need a mouth such opportunities 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.350
 have a little more cutting edge 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:06.440
 she usually makes me pretty good 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.150
 the knife from the box is sharpened by yana shaving 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.520
 great cuts paper with all sorts of there 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.940
 quilts checks for everything else 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.380
 steel h12mph as far as I know it by 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.740
 its properties if normal 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.120
 it is treated like steel d2 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.350
 accordingly but you can imagine 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.880
 present an example which workers 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.610
 characteristics in our country is steel 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.169
 quite common 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.350
 the services of the sander company it is written that they 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.120
 use blanks 1964 release 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.250
 that I don't know how it can claim 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.580
 a bunch of blanks from someone left with that 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.039
 pores well, as they say, a piece of beer 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.729
 manufacturer's site is written so in 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:45.620
 stigma is done here on the other 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.050
 hand carry no instructions on some 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.060
 other knives have the first letter 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.770
 name of steel if it is not as far as 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.130
 I know in Alexander's tone that means that 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.080
 used steel h12mf it was she 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.300
 something like this it looks like so the 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.880
 cameras decided to indulge in light 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:06.200
 so I apologize for what you see 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.300
 unfortunately almost can not actually here 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.400
 such impressions I could 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.620
 say so some serious flaws 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.240
 I did not see the designs are not very clear 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.830
 I left this lanyard well I would have him 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.360
 just took off and don't even think about anything 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.460
 Here are the rest, in principle, enough 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.710
 comfortable neck knife for those who do 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.479
 need neck knives I honestly 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.990
 I retake this video a second time because 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:31.729
 that in the previous material is very strong 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.830
 spread on the fact that i'm at all 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:35.030
 I think about wearing a knife around my neck 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.150
 In this case, I will say so if you 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:44.389
 use 94 grams of neck knives 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:46.039
 knife without scabbard and with the necessary weights 117 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:47.449
 gram I think they say more than 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:50.719
 nice weight 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:52.520
 for our type of knife 

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:54.289
 interferes with wearing tried that is better 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.509
 I sat this respect normally executed 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:59.479
 I just personally don’t really like sewing knives
