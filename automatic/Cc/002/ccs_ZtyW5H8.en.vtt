on the forest combat pants because I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.429 
on the forest combat pants because I
thought<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.630> actually<00:01:49.049> looks<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.409> of

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
thought that actually looks kind of

funny<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:50.970> change<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.360> gloves<00:01:51.630> but

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
funny and you can change the gloves but

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.170 
funny and you can change the gloves but
as<00:01:52.140> soon<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> put<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.829> any<00:01:53.100> other<00:01:53.310> shirt<00:01:53.759> it

as soon as you put on any other shirt it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
as soon as you put on any other shirt it
will<00:01:54.869> make<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> glitch<00:01:55.710> disappear<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.820> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
will make the glitch disappear but this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.429 
will make the glitch disappear but this
looks<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.540> funny<00:01:57.750> with<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> gun<00:01:58.170> because

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
looks really funny with a gun because

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.050 
looks really funny with a gun because
you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.829> straight<00:01:59.189> through<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.909> you're

definitely the outfit to go with the
second<00:02:08.280> outfit<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.700> arrow<00:02:08.940> which<00:02:09.239> was

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
second outfit it's arrow which was

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.540 
second outfit it's arrow which was
submitted<00:02:09.690> by<00:02:10.020> somebody<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.069> decided<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
submitted by somebody and I decided to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.280 
submitted by somebody and I decided to
do<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.849> now<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.870> hood

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
do this now that we have the hood

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.399 
do this now that we have the hood
in<00:02:13.349> GTA<00:02:13.769> online<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.030> isn't<00:02:15.209> exact<00:02:15.930> but

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
in GTA online and this isn't exact but

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.880 
in GTA online and this isn't exact but
it<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.680> definitely<00:02:16.920> pretty<00:02:17.549> close<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.739> we<00:02:19.739> did

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
it is definitely pretty close so we did

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.369 
it is definitely pretty close so we did
the<00:02:20.010> forest<00:02:20.459> combat<00:02:20.970> pants<00:02:21.269> because<00:02:22.049> that<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
the forest combat pants because that is

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.720 
the forest combat pants because that is
the<00:02:22.470> best<00:02:22.650> color<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.189> I<00:02:23.220> could<00:02:23.400> find<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the best color that I could find to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.520 
the best color that I could find to
match<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:25.079> know<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.349> right

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
match it and it's you know the right

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.399 
match it and it's you know the right
shape<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.159> guess<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.329> can<00:02:27.480> say<00:02:27.659> and<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
shape I guess you can say and then I

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.050 
shape I guess you can say and then I
want<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.799> do<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> green<00:02:29.250> stealth<00:02:29.579> jacket

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
want to do the green stealth jacket

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.309 
want to do the green stealth jacket
because<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.510> also<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.900> right<00:02:31.049> shape

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
because that is also the right shape

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.170 
because that is also the right shape
it's<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> little<00:02:32.220> bit<00:02:32.370> lighter<00:02:32.670> than<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.030> would

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it's a little bit lighter than I would

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.319 
it's a little bit lighter than I would
have<00:02:33.269> liked<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.720> be<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:35.340> looks<00:02:36.060> pretty

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
have liked it to be but it looks pretty

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.000 
have liked it to be but it looks pretty
close<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:37.560> obviously<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.579> forest<00:02:40.010> hood

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
close and then obviously the forest hood

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.460 
close and then obviously the forest hood
the<00:02:41.340> ski<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.909> ski<00:02:42.209> mask<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.049> hood<00:02:43.230> is

do grey but I like the charcoal a little

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.900 
do grey but I like the charcoal a little
bit<00:03:38.310> more<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.760> then<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:39.900> did<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.590> same<00:03:40.859> suit<00:03:41.639> or

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
bit more and then I did the same suit or

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.789 
bit more and then I did the same suit or
the<00:03:41.970> same<00:03:42.480> jacket<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.169> I<00:03:43.230> did<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.769> last

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
the same jacket that I did with the last

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.360 
the same jacket that I did with the last
one<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.790> grey<00:03:45.060> stealth<00:03:45.449> jacket<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.230> then<00:03:47.069> I

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
one the grey stealth jacket and then I

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.550 
one the grey stealth jacket and then I
think<00:03:47.699> that's<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.000> closest<00:03:48.389> one<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:49.530> I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
think that's the closest one so I

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.770 
think that's the closest one so I
decided<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.069> put<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:51.000> standard<00:03:51.540> body

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
decided to put on the standard body

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.750 
decided to put on the standard body
armor<00:03:52.199> but<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.739> also<00:03:52.859> do<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.370> body<00:03:53.579> armor
