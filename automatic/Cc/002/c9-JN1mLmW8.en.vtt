daughter

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
daughter

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
daughter
I<00:01:36.990> didn't<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.560> about<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.829> with<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.070> first<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I didn't know about up with my first and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.450 
I didn't know about up with my first and
like<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.570> fears<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.439> much<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.829> soon<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.250> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
like it fears so much as soon as I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
like it fears so much as soon as I
dropped<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.509> there<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.899> had<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> big

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
dropped it in there and I had like a big

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.310 
dropped it in there and I had like a big
head<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> foam<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> way<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> here

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
head of foam like all the way up to here

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.340 
head of foam like all the way up to here
so<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> definitely<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:48.570> very<00:01:48.960> different

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
so this is definitely a very different

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
so this is definitely a very different
result<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:49.890> I've<00:01:50.130> gotten<00:01:50.399> before<00:01:50.600> even

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
result to what I've gotten before even

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.450 
result to what I've gotten before even
when<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:51.930> pregnant<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.500> tried<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.040> um<00:01:54.110> like

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
when not pregnant I tried it and um like

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.959

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it fair still so me in the morning it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
it fair still so me in the morning it
should<00:02:00.390> still<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.350> acidic<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:03.049> yes<00:02:04.049> my
