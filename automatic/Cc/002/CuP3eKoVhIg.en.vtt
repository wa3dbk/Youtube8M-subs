00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
trying to get that gets much harder at

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.050 
trying to get that gets much harder at
the<00:06:16.300> stable<00:06:16.630> like<00:06:16.780> more<00:06:17.050> waiting<00:06:18.060> being

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
the stable like more waiting being

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.580

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
AI on arches if you rewind that and you

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.100 
AI on arches if you rewind that and you
watch<00:06:36.100> those<00:06:36.310> arches<00:06:36.700> they<00:06:37.660> do<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.930> most

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
watch those arches they do the most

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.110 
watch those arches they do the most
stupid<00:06:38.680> things<00:06:38.920> they're<00:06:39.310> on<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:39.550> same<00:06:39.730> spot

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
stupid things they're on the same spot

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.570 
stupid things they're on the same spot
somebody<00:06:40.420> walk<00:06:40.780> away<00:06:41.310> some<00:06:42.310> of<00:06:42.400> them<00:06:42.460> will

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
somebody walk away some of them will

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.150 
somebody walk away some of them will
take<00:06:42.790> a<00:06:42.820> different<00:06:43.090> war<00:06:43.800> caught<00:06:44.800> it<00:06:44.890> on<00:06:44.950> video

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
come on supercell fix that um and

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.840 
come on supercell fix that um and
then<00:06:49.630> boom<00:06:50.020> he<00:06:50.320> was<00:06:50.620> look<00:06:51.310> at<00:06:51.400> this<00:06:51.490> high<00:06:51.820> level

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
then boom he was look at this high level

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.350 
then boom he was look at this high level
tower<00:06:52.270> doesn't<00:06:52.600> really<00:06:52.810> do<00:06:52.960> much<00:06:52.990> to<00:06:53.350> bear<00:06:54.360> in

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
tower doesn't really do much to bear in

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.360 
tower doesn't really do much to bear in
mind<00:06:55.420> eventually<00:06:56.260> it<00:06:56.320> does<00:06:56.470> but<00:06:56.890> you<00:06:57.190> know

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
mind eventually it does but you know

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.980 
mind eventually it does but you know
it's<00:06:57.640> not<00:06:57.760> all<00:06:57.910> that<00:06:58.060> much<00:06:58.240> difference<00:06:58.720> come

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
it's not all that much difference come

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.620 
it's not all that much difference come
out<00:06:59.110> like<00:06:59.320> a<00:06:59.380> little<00:06:59.740> a<00:06:59.860> tour<00:07:00.100> level<00:07:00.630> live

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
out like a little a tour level live

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.530 
out like a little a tour level live
online<00:07:03.120> tower<00:07:04.120> so<00:07:04.630> that's<00:07:04.870> our<00:07:05.080> final<00:07:06.540> result

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
online tower so that's our final result

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.300 
online tower so that's our final result
which<00:07:07.660> is<00:07:07.780> pretty<00:07:07.960> good<00:07:08.230> I<00:07:08.560> need<00:07:08.800> to<00:07:08.920> do<00:07:09.070> next

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
which is pretty good I need to do next

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.130 
which is pretty good I need to do next
and<00:07:09.580> gold<00:07:09.940> and<00:07:10.210> I<00:07:10.390> definitely<00:07:10.570> need<00:07:10.990> with<00:07:11.110> the

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.140 
and gold and I definitely need with the

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.090 
and gold and I definitely need with the
trophy<00:07:11.410> so<00:07:13.170> my<00:07:14.170> next<00:07:14.350> video<00:07:14.590> is<00:07:14.680> most<00:07:14.860> probably

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
trophy so my next video is most probably

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.850 
trophy so my next video is most probably
going<00:07:15.340> to<00:07:15.400> be<00:07:15.520> me<00:07:15.730> getting<00:07:16.000> over<00:07:16.650> 2600<00:07:17.650> mark

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
going to be me getting over 2600 mark

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.050 
going to be me getting over 2600 mark
and<00:07:18.580> I<00:07:18.940> think<00:07:19.210> into<00:07:19.540> a<00:07:19.570> new<00:07:19.960> league<00:07:20.490> I<00:07:21.490> think<00:07:22.000> a

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
and I think into a new league I think a

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.380 
and I think into a new league I think a
new<00:07:22.180> leak<00:07:22.360> started<00:07:22.780> like<00:07:24.720> 2599<00:07:25.720> so<00:07:27.240> keep<00:07:28.240> eye

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
new leak started like 2599 so keep eye

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.090 
new leak started like 2599 so keep eye
out<00:07:28.510> keep<00:07:28.960> updated<00:07:29.440> and<00:07:29.590> just<00:07:29.770> watch<00:07:29.919> the

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 
out keep updated and just watch the

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.700 
out keep updated and just watch the
space<00:07:30.370> and<00:07:30.640> I'll<00:07:30.730> be<00:07:30.850> back<00:07:31.260> be<00:07:32.260> back<00:07:32.290> in<00:07:32.650> a

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
space and I'll be back be back in a

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.010 
space and I'll be back be back in a
little<00:07:32.860> bit
