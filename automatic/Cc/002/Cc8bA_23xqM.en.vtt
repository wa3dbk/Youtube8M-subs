smaller as you can see here and it's a
lot<00:04:57.710> more<00:04:57.860> dense<00:04:58.130> where<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:58.430> has<00:04:58.640> a<00:04:58.669> lot<00:04:58.850> more

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880

a<00:05:00.919> little<00:05:01.100> bit<00:05:01.340> more<00:05:01.490> dense<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.360> this<00:05:02.630> one<00:05:02.780> is

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
a little bit more dense and this one is

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.200 
a little bit more dense and this one is

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
blending this is great to do your

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.000 
blending this is great to do your
initial<00:05:08.270> transition<00:05:08.660> color<00:05:09.020> or<00:05:09.320> blend<00:05:09.770> alone

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
initial transition color or blend alone

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.820 
initial transition color or blend alone
loin<00:05:10.280> here<00:05:10.490> this<00:05:10.700> one's<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:10.940> little<00:05:11.030> bit<00:05:11.270> firmer

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
loin here this one's a little bit firmer

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.409 
loin here this one's a little bit firmer
so<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:12.919> gets<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.280> little<00:05:13.610> bit<00:05:13.850> more<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.120> give

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
so it gets a little bit more of give

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:15.670
