 body area 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.810
 which I fought from the male extremely 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.709
 poisonous and when bitten, he injects especially 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.420
 large doses of poison symptoms include themselves 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.670

 this species can grow to five 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.730
 centimeters in diameter and they dwell in

 deserts and sandy areas of africa 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.400
 also like camels these spiders can live 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.500
 a long time without water and food according to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.860
 researchers up to 1 year 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.840
 6 eyes sand spider for sand digging 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.870
 and patiently waiting when the victim 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.269
 close enough that bite 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.570
 spider is particularly dangerous for 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.530
 man's all because i'm from 6 eyes to 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.630
 shortbread bunch 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.820
 is a powerful toxin which 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.110
 dilutes the blood 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.500
 leads to tissue breakdown and causes 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.900
 rupture of blood vessels is even worse then 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.500
 that for this poison exists 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.570
 antidotes and finally the most dangerous 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.730
 the spider is a brazilian wandering 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.830
 spider 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.720
 This spider does not spins a web of sex 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.180
 wander through south america 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.760
 clean feet I love to crawl people's homes 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.280
 so meeting him is real 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.830
 2000 10th year brazilian wandering 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.550
 spider included in the Guinness Book of Records 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.190
 like the most poisonous spider in the world he 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.310
 very aggressive typing during bite 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.040
 very powerful neurotoxin paralyzing 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.400
 breathing and causing subsequent choking 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.490
 and another effect from its rowan berries 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.930
 causing an erection leading to 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.780
 complete impotence 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.240
 however i am being studied as a possible way 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.190
 sexual dysfunction solutions have been 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.860
 fatal case among people even 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:20.459
 after the antidote was administered after 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:22.560
 bite on it all is good that nature 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.540
 created a bunch of small ones only 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.300
 imagine if they were the size 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.310
 let's say with a yard dog then hike in 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.100
 forest for mushrooms would be a real feat 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.470
