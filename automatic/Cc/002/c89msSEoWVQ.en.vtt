00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080 
salt and pepper and garlic we're going
to<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.659> thing<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> grill<00:01:35.090> I'm

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to get this thing out on the grill I'm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.429 
to get this thing out on the grill I'm
going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> show<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.020> second

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
going to show you that in just a second

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
going to show you that in just a second
but<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.979> let's<00:01:38.369> try<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:39.000> some

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but that's it let's try it into some

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.260 
but that's it let's try it into some
ways<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:40.200> three<00:01:40.799> point<00:01:41.250> three<00:01:41.340> pounds<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
ways about three point three pounds and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
ways about three point three pounds and
that's<00:01:42.390> typical<00:01:42.869> usually<00:01:43.530> tri-tips<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.159> two

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that's typical usually tri-tips or two

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
that's typical usually tri-tips or two
to<00:01:44.369> three<00:01:44.549> pounds<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> normal<00:01:45.600> size

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
to three pounds that's the normal size

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
to three pounds that's the normal size
and<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.649> comes<00:01:46.829> from<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.189> sirloin

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
and what it is it comes from the sirloin

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.670 
and what it is it comes from the sirloin
the<00:01:48.210> tip<00:01:48.450> end<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:49.140> why<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.439> shaped

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
the tip end of it that's why it's shaped

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.060 
the tip end of it that's why it's shaped
like<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.159> I'll<00:01:50.880> show<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.119> how<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.659> cook<00:01:52.590> try

right<00:02:37.350> up<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.590> temp<00:02:37.860> then<00:02:38.250> we're<00:02:38.370> going<00:02:38.489> to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
right up to temp then we're going to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.070 
right up to temp then we're going to
move<00:02:38.730> these<00:02:38.910> racks<00:02:39.150> over<00:02:39.540> right<00:02:39.750> over<00:02:39.989> the

fire and I'm going to sear it on both
sides<00:02:42.300> for<00:02:42.570> about<00:02:42.690> three<00:02:42.930> minutes

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.240 

okay<00:02:47.189> once<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.000> tri-tip<00:02:48.239> got<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> run<00:02:50.129> at

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
okay once the tri-tip got up to a run at

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.640 
okay once the tri-tip got up to a run at
115<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.209> went<00:02:51.569> ahead<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:51.780> set<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.260> yoader<00:02:52.469> up

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
115 I went ahead and set the yoader up

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.140 
115 I went ahead and set the yoader up
for<00:02:52.799> direct<00:02:53.159> drillings<00:02:53.579> I<00:02:53.670> want<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.879> move<00:02:54.000> it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
for direct drillings I want to move it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.259 
for direct drillings I want to move it
right<00:02:54.329> over<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.409> this<00:02:55.739> fire<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:56.939> looking

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
right over on this fire and it's looking

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.880 
right over on this fire and it's looking
really<00:02:57.329> good<00:02:57.540> but<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:58.019> got<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.230> get<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.349> sear<00:02:58.680> on

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
really good but we got to get a sear on

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.110 
really good but we got to get a sear on
it<00:02:58.920> cuz<00:02:59.129> this<00:02:59.219> is<00:02:59.370> how<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.519> reverse<00:02:59.879> sear

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
it cuz this is how the reverse sear

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.000 
it cuz this is how the reverse sear
works<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:01.170> I'm<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.409> going<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.590> put<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.829> right

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.160 
works so I'm just going to put it right
over<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.400> heat<00:03:02.609> time<00:03:03.390> about<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.689> minute<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.109> a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
over the heat time about a minute and a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.800 
over the heat time about a minute and a
half<00:03:04.379> give<00:03:05.159> it<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.370> twist<00:03:05.670> another<00:03:06.420> minute<00:03:06.750> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
half give it a twist another minute a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.599 
half give it a twist another minute a
half<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.260> I'm<00:03:07.319> going<00:03:07.439> to<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> other<00:03:07.709> side<00:03:08.010> and

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
half and I'm going to the other side and

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.740 
half and I'm going to the other side and
it's<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.060> right<00:03:09.269> where<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> want<00:03:09.689> to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
it's going to be right where I want to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.020 
it's going to be right where I want to
write<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.959> 125<00:03:10.530> rings<00:03:11.159> I'm<00:03:11.489> gonna<00:03:11.609> let<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.730> rest

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
write it 125 rings I'm gonna let it rest

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.420 
write it 125 rings I'm gonna let it rest
and<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.049> cooked<00:03:13.290> about<00:03:13.590> 130<00:03:14.099> it'll<00:03:14.370> be

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and so I cooked about 130 it'll be

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.410 
and so I cooked about 130 it'll be
perfect<00:03:15.170> but<00:03:16.170> let<00:03:16.409> me<00:03:16.469> get<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> timer<00:03:16.889> going<00:03:17.420> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
perfect but let me get a timer going and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.059 
perfect but let me get a timer going and
we'll<00:03:18.689> show<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.139> other<00:03:19.409> side<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.980> a

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
we'll show you the other side just a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.340 
we'll show you the other side just a
second

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.210 

all<00:03:25.350> right<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.500> spent<00:03:25.710> about<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.890> minute<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.160> a

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
all right I spent about a minute and a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.950 
all right I spent about a minute and a
half<00:03:26.250> now<00:03:26.670> I'm<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:26.820> gonna<00:03:26.970> give<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.180> try

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
half now I'm just gonna give it a try

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.910 
half now I'm just gonna give it a try
typically<00:03:28.550> in<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.610> grill<00:03:29.850> marks<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.920> time

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
typically in the grill marks on time

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.080 
typically in the grill marks on time
another<00:03:32.190> minute<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.550> half

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090

all right it's been a total of three

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.160 
all right it's been a total of three
minutes<00:03:38.099> on<00:03:38.280> one<00:03:38.519> side<00:03:38.720> now<00:03:39.720> we're<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.049> going

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
minutes on one side now we're just going

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.160 
minutes on one side now we're just going
to<00:03:40.200> go<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.620> same<00:03:40.890> thing<00:03:41.659> get<00:03:42.659> some<00:03:42.840> marks

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
to go to the same thing get some marks

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.640 
to go to the same thing get some marks
on<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.500> up<00:03:44.099> all<00:03:44.879> right<00:03:44.939> this<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> last

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
on this up all right this is the last

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.330 
on this up all right this is the last
rotation<00:03:46.650> get<00:03:47.250> those<00:03:47.459> marks<00:03:47.640> on<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.000> side

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
rotation get those marks on that side

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.250 
rotation get those marks on that side
one<00:03:50.340> more<00:03:50.519> minute<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.849> half<00:03:51.079> we'll<00:03:52.079> check

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
one more minute and a half we'll check

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.420 
one more minute and a half we'll check
it<00:03:52.379> internal<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:52.980> should<00:03:53.159> be<00:03:53.250> right<00:03:53.370> around

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it internal it should be right around

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.180 
it internal it should be right around
130

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.310 

all<00:03:57.730> right<00:03:57.910> it's<00:03:58.180> been<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> total<00:03:59.080> of<00:03:59.140> three

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
all right it's been a total of three

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.680 
all right it's been a total of three
minutes<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.710> that<00:03:59.860> side<00:04:00.130> as<00:04:00.310> well<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:00.690> that's

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
minutes on that side as well so that's

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.720 
minutes on that side as well so that's
the<00:04:01.990> reverse<00:04:02.380> here<00:04:02.740> we<00:04:03.040> brought<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.460> tri-tip

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
the reverse here we brought the tri-tip

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.760 
the reverse here we brought the tri-tip
up<00:04:04.180> slow<00:04:04.540> now<00:04:05.290> I'm<00:04:05.470> going<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.680> get<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:05.950> all<00:04:06.130> and

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
up slow now I'm going to get it all and

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.200 
up slow now I'm going to get it all and
the<00:04:08.770> most<00:04:08.980> critical<00:04:09.400> part<00:04:09.580> take<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:09.940> in<00:04:10.060> and

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
the most critical part take it in and

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.840 
the most critical part take it in and
let<00:04:10.330> it<00:04:10.450> rest<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.530> needs<00:04:11.560> about<00:04:11.920> 10<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.460> 15

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
let it rest it needs about 10 to 15

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.180 
let it rest it needs about 10 to 15
minutes<00:04:13.060> covering<00:04:14.020> up<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.200> full<00:04:14.470> Loosli<00:04:15.010> just

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
minutes covering up a full Loosli just

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.190 
minutes covering up a full Loosli just
let<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.400> sit<00:04:15.610> here<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.850> calm<00:04:16.060> down<00:04:16.299> but<00:04:17.049> what

let it sit here and calm down but what

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.830 
let it sit here and calm down but what
we<00:04:17.290> did<00:04:17.470> we<00:04:17.620> started<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.310> out<00:04:18.400> low<00:04:18.760> brought<00:04:19.720> it

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
we did we started it out low brought it

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.780 
we did we started it out low brought it
up<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.080> about<00:04:20.230> 115<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.220> then<00:04:21.310> seared<00:04:21.580> it<00:04:21.700> off

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
up to about 115 and then seared it off

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.390 
up to about 115 and then seared it off
real<00:04:22.120> objects<00:04:22.570> rested<00:04:23.200> about<00:04:23.440> 10<00:04:23.740> minutes<00:04:24.070> and

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
real objects rested about 10 minutes and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.890 
real objects rested about 10 minutes and
that's<00:04:24.520> all<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.670> can<00:04:24.850> take<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.270> got<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.600> try<00:04:25.840> this

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
that's all I can take I got to try this

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.110 
that's all I can take I got to try this
thing<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.680> looking<00:04:26.980> juicy<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.820> just

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
thing but it's looking juicy and just

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.450 
thing but it's looking juicy and just
like<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> brisket<00:04:29.140> flat<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.560> want<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.830> slice<00:04:30.130> it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
like a brisket flat you want to slice it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.000 
like a brisket flat you want to slice it
against<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.390> grain<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:32.080> way<00:04:32.230> it's<00:04:32.590> not<00:04:32.830> as

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
against the grain that way it's not as

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.010 
against the grain that way it's not as
tough<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.610> slice<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.690> grain<00:04:34.990> is

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
tough and you slice it so this grain is

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.020 
tough and you slice it so this grain is
kind<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.440> running<00:04:35.740> this<00:04:35.890> way<00:04:36.100> on<00:04:36.430> this<00:04:36.550> tri-tip

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
kind of running this way on this tri-tip

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.280 
kind of running this way on this tri-tip
so<00:04:37.240> I'm<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.450> going<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.660> start<00:04:37.870> right<00:04:38.020> here
