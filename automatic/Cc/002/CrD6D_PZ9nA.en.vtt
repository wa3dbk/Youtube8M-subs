fishies hanging on in there I'm nothing

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.780 
fishies hanging on in there I'm nothing
spectacular<00:00:07.200> they're<00:00:07.950> very<00:00:08.160> cheap<00:00:08.490> fish

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
spectacular they're very cheap fish

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.870 
spectacular they're very cheap fish
they're<00:00:09.630> called<00:00:09.900> damsels<00:00:10.790> damsels<00:00:11.790> in

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
they're called damsels damsels in

they're called damsels damsels in
distress<00:00:12.059> perhaps<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.990> don't<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.309> basically

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
distress perhaps I don't know basically

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.460 
distress perhaps I don't know basically
they're<00:00:14.519> guinea<00:00:14.700> pig<00:00:15.000> fish<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.599> hate<00:00:16.260> using

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
they're guinea pig fish I hate using

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.410 
they're guinea pig fish I hate using
that<00:00:16.710> because<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> sounds<00:00:17.340> very<00:00:17.490> cruel<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.150> in

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
that because it sounds very cruel but in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.990 
that because it sounds very cruel but in
order<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.080> get<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.730> ecosystem<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:20.850> my

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
order to get the the ecosystem for my

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.269 
order to get the the ecosystem for my
tank<00:00:21.330> starting<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> flourish<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
tank starting to flourish you have to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.509 
tank starting to flourish you have to
actually<00:00:23.430> create<00:00:24.060> um<00:00:25.039> really<00:00:26.039> kind<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> an

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
actually create um really kind of an

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.240 
actually create um really kind of an
environment<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.990> create<00:00:28.470> bacteria

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
environment you have to create bacteria

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.420 
environment you have to create bacteria
and<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:30.330> bacteria<00:00:30.990> has<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.590> feed<00:00:31.830> off<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and that bacteria has to feed off of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
and that bacteria has to feed off of
ammonia<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.120> mean<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> whole<00:00:33.960> system

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
ammonia I mean there's a whole system

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.830 
ammonia I mean there's a whole system
that<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> basically<00:00:35.790> create<00:00:36.480> that's

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that you have to basically create that's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.080 
that you have to basically create that's
why<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.110> takes<00:00:37.350> some<00:00:38.070> time<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.670> set<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
why it takes some time actually set a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.799 
why it takes some time actually set a
set<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.960> saltwater<00:00:40.680> tank<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:42.450> they

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
set up a saltwater tank so what they

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
set up a saltwater tank so what they
suggest<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.890> after<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.460> stabilize

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
suggest you do is after you stabilize

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.010 
suggest you do is after you stabilize
the<00:00:46.730> specific<00:00:47.730> gravity<00:00:47.760> level<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.690> just

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the specific gravity level which just

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.619 
the specific gravity level which just
refers<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> salt<00:00:50.399> content<00:00:51.090> basically

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
refers to the the salt content basically

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.569 
refers to the the salt content basically
once<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> stabilize<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.949> once<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
once you stabilize that once you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
once you stabilize that once you
stabilize<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.510> actual<00:00:55.079> um<00:00:56.510> temperature<00:00:57.510> then

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
stabilize the actual um temperature then

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.700 
stabilize the actual um temperature then
they<00:00:58.590> say<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> introduce<00:00:59.760> fish<00:01:00.539> uh<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.410> being

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
they say to introduce fish uh that being

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
they say to introduce fish uh that being
these<00:01:01.980> guys<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.399> there's<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.850> got<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> total

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
thumb is that for every inch of water

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.910 
thumb is that for every inch of water
you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.520> every<00:01:20.700> inch<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> fish<00:01:21.619> wait<00:01:22.619> no

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
you have for every inch of fish wait no

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
you have for every inch of fish wait no
how's<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.580> every<00:01:23.850> gallon<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.689> have

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
how's that go for every gallon you have

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.200 
how's that go for every gallon you have
one<00:01:25.110> inch<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.560> fish<00:01:25.799> basically<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.970> 12

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
one inch of fish basically so I have 12

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.469 
one inch of fish basically so I have 12
gallon<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> basically<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.430> 12<00:01:29.430> 1<00:01:30.240> inch

fish so I got these guys and like I said

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.830 
fish so I got these guys and like I said
they're<00:01:32.759> they're<00:01:33.000> Hardy<00:01:33.299> fish<00:01:33.540> they're

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
they're they're Hardy fish they're

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.960 
they're they're Hardy fish they're
they're<00:01:34.079> very<00:01:34.350> durable<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.820> add

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
they're very durable I'm about to add

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.490 
they're very durable I'm about to add
these<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.450> they've<00:01:36.659> been<00:01:36.840> sitting<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.380> in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
these in they've been sitting here in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.280 
these in they've been sitting here in
this<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.310> tank<00:01:38.670> actually

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
this in the in the tank actually

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
this in the in the tank actually
acclimating<00:01:40.290> first<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.920> put<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.340> from

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
acclimating first I put them in from

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.139 
acclimating first I put them in from
with<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> water<00:01:42.470> from<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> actual<00:01:44.149> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
with the water from the actual the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.450 
with the water from the actual the
actual<00:01:45.689> store<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.799> them<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:46.950> they

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
actual store that I got them from they

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
actual store that I got them from they
sat<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.990> added<00:01:49.200> some<00:01:49.380> actual

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
sat in here then I added some actual

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
sat in here then I added some actual
water<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.610> tank<00:01:50.970> into<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.930> bag<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
water from my tank into the bag so that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.899 
water from my tank into the bag so that
they<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.009> used<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.759> used

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
they can get used to that and get used

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.010 
they can get used to that and get used
to<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> temperature<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> things<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.990> that

into<00:04:12.200> nitrites<00:04:13.200> which<00:04:13.830> then<00:04:14.670> will<00:04:14.880> break<00:04:15.120> down

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
into nitrites which then will break down

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.890 
into nitrites which then will break down
into<00:04:15.600> nitrates<00:04:16.260> which<00:04:17.299> it's<00:04:18.299> all<00:04:18.450> helped<00:04:18.750> out

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
into nitrates which it's all helped out

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.330 
into nitrates which it's all helped out
by<00:04:18.930> bacteria<00:04:19.829> so

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
