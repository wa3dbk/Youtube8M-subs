00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
see can be an image it's not like you're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.790

there's all this imagery that's right

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.930 
there's all this imagery that's right
there<00:00:35.530> macro<00:00:36.530> photography<00:00:36.680> lets<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.430> get

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
right and close get that magnification

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.010 
right and close get that magnification
that<00:00:40.640> gives<00:00:41.180> you<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.450> image<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:41.930> you

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
that gives you the image that you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.540 
that gives you the image that you
normally<00:00:42.350> wouldn't<00:00:42.530> get<00:00:42.739> from<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.340> typical

both<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.850> them<00:00:52.969> are<00:00:53.120> amazing<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.949> kind<00:00:55.250> of

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
both of them are amazing and I kind of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.939 
both of them are amazing and I kind of
go<00:00:55.820> one<00:00:56.149> between<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.629> other<00:00:56.780> depending<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:57.739> my

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
go one between the other depending on my

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.020 
go one between the other depending on my
working<00:00:58.309> distance<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.879> working

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
working distance so in working

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.450 
working distance so in working
rattlesnakes<00:00:59.660> I'll<00:00:59.899> work<00:01:00.379> with<00:01:00.410> 180<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.250> if

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
rattlesnakes I'll work with 180 and if

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.210 
rattlesnakes I'll work with 180 and if
we're<00:01:01.609> working<00:01:01.760> snails<00:01:02.210> I'll<00:01:02.510> go<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.960> 90

today I'm shooting with my newest lens
this<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.290> latest<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.860> tamron's<00:01:10.330> macro

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
this is the latest in tamron's macro

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.860 
this is the latest in tamron's macro

macro lens it shoots one to one like the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.260 
macro lens it shoots one to one like the
other<00:01:17.990> macro<00:01:18.380> lenses<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:19.160> also<00:01:19.340> has<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.670> great

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
other macro lenses it also has a great

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.730 
other macro lenses it also has a great
working<00:01:20.510> distance<00:01:21.020> from<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.260> front<00:01:21.500> element

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
working distance from the front element

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.400 
working distance from the front element
of<00:01:22.010> four<00:01:22.550> inches<00:01:22.820> or<00:01:22.970> 100<00:01:23.270> millimetres<00:01:23.720> this

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
of four inches or 100 millimetres this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.880 
of four inches or 100 millimetres this
is<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.710> DI<00:01:24.980> 2<00:01:25.610> lens<00:01:26.270> which<00:01:26.960> means<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:27.500> made

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
is the DI 2 lens which means it's made

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.790 
is the DI 2 lens which means it's made
specifically<00:01:28.520> for<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.000> smaller<00:01:29.360> sensor<00:01:29.930> the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
specifically for the smaller sensor the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.130 
specifically for the smaller sensor the
aps-c<00:01:31.220> sensor<00:01:32.060> which<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.390> in<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.540> majority<00:01:32.690> of

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
aps-c sensor which is in the majority of

aps-c sensor which is in the majority of
the<00:01:33.980> cameras<00:01:34.370> that<00:01:34.400> are<00:01:34.520> out<00:01:34.610> there<00:01:34.730> it's

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
the cameras that are out there it's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.900 
the cameras that are out there it's
comparable<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.800> 90<00:01:37.250> millimeter<00:01:37.640> in<00:01:37.820> a

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
comparable to the 90 millimeter in a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.930 
comparable to the 90 millimeter in a
full-frame<00:01:38.390> format<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:40.040> lens<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.520> really

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
full-frame format this lens is really

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.510 
full-frame format this lens is really
fast<00:01:41.210> fastest<00:01:42.110> lens<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.470> its<00:01:42.560> class<00:01:42.770> at<00:01:43.010> f/2<00:01:43.490> o

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
fast fastest lens in its class at f/2 o

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.360 
fast fastest lens in its class at f/2 o
and<00:01:44.210> what<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.050> does<00:01:45.290> for<00:01:45.650> me<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:45.920> allows<00:01:46.130> me

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
and what that does for me it allows me

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.420 
and what that does for me it allows me
to<00:01:46.550> have<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> really<00:01:47.330> shallow<00:01:47.600> depth<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.230> field

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
to have a really shallow depth of field

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.800 
to have a really shallow depth of field
backgrounds<00:01:49.430> go<00:01:49.550> soft<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.120> for<00:01:50.480> macro

photography<00:01:51.730> backgrounds<00:01:52.730> are<00:01:52.850> huge<00:01:53.120> when

photography backgrounds are huge when

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.690 
photography backgrounds are huge when
you<00:01:53.840> can<00:01:54.020> really<00:01:54.680> make<00:01:54.830> that<00:01:54.980> background<00:01:55.430> go

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
you can really make that background go

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.570 
you can really make that background go
soft<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.600> creates<00:01:57.080> less<00:01:57.440> distraction<00:01:58.280> for<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
soft it creates less distraction for the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.610 
soft it creates less distraction for the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
allowed me to get it really close and

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.580 
allowed me to get it really close and
shoot<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.120> proboscis<00:02:26.540> has<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.080> all<00:02:27.230> curled

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
there's just no depth of field so it's

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.380

photographers<00:03:26.750> worst<00:03:27.080> nightmare<00:03:27.620> because

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
photographers worst nightmare because

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.410 
photographers worst nightmare because
you<00:03:28.100> have<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> subject<00:03:28.700> that's<00:03:28.970> jumping<00:03:29.180> around

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
you have a subject that's jumping around

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.920 
you have a subject that's jumping around
so<00:03:29.870> tripods<00:03:30.650> are<00:03:30.800> great<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:32.000> keeps<00:03:32.270> you<00:03:32.480> solid

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
so tripods are great it keeps you solid

wait<00:03:34.940> for<00:03:35.750> your<00:03:35.840> subject<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.290> slow<00:03:36.560> down<00:03:36.770> today

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610
