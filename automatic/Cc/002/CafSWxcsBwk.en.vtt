00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.649
 pedro is here for you another video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.190
 Where am I bringing you a box of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.870
 my new intel core i5 4570 processor 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.210
 I'll talk a little about it. 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.369
 some settings of it is such detail 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.060
 and where I bought I bought in pixar 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.470
 www.shell.com.br will be going through 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.019
 image below will have a link from the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.789
 product and store description as 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 You want to take a look there he is 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.750
 a very good teacher, same guy 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.239
 he is an 1150 lg he has his cast 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 r 1150 this fourth generation of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.570
 processors 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.309
 it has a hd graphics 4.600 then 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.379
 when I buy the motherboard that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.940
 I'll probably buy next month already 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 photo 3 days a month but last 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.620
 When you bought the motherboard, you 're going to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 for me to record some 336 km on account 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.980
 of this motherboard 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.539
 the board is not mistaken if it is integrated 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.370
 I think it 's a board should be should be 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.160
 very good if I had cheated the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.989
 sub 20 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.820
 I bought it on pixar everything arrived 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 Right, I recommend you buy tin cans. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.510
 the pistol has a price until that good 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.780
 also that I paid a higher price 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 salted in it 680 with the freight 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.760
 I think it only right I paid but only fred 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 finally it 's an expensive processor that is very 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 top of the line unfortunately I'll need 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.790
 from a motherboard spout to 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 endure it but this is the least 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.479
 because I think it 's a very 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.159
 good the indemnity to hear some videos 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.650
 it is very good even cooler that comes with 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.750
 it is very silent then it compensates 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.509
 totally you buy it is a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 teacher, no doubt very good then 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.090
 I want to do this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.009
 processor I got this processor 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.259
 to me because I'm riding a 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.509
 computer nintendo game i think it is 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.310
 everyone knows that it is a peach tree that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.810
 wheel games games at last lets you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 know about it would also solve is is a 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.439
 very good processor so I want 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.670
 buy I bought it as the first 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.860
 part of my gamer pc 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.759
 then I will buy there the mother after the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.770
 video card and the source'd better have the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.350
 Most incredible order against going to buy 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090
 These pieces are worth doing if you realize it. 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.459
 The game that I want is a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.520
 face teacher is very good indeed and I saw 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.770
 I've heard several videos about him 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.030
 not if it's all right that he's a 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 bit expensive but but that's because it 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.010
 offers for you or less but is a 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.720
 good processor even I'm recording 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.370
 choose above I 'm not seeing here in the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.110
 universe did not play direct or old 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.240
 because it has some editing and such 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.280
 I do not know how to do this but I'm recording 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.030
 so you're seeing in boxing 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.500
 of my processor do not 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.090
 I wanted to apologize for French 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.440
 image quality because I 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.970
 was recording on tablet 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.710
 and that's when I was holding it 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.480
 then you may not have the support that neither the 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.460
 camera type in the camera I put a 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.020
 tripod her and she is in paradinho 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.670
 tablet was not going to mess with what I wanted 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.340
 apologize for the whole house process 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.300
 some people have hepatitis I know 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.810
 that has nothing to do with this one 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.580
 New student, so I wanted to ask. 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.200
 excuses - the image quality that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.530
 it will be even bocós that the image of the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.270
 It's the right time for the tablet to move. 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.460
 It's not going to be very cool, I'm sort of 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.040
 of ability but it hurts 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.590
 good to a teacher is very good he has 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.650
 some formulas specifications for you 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.480
 He's a burial. 4545 70 He can not. 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.320
 to overclock because I do not have it in 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.270
 final né 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.430
 but will be a teacher of the hour 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.720
 even for the audio has already passed the size 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.430
 of the video so I'll leave the pace more 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.010
 slow but let's go back to the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.940
 specifications of the teacher he has 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.930
 3.2 ghz with the turbo boost it will 3.4 if 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.430
 I'm not mistaken, I do not see 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.870
 processor then you are talking 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.030
 Something wrong, I'm sorry. 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.959
 he has an intel graphics hd 4670 for 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.959
 You are very good and what else does he come? 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.180
 The course is the same normal teacher. 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.890
 he is the fourth generation teacher he 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.540
 Already 1 50 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.130
 and I think that 's just the way I am 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.990
 I have to tell you what I understand 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.750
 at least I think that's it 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.400
 so excuse me if the video does not 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.430
 It was so good because of the quality. 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.380
 image and such but I'll try 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.090
 improve this right more forward 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.230
 Thinking about boxing, this is it. 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.910
 even though the first 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.890
 the first video of the series the box that 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.270
 I'm making you look like I hope you 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.980
 If you liked the one 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.190
 a favorite to help in the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.540
 then the company is there 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.540
 Until the next I spoke
