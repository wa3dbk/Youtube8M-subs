00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.310
 it's also the idea is it today a little tutorial stage in the sun 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.519
 sunday the bce meant for 6-7 vanneste 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.329
 agree pretty simplistic fa 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.039
 relative 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.939
 neptune on eating khartoum afp chords that all edges 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 in the first place we will see more the mining 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 we will see what is called the wind 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.960
 but we knew it was a it's like stage in the difference that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.030
 finger so on the third box of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 the agreement of italy head 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.970
 for my part I'm hungry 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.070
 I will do that will be all for the chords 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.970
 small subtlety on the floor 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.970
 the c6 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 the trend 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.590
 for that we will start with the fouquet's clan 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.500
 so this is simple you will see two agreements so we will use 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.510
 the minor and for 100 th the agreement for the city the only site 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.250
 highest level of the un plan level first put the miners have 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.450
 then congratulated 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 Sunday he agreed 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.350
 so it's pretty simple level of the replica we're going to do a descent on 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.620
 the miners he goes down on the g6 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 that it's going to give something like this 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.890
 and so on so 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.460
 and so singing for the sector and something like 50 pc a year 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.469
 insider th 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.129
 here is a dive like that 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 in fact m these four times so that this sequence 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.929
 but for afp to see all the prices that the three 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.419
 so then we'll go to what I learned football so that's 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.389
 maybe a hard part of the couple etc but a release a change of 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.179
 pace which is a percent change of agreement compared to others what 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.329
 I liked you I preferred this part 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.329
 more and more he wants explanations 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.289
 dance in this tournament we'll have to level chords should take place 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.339
 end 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.809
 always our our sausage 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.739
 and to an adult 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.159
 but what is it going to give at the level of the sequences so shapes 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.059
 and for Saturday 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.059
 so that's what it gives 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.789
 5% 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.509
 So here we are at the level of the republic against the propose 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:22.999
 bada os all that 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.939
 we are going to have a cure 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.939
 we will see 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.409
 and in fact when the morning chord change a cornel wilde climb 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.000
 so that's what will give us for what you are what I come from you 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.510
 at the level or level of the singing when comes makelele 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.459
 it's a misplaced word it's difficult 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.459
 the fund takes the pulse of the twentieth century 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.959
 if needed 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.619
 miller ni m 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.619
 so here is a little bit 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.669
 so that's for this price 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.169
 but not then we will go to the pot roses frank so the role the chorus 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.959
 is still a different ethnicity and still a sequence in a decor 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.569
 different 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.500
 so at the level of ouaga chords 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.099
 we will see the images 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.949
 this time due from the back 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.620
 still our g 6 6% during the chorus 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.520
 the same 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.659
 even the party but we are replaced by one 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.560
 normal month according to the Chileans the sound is almost the same 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.279
 and for those who stopped 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.279
 once the lot france how do i 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.720
 that's the context 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.779
 the young woman was gasoline smothered with the hand 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.779
 so that's three runs 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.990
 so I have to play in motion when changing the chore a 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.120
 descent and toufflers 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.120
 you follow 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.620
 so that has prepared the level 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.580
 at the seat of parliament 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.759
 it's going to give something like this 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.029
 the times 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.879
 foot 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.300
 next week 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.449
 according to regions 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.449
 in this area at he said 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.740
 but it's him 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.169
 the world is happy about 100 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.060
 and so here 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.840
 we like that we saw the main the main phases of the 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.900
 piece 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.240
 ending with the offer 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.310
 so just to add a moment there is a little break on a small break 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.139
 musical 6 goals 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.979
 last year ap 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.550
 second chorus 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.819
 according to the chorus of the second prize so this little musical break he has the 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:15.979
 same agreements as 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.319
 it is composed of the same chords that we pick up 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.319
 namely the minor ground 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.119
 and lorient 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:29.409
 so these agreements we will be able to have a little fun and apply 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:30.930
 a little bit customized 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.639
 so I'm not going to detail the rhythmic that it's little interest and 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.449
 then luck 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.860
 I think the foul every 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.340
 every time I play so the rhythmic ol funky common something 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.340
 we refuse to make a break 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.569
 angel 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.430
 this is his house 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.360
 but there you are free to do 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.830
 place to your imagination so here to find for the pieces played 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.389
 that I have pretty much everything 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.749
 why for this little tutorial so on the song bane vaguely chiba so I 

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:24.770
 remind that the benefit is available on youtube you have 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.599
 imagined at the beginning the videos 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:27.800
 I also recall that 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800
 again proposes a table export version 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.619
 his songs 

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.199
 so this deployment of this hole 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.860
 the description of the video and on the forum 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.860
 eric piermont legitimate president 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.800
 more than two years 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.410
 tagetik we are talking about I wish a lot of success and then a year ago 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:47.749
 before 

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:49.069
 Estrosi 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:50.389
 it's the team tour
