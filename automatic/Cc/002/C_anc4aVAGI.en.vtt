00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.860
 this time microsoft thinks that 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.530
 some discarded characteristics of 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.760
 xbox one could return a lot of eye 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.559
 because we could talk about issues 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.510
 as controversial as the connection 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.790
 mandatory internet or that attention 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.400
 because the controversy is raised again 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.789
 around xbox one the vice president 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.039
 xbox corporate in microsoft insists 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.369
 eye in that some of those functions of 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.980
 discarded from xbox one of functions that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.290
 they received harsh criticism could 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.739
 come back in the future we also talk 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.629
 of things as thorny as that system 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.820
 of limitation of sale of games of 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.040
 second hand eye because from microsoft 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.350
 they say we have to talk more do that 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.150
 people understand that it is our system 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.589
 it's a pity we have not done a 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 work as good as it would have been 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.370
 possible to make people 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.170
 understand where we are going is 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.629
 pay close attention to the words he tells us 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.369
 The first thing I want to do is launch the 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.739
 product but I also definitely want 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.380
 talk more about how we conceive those 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.600
 functions how xbox live works 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.520
 works the digital thing we have to work 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.890
 more to be able to talk about 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.450
 we're going to do because I think we were doing 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.789
 something different from what people 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.500
 perceived from microsoft assure us 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.869
 that we have never understood correctly 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.390
 policies that have been designed around 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.670
 xbox one eye because they live when you read 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.740
 things like that petition is concerned 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.750
 clearly to the online petition that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.030
 signed thousands of users to ask 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.069
 the company how did he finally 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.500
 remove the trm and the rest 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.110
 restrictions as eye says I think that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.149
 we received a lot of feedback and although xbox 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.130
 one was created to be digital native 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.649
 to have this awesome 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.989
 experience the online link we gave ourselves 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.060
 mind that people wanted options 

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:52.700
 they wanted what I like to call a 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.189
 bridge that is how they conceive the world 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.899
 current using more digital things and 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.909
 a lot of attention because although microsoft 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.590
 withdrew limitations restrictions of 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.929
 use and other elements that were 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.610
 criticized also withdrew functions that 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.349
 favored users as per 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.720
 example the system to share 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.410
 content among several users in a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.720
 console 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.239
 the family setting to return to 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.360
 current system in the present xbox 360 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.910
 a decision that was also controversial 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.880
 you already know that this favored the user 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.910
 and it was not a focus of complaints however the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.010
 Mr. Vicens opens the door to 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.440
 incorporate later, it indicates that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.450
 his withdrawal has been purely logistic 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.670
 and not linked to the rest of functions 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.070
 eliminated and I of course from here 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.740
 would send a message to the guys from 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.620
 microsoft a message as advice and it's 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.720
 you guys can not have everyone happy 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 the users or some or others but in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.320
 Any case I think the problem 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.080
 who has always had microsoft with xbox 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.970
 one is that they have not even believed in 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.340
 your own project something that has been a 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.060
 big mistake at least facing the public and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.060
 to the specialized press 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.550
 yes
