00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.120
 the first principle 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.000
 your life does not represent real life 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.469
 you live in a bubble inheritance in great 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.349
 part for your family traditions 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.770
 knowledge religions beliefs 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:24.470
 fears prejudices superstitions 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.419
 opinions views and 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.289
 complemented by the experiences of your 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.050
 own life 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.629
 if you analyze it very well you will notice 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.870
 that you are a byproduct of what 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.989
 They thought they said and they did others for you 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 without asking you what your concepts are 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.449
 religion or their beliefs vary not according to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.269
 the truth but your context 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.269
 socio-cultural you have asked some 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:54.890
 Once what would your beliefs 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.890
 if you were born in a doorway 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.570
 In Israel 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.380
 in India 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.159
 or in Tibet they would probably be very 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.370
 different from what you have now 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.100
 Then what makes you different 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.310
 the package of beliefs that they deposited 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.790
 in your mind you think with what you know 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.130
 and you say what you think but the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.800
 information that is in your mind was 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.900
 strategically placed there in the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.080
 the course of your life since you were 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.030
 child internalizes concepts that 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.520
 are part of your beliefs more 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.789
 deep and you never question you 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.940
 assuming 100% of its veracity alone 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.470
 because everyone believes that's why your world 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.440
 it becomes what you study 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.960
 and teach what they taught you in a 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.360
 endless educational system that to all 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.290
 coast seek information for your 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.170
 purposes 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.510
 when the uniform announces an adventure 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.630
 absent you dress in what makes you 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.690
 lack and everything you say are concepts 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.610
 borrowed you read in a book or 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.190
 you heard from someone who read it in a 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.420
 book forgetting that you are a being 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.880
 smart individual or are you from 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.000
 those who believe they were born on a planet 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.980
 designed for life to meet unique 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.470
 and exclusively a cycle like that of the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.110
 animals 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.030
 do 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.540
 grow 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.299
 and reproduce and die 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.250
 your reality in the bubble is nothing more than 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.530
 a set of mental programs 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.590
 taxes that you have largely 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.170
 acquired by the media 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.090
 that stop you from thinking clearly by 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.390
 that you do not accept what does not fit in your 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.310
 bubble and in most cases not 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.549
 you agree with the bubble of the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.849
 that's why humanity is divided 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:57.209
 and always will be while we're not 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.879
 in a state of collective consciousness the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.099
 arrogance does not let you see beyond what 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.739
 what's in your limited and conformist 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.490
 bubble because everyone thinks they have the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.850
 reason 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.640
 and he has it only inside his bubble 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.640
 and it is easier to refuse 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.220
 what you call your life 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.940
 it's your jail 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.230
 as comfortable and luxurious as it is and so you 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.340
 consider yourself different and independent 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.459
 you are still inside her 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.860
 the worst of all is that you do not realize 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.590
 and when your inside through your 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.590
 mind tries to free itself then 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.720
 and if that's still not enough, they fill 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.480
 of vices and make you believe that that is 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.410
 live life they put you to pursue a 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.260
 world of illusion 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.470
 the one that society has imposed on you to 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.930
 consider yourself someone worthwhile 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.870
 dream that you have accepted and you are looking for everything 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.080
 cost as the biggest goal to meet 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.870
 within 60 or 70 years that with 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.860
 luck you could live before the undeniable 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.560
 truth that provides intelligence 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.019
 not the belief 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.840
 the intelligence that will come to contend 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.440
 the worn and withered argument 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.690
 of the foolish and ignorant blind guides 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.940
 of the blind is time to see a new 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.520
 reality that can only be seen with the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.160
 eyes of intelligence there is the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.320
 true battle that you must wage the 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.990
 that overcomes ignorance and defeats the 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.940
 fanaticism 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.640
 the religions did what they had 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.860
 what to do to survive now they are 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.440
 agonizing is no longer space for 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.520
 fables of paradises and purgatories of the 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.520
 traffickers of the faith 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.639
 all right
