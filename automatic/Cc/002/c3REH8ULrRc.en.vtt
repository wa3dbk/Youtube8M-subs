00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
but I don't and the brick looks a lot

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.490 
but I don't and the brick looks a lot
smoother<00:04:22.070> like<00:04:22.310> stone<00:04:22.790> brick<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:24.020> they<00:04:24.260> kind

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
smoother like stone brick so they kind

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.020 
smoother like stone brick so they kind
of<00:04:24.560> match<00:04:25.040> a<00:04:25.490> lot<00:04:25.820> better<00:04:26.570> than<00:04:27.260> before<00:04:28.030> now

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
of match a lot better than before now

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.230 
of match a lot better than before now
they're<00:04:29.180> quartz<00:04:29.660> ooh<00:04:30.190> didn't<00:04:31.190> hit<00:04:31.640> now<00:04:32.180> the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
they're quartz ooh didn't hit now the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.180 
they're quartz ooh didn't hit now the
quartz<00:04:32.660> looks<00:04:33.050> like<00:04:33.290> all<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.710> other<00:04:33.890> ores

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
quartz looks like all the other ores

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.800 
quartz looks like all the other ores
like<00:04:34.880> iron

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
like iron

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.330 
like iron
or<00:04:36.139> coal<00:04:36.950> or<00:04:37.330> gold<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.410> it's<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:39.889> white

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
or coal or gold and so it's just white

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.230 
or coal or gold and so it's just white
instead<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.540> normal<00:04:42.880> another<00:04:43.880> quartz

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
instead of the normal another quartz

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.930 
instead of the normal another quartz
look<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.410> finally<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.070> wanted<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.460> show<00:04:46.700> off

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
look and finally I wanted to show off

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.060 
look and finally I wanted to show off
this<00:04:47.919> let's<00:04:48.919> close<00:04:49.220> up<00:04:49.250> that<00:04:50.530> this<00:04:51.530> is<00:04:51.830> what

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
this let's close up that this is what

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.460 
this let's close up that this is what
emeralds<00:04:52.730> look<00:04:52.940> like<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.630> they're<00:04:54.230> actually

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
emeralds look like and they're actually

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.240 
emeralds look like and they're actually
now<00:04:55.130> named<00:04:55.430> rubies<00:04:56.000> so<00:04:56.300> here's<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.950> single<00:04:57.950> ruby

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
now named rubies so here's a single ruby

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.050 
now named rubies so here's a single ruby
and<00:04:58.490> then<00:04:59.060> diamonds<00:05:00.190> look<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.340> little<00:05:01.550> bit<00:05:01.760> more

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
and then diamonds look a little bit more

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.420 
and then diamonds look a little bit more
like<00:05:02.300> normal<00:05:02.570> diamonds<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.100> kind<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.340> have

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
like normal diamonds and I kind of have

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.930 
like normal diamonds and I kind of have
that<00:05:04.490> original<00:05:04.850> blue<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:06.050> they<00:05:07.040> both<00:05:07.730> these

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
that original blue and they both these

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.700 
that original blue and they both these
textures<00:05:08.720> now<00:05:09.020> match

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
textures now match

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.460 
textures now match
also<00:05:10.490> when<00:05:10.760> you're<00:05:10.880> they're<00:05:11.270> found<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:12.020> the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
also when you're they're found in the

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.510 
also when you're they're found in the
world<00:05:12.850> they<00:05:13.850> look<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.540> lot<00:05:14.750> more<00:05:14.990> like<00:05:15.520> emerald

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
world they look a lot more like emerald

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.670 
world they look a lot more like emerald
the<00:05:16.970> default<00:05:17.540> emerald<00:05:17.930> with<00:05:18.140> the<00:05:18.260> colors

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
the default emerald with the colors

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.580 
the default emerald with the colors
changed<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:19.970> sort<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.720> emeralds<00:05:21.470> and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
changed so that sort of emeralds and

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.800 
changed so that sort of emeralds and
diamonds<00:05:22.040> look<00:05:22.550> about<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.000> same<00:05:23.270> when<00:05:23.690> you

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
diamonds look about the same when you

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.230 
diamonds look about the same when you
find<00:05:24.080> them<00:05:24.230> in<00:05:24.410> your<00:05:24.680> world<00:05:24.919> allots<00:05:25.700> the<00:05:25.910> same

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
find them in your world allots the same

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.060 
find them in your world allots the same
but<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:26.960> few<00:05:27.350> item<00:05:27.800> things<00:05:28.220> are<00:05:28.460> different<00:05:28.729> and

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
but a few item things are different and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.830 
but a few item things are different and
that<00:05:31.070> is<00:05:31.550> better<00:05:31.760> than<00:05:31.940> default<00:05:32.060> what's<00:05:32.720> also

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
that is better than default what's also

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.870 
that is better than default what's also
cool<00:05:33.080> is<00:05:33.320> that<00:05:33.740> there<00:05:33.919> are<00:05:34.070> alternative

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
cool is that there are alternative

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.270 
cool is that there are alternative
textures<00:05:35.479> within<00:05:35.780> this<00:05:36.050> texture<00:05:36.500> pack<00:05:36.530> so<00:05:36.979> if

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
textures within this texture pack so if

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.460 
textures within this texture pack so if
you<00:05:37.729> want<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.090> use<00:05:38.240> extra<00:05:38.690> textures<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.440> can

you want to use extra textures you can
