portions of my hair already have the gel
so<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.189> working<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> very<00:00:20.850> front

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
so I'm just working with the very front

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.810 
so I'm just working with the very front
I<00:00:22.550> am<00:00:23.550> low<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.660> product<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
I am low on this product so I have to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.419 
I am low on this product so I have to
like<00:00:26.970> pound<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.590> because<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.070> thick

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
like pound it out because it's so thick

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
like pound it out because it's so thick
it<00:00:29.580> doesn't<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.179> slide<00:00:30.510> down<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it doesn't just kind of slide down and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
it doesn't just kind of slide down and
which<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.800> why<00:00:31.920> probably<00:00:32.430> why<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> bottle<00:00:32.969> has

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
which is why probably why the bottle has

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.569 
which is why probably why the bottle has
a<00:00:33.120> pump<00:00:33.450> however<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.950> spread<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.399> well

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
a pump however if you spread it out well

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.670 
a pump however if you spread it out well
in<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:35.850> hands<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.510> easy<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.230> apply

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
in your hands it's really easy to apply

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.389 
in your hands it's really easy to apply
to<00:00:37.739> your<00:00:37.950> hair<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.399> wouldn't<00:00:39.360> try<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.280> spread<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
to your hair I wouldn't try to spread it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
to your hair I wouldn't try to spread it
out<00:00:41.489> once<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> put<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.809> your<00:00:42.930> hair<00:00:43.140> because

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
out once you put it in your hair because

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.970 
out once you put it in your hair because
it's<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.160> thickly<00:00:44.700> snotty<00:00:45.289> that<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.860> can

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it's so thickly snotty that as you can

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.209 
it's so thickly snotty that as you can
see<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.840> definitely<00:00:49.050> spread<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
see so I would definitely spread it in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.400 
see so I would definitely spread it in
your<00:00:50.340> hands<00:00:50.610> before<00:00:51.539> applying<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> your

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
your hands before applying it to your

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.310 
your hands before applying it to your
hair<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.210> color<00:00:54.420> allows<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
hair and it's the color allows you to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.119 
hair and it's the color allows you to
see<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.340> once<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.390> great

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
see it but once you do it's really great

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
see it but once you do it's really great
there's<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> lot<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> friends<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.510> could

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
there's not a lot of friends you could

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.770 
there's not a lot of friends you could
separate<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.289> strands<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.300> right<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.600> you
