machine<00:00:10.620> now<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.519> learned<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.030> lot<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.330> this

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
machine now I learned a lot with this

machine now I learned a lot with this
build<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.960> was<00:00:13.200> not<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> huge<00:00:13.860> success<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.549> did

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730

it<00:00:25.320> out<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.980> pretty<00:00:26.250> cool<00:00:26.460> build

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
it out because it is a pretty cool build

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.080 
it out because it is a pretty cool build
all<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.920> components<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.519> needed<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.970> this

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
all the components I needed for this

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.700 
all the components I needed for this
build<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.570> able<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.900> pick<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> big

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
build I was able to pick up from the big

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.590 
build I was able to pick up from the big
box<00:00:31.949> store<00:00:32.219> well<00:00:32.460> except<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> bubble

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
box store well except for the bubble

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.450 
box store well except for the bubble
solution<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.290> started<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> plastic

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
solution I started with the plastic

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
solution I started with the plastic
container<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.450> could<00:00:36.630> fit<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.989> five-gallon

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
container that I could fit a five-gallon

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.170 
container that I could fit a five-gallon
bucket<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> head<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> cut<00:00:39.000> off

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
bucket in with the head of it cut off

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.139 
bucket in with the head of it cut off
and<00:00:39.480> start<00:00:40.320> carved<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.010> concave<00:00:41.700> section

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and start carved out a concave section

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.630 
and start carved out a concave section
in<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> back<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.050> side<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.829> needed

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
in the back up one side of it I needed

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
in the back up one side of it I needed
to<00:00:44.760> carve<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.480> could<00:00:45.660> fit<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> lazy

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to carve this out so I could fit a lazy

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.160 
to carve this out so I could fit a lazy
susan<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:46.920> later<00:00:47.719> after<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:49.020> done

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
susan in here later after that was done

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
susan in here later after that was done
it<00:00:49.350> drilled<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> small<00:00:49.649> hole<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> spigot

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it drilled a small hole to put a spigot

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
it drilled a small hole to put a spigot
in<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> could<00:00:52.079> drain<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> fluid<00:00:52.800> out

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
in that way I could drain the fluid out

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
in that way I could drain the fluid out
when<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.309> done<00:00:53.489> using<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.969> car<00:00:54.840> when<00:00:55.350> my

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
when I was done using it car when my

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.299 
when I was done using it car when my
daughter<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:56.160> done<00:00:56.370> museum<00:00:57.030> school<00:00:58.309> wasn't

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
daughter was done museum school wasn't

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.189 
daughter was done museum school wasn't
added<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> plastic<00:01:00.090> container<00:01:00.449> called<00:01:00.780> mill

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
added the plastic container called mill

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.740 
added the plastic container called mill
to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> size<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> needed<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.370> built<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.180> half<00:01:03.539> inch

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to the size I needed I built a half inch

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.020 
to the size I needed I built a half inch
plywood<00:01:03.989> frame<00:01:04.439> around<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.309> container<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
plywood frame around this container to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
plywood frame around this container to
kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> keep<00:01:06.900> everything<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> would

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
kind of keep everything in and I would

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
kind of keep everything in and I would
be<00:01:07.950> able<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.189> mount<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.610> components<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
be able to mount some components to this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.219 
be able to mount some components to this
later<00:01:10.729> now<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.970> project<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.810> pretty<00:01:13.020> much<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
later now this project was pretty much a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
later now this project was pretty much a
swag<00:01:13.619> build<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.280> start<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.790> finish<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
swag build from start to finish if you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.240 
swag build from start to finish if you
don't<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.409> swag<00:01:16.619> means<00:01:16.920> its

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
don't know what swag means its

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.210 
don't know what swag means its
scientific<00:01:18.030> wild-ass<00:01:18.659> guess<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.439> really

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
scientific wild-ass guess I really

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
scientific wild-ass guess I really
didn't<00:01:20.490> start<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:20.970> any<00:01:21.090> measurements<00:01:21.960> or

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
didn't start with any measurements or

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.240 
didn't start with any measurements or
drawings<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.950> built<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
drawings I just kind of built it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.300 
drawings I just kind of built it
off-the-cuff<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> after<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> had<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> box

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
off-the-cuff so after I had the box

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.770 
off-the-cuff so after I had the box
built<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.729> needed<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> find<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.360> way<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> mount

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
built I needed to find a way to mount

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
built I needed to find a way to mount
the<00:01:27.990> bucket<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.530> its<00:01:28.710> side<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:29.790> spin<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the bucket on its side so let's spin and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
the bucket on its side so let's spin and
to<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.380> used<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.009> simple<00:01:32.310> lazy

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to do that I just used a simple lazy

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.840 
to do that I just used a simple lazy
susan<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.189> then<00:01:35.189> marked<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.610> where<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
susan and then marked out where the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
it was mounted in the right position

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.810 
it was mounted in the right position
once<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.050> was<00:01:54.200> done<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.710> attached<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.640> half

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
once that was done I attached a half

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.580 
once that was done I attached a half

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
in it as a reference point then I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.780 
in it as a reference point then I
attached<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.750> lazy<00:02:05.930> susan<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.430> box<00:02:07.760> and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
attached the lazy susan to the box and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.150 
attached the lazy susan to the box and

thing I'm using a rotisserie motor they

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.840 
thing I'm using a rotisserie motor they
do<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.780> some<00:02:27.050> high<00:02:27.320> torque<00:02:27.740> low<00:02:28.100> revolution

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
do have some high torque low revolution

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.570 
do have some high torque low revolution
motors<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.840> are<00:02:29.960> battery-powered<00:02:30.410> online<00:02:31.340> I

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
motors that are battery-powered online I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.550 
motors that are battery-powered online I
didn't<00:02:32.180> order<00:02:32.360> one<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.930> definitely<00:02:33.170> go

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
didn't order one and I definitely go

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.400 
didn't order one and I definitely go
order<00:02:33.800> from<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> next<00:02:34.460> belt<00:02:34.750> having<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> 110

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
order from the next belt having a 110

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.840 
order from the next belt having a 110
power<00:02:36.650> next<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.160> something<00:02:37.520> that's<00:02:37.670> got

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
power next to something that's got

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.400 
power next to something that's got
bubble<00:02:38.150> solution<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.750> not<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> greatest

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
bubble solution and not the greatest

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.900 
bubble solution and not the greatest
idea<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> would<00:02:40.100> keep<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.310> really<00:02:40.459> close<00:02:40.550> eye

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
idea so I would keep a really close eye

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.480 
idea so I would keep a really close eye
on<00:02:41.060> my<00:02:41.240> daughter<00:02:41.450> when<00:02:41.720> she's<00:02:42.650> playing<00:02:43.160> with

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
on my daughter when she's playing with

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.290 
on my daughter when she's playing with
it<00:02:44.980> when<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.010> was<00:02:46.220> done<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:46.520> used<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.940> marker

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
it when I was done I just used a marker

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.940 
it when I was done I just used a marker
and<00:02:47.420> Mark<00:02:47.630> out<00:02:47.810> some<00:02:47.990> lines<00:02:48.200> incrementally

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
and Mark out some lines incrementally

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.470 
and Mark out some lines incrementally
about<00:02:49.160> every<00:02:49.400> inch<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> half<00:02:49.880> two<00:02:50.180> inches

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
about every inch and a half two inches

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.750 
about every inch and a half two inches
or<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.110> then<00:02:51.680> some<00:02:51.890> perpendicular<00:02:52.489> lines

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
or so and then some perpendicular lines

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.210 
or so and then some perpendicular lines
as<00:02:52.970> well<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:54.320> these<00:02:54.470> are<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.800> marks<00:02:55.040> where

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
as well and these are just marks where

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.090 
as well and these are just marks where
I'm<00:02:55.310> gonna<00:02:55.459> dress<00:02:55.760> shirts<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.800> took<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
I'm gonna dress shirts so I took the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.920 
I'm gonna dress shirts so I took the
bucket<00:03:01.220> off<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.610> assembly<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.600> started

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
bucket off the assembly and I started

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.020 
bucket off the assembly and I started
drilling<00:03:03.170> holes<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.800> drilled<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.459> lot<00:03:04.730> of

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
drilling holes and I drilled a lot of

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.410 
drilling holes and I drilled a lot of
holes

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
holes

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.880 
holes
I<00:03:05.510> used<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.870> three-quarter<00:03:06.410> inch<00:03:06.440> which<00:03:06.709> is<00:03:06.860> a

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
I used a three-quarter inch which is a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.470 
I used a three-quarter inch which is a
little<00:03:07.340> bit<00:03:07.489> larger<00:03:08.000> than<00:03:08.030> your<00:03:08.330> average

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
little bit larger than your average

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.410 
little bit larger than your average
bubble<00:03:09.290> blower<00:03:09.590> thingy<00:03:10.190> I'm<00:03:10.760> hoping<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.330> my

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
bubble blower thingy I'm hoping that my

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.330 
bubble blower thingy I'm hoping that my
bubbles<00:03:11.720> would<00:03:11.810> be<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:11.959> little<00:03:12.170> bigger<00:03:12.340> once

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
bubbles would be a little bigger once

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.490 
bubbles would be a little bigger once
that<00:03:13.519> was<00:03:13.670> done<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.090> used<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.540> piece<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:15.019> drain

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
that was done I used a piece of a drain

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.660 
that was done I used a piece of a drain
pipe<00:03:15.709> this<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.100> actually<00:03:16.400> rain<00:03:16.640> gutter

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
pipe this is actually rain gutter

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.500 
pipe this is actually rain gutter
and<00:03:18.290> cut<00:03:19.290> out<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.770> bunch<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.610> sections<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.300> in

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
and cut out a bunch of sections right in

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.030 
and cut out a bunch of sections right in
line<00:03:21.750> with<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.230> holes<00:03:22.440> where<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.740> bubbles

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
line with the holes where the bubbles

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.640 
line with the holes where the bubbles
where<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> bubbles<00:03:23.760> are<00:03:23.850> going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.060> be<00:03:24.120> been

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
where the bubbles are going to be been

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:33.730 
where the bubbles are going to be been
tapped<00:03:25.650> one<00:03:25.860> end<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.920 

and<00:03:34.280> then<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.490> Montes<00:03:34.850> thing<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.330> described<00:03:35.840> a

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
and then the Montes thing I described a

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.570 
and then the Montes thing I described a
scrap<00:03:36.140> piece<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.350> plywood<00:03:36.620> kind<00:03:37.490> of

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
scrap piece of plywood kind of

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.340 
scrap piece of plywood kind of
guesstimated<00:03:38.210> where<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.510> needed<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.810> go<00:03:38.930> and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
guesstimated where it needed to go and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.530 
guesstimated where it needed to go and
then<00:03:39.890> marked<00:03:40.190> out<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.580> size<00:03:40.790> for<00:03:41.090> an<00:03:41.180> opening

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
then marked out the size for an opening

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.530 
then marked out the size for an opening
and<00:03:41.810> cut<00:03:41.990> it<00:03:42.110> up<00:03:42.260> with<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.700> Skilsaw<00:03:43.700> or<00:03:44.180> up

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
and cut it up with a Skilsaw or up

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.860 
and cut it up with a Skilsaw or up
jigsaw<00:03:46.120> can't<00:03:47.120> even<00:03:47.300> get<00:03:47.420> my<00:03:47.540> tools<00:03:47.750> right

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
jigsaw can't even get my tools right

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:57.230 
jigsaw can't even get my tools right
today

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.540 

so<00:03:57.840> once<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.110> had<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.290> done<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.890> mounted<00:03:59.520> the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
so once I had that done I mounted the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.460 
so once I had that done I mounted the
plywood<00:04:00.090> kind<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.720> right<00:04:00.960> about<00:04:01.170> where<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
plywood kind of right about where I

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.870 
plywood kind of right about where I
needed<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.220> then<00:04:02.790> used<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.670> kind

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
needed it and then used up that is kind

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.030 
needed it and then used up that is kind
of<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.000> reference<00:04:06.180> point<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.960> put<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.740> drain

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
of a reference point so I put the drain

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.130 
of a reference point so I put the drain
pipe<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.430> afterwards<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.660> then<00:04:09.780> move<00:04:09.960> it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
pipe in afterwards and then move it

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.480 
pipe in afterwards and then move it
right<00:04:10.410> into<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.740> position<00:04:11.130> where<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.340> needed

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
right into the position where it needed

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.400 
right into the position where it needed
to<00:04:11.580> be<00:04:11.700> attached<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.900> piece<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.260> plywood

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
to be attached to that piece of plywood

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.200 
to be attached to that piece of plywood
with<00:04:13.770> some<00:04:13.980> screws<00:04:16.820> made<00:04:17.820> sure<00:04:18.000> everything

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
with some screws made sure everything

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.750 
with some screws made sure everything
was<00:04:18.330> working<00:04:18.450> good<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.170> I<00:04:19.350> had<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.770> test<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.190> so

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
was working good and I had to test it so

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.050 
was working good and I had to test it so
I<00:04:20.790> used<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.150> shop<00:04:21.480> vac<00:04:21.750> as<00:04:21.989> an<00:04:22.140> air<00:04:22.410> source<00:04:22.710> and

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
I used my shop vac as an air source and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.460 
I used my shop vac as an air source and
sure<00:04:24.060> enough<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.570> made<00:04:24.780> bubbles<00:04:25.170> now<00:04:25.320> there

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
sure enough it made bubbles now there

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.230 
sure enough it made bubbles now there
weren't<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.830> massive<00:04:26.400> amount<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.760> bubbles<00:04:26.910> like

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
weren't a massive amount of bubbles like

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.760 
weren't a massive amount of bubbles like
I<00:04:27.360> was<00:04:27.480> hoping<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.290> they<00:04:28.440> didn't<00:04:28.650> produce

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
I was hoping for but they didn't produce

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.070 
I was hoping for but they didn't produce
a<00:04:29.040> pretty<00:04:29.280> fair<00:04:29.520> quantity<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.270> them<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.630> of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
a pretty fair quantity of them and of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.870 
a pretty fair quantity of them and of
course<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.560> was<00:04:31.680> more<00:04:32.040> than<00:04:32.190> enough<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.670> keep

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
course it was more than enough to keep

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.720 
course it was more than enough to keep
my<00:04:33.030> daughter<00:04:33.210> happy

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.600 

and<00:04:42.330> now<00:04:42.600> for<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.080> real<00:04:43.410> test<00:04:43.440> got<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.490> make

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
and now for the real test got to make

00:04:44.610 --> 00:05:07.260 
and now for the real test got to make
sure<00:04:44.820> she<00:04:45.060> likes<00:04:45.270> it

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.559 

go<00:05:07.810> get<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:09.460> this<00:05:09.580> bill<00:05:09.910> was<00:05:10.150> not<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> great

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
go get it so this bill was not a great

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.089 
go get it so this bill was not a great
success<00:05:10.990> but<00:05:11.169> I<00:05:11.229> learned<00:05:11.440> a<00:05:11.560> lot<00:05:11.680> about<00:05:11.800> what<00:05:12.069> I

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
success but I learned a lot about what I

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.100 
success but I learned a lot about what I
need<00:05:12.310> to<00:05:12.400> do<00:05:12.490> next<00:05:12.699> time<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.210> I'm<00:05:13.780> definitely

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
need to do next time and I'm definitely

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.809 
need to do next time and I'm definitely
going<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.740> build<00:05:14.889> another<00:05:15.039> one<00:05:15.400> one<00:05:15.639> that

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
going to build another one one that

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.069 
going to build another one one that
produces<00:05:16.300> a<00:05:16.330> massive<00:05:16.930> quantity<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.680> bubbles
