00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of stone it is it is a soaking stone but

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.889 
of stone it is it is a soaking stone but
it<00:00:35.340> doesn't<00:00:35.550> require<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.850> long<00:00:36.180> soak<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.809> be

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it doesn't require a long soak it can be

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.150 
it doesn't require a long soak it can be
soaked<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> couple<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.040> minutes

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
soaked for just a couple of minutes

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
soaked for just a couple of minutes
maybe<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.120> five<00:00:39.360> minutes<00:00:39.690> before<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.960> use

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it it soaks very quickly and everything

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.910
