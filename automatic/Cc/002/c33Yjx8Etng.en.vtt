00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hey people welcome to my 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.560
 yes i would say sorry video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.019
 just because we may have noticed 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 there was no video this week 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.070
 that's because of him on twitter 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.410
 follows then you know that english all 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.270
 but if not explained but in this 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.539
 he puts it on us that we have this video 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.359
 week 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.859
 the teachers thought so we courage 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.420
 have only next week school 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.820
 that means we have to go 80 again 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.050
 write millions of work and still 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.780
 a lecture there and still exactly 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.700
 and that was a bit stressful though 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.660
 I am fortunately on thursday after 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 were sent home 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.620
 Dennis went bad and that's me 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.329
 Thursday had to be the class work 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.200
 Do not write with me but I have to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.520
 to write from therefore it does not matter 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 yes again big sorry to you from me 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.449
 that this week no video came in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 background you see just like me 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 a room has a bit 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.180
 custom content will fall the eyes and the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.289
 hairstyles in any case box content 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.690
 otherwise have been, I believe I still 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.590
 a small market box could be used 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.140
 but otherwise is not so important now 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.729
 I really want it all day now 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.869
 so at home thinking now might be 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.369
 I do not think so, as you do 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.320
 if you are sick, yes, because I feel 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 Not to take me up like that now 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.650
 just wanted to make this video fast 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.750
 and actually I have to go for it too 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.729
 Nicos live but that shifts 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.799
 I hope that all that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.509
 do that on sunday at seven 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.250
 types of youtube a video can come 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.750
 with bar where we just nice at nico 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.280
 if you give me as not yet available 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.970
 bz if I have not subscribed there yet 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.070
 then do that because it came last 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.350
 sunday a video and a bravo 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.770
 doctor summer analysis where i ask the questions 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.170
 from the doctor summer your questions 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.560
 answered 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.299
 that's okay, that was pretty 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.860
 funny and that has me too 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.710
 positive reviews I quickly that 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.330
 We will be over 50 within 24 hours 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.680
 Thumbs up and now almost 70 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.439
 Thumbs up that is really blatant 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.149
 if you wanted to stop by that 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.580
 video is linked here as well as the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.410
 channel is also linked in the video and 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.810
 if you are on the phone then everything is in 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.569
 of the description and of course in the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.340
 comments as always then twitter 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.840
 can you tell me yes as I said yes 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.980
 The people told me earlier 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.360
 Actually, on twitter you have to follow 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.550
 mostly how I feel or what actually 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.220
 is therefore if not a twitter off 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.459
 then it does you best no 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.950
 I think Twitter is really cool 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.239
 and since each is each of their response 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.920
 So there you can with everyone 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.610
 communicate and it makes it easy 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.880
 that's why I do not know 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.260
 am 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.700
 facebook is just shit 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.299
 and twitters just do it 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.819
 huge fun 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.340
 so if you followed me and that's me 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.780
 also a usual 30 at night run 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.840
 laying down the course 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.370
 description also instagram can 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.600
 you also cover but that's not the case 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.370
 important because the post is not every day 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.560
 a picture but if so pictures of me 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.040
 check instagram from 30 et 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.450
 nikos live and so underlined johanna 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.120
 as addressed I am sorry that 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.489
 no videos came then two channel again 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.670
 addressed twitter and instagram and 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.850
 On the other hand, nobody links to facebook 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:19.010
 on it now and again now 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:23.120
 videos come i think fish 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.290
 memorial saturday sunday I could 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.810
 well imagine that on the two days 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.280
 a video is coming and that i hope so 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.750
 that on sunday sharp with simon of 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.670
 youtube I already have one 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.900
 cool idea at least to a youtuber 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.730
 that will be really funny for exactly what 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.069
 now for this video i hope you 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.230
 can forgive me but school goes 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.540
 stop in front 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.560
 but I'll try it hard next 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.560
 week again videos come 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.390
 hopefully at least every two days 1 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.980
 best of course every day but one 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.730
 every 2 days 1 is actually mine 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.459
 so target people so we either listen 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.290
 on circuit boards or you get now 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.239
 on nikolai from shield there like that 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.150
 bit and looks you from what is 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.099
 because I have done so I think that's real 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.769
 funny so draws in any case 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.299
 in and maybe subscribe yet 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:22.760
 I do not care what you do there , we do 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.690
 hear only on saturday or sunday and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.300
 I'm still a bit further now 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.510
 iloveradio because I love iloveradio.de 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.520
 you are still doing it now 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.020
 product placement for iloveradio well 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.150
 no matter it cola anyway because he 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.800
 Really on youtube music but no matter 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.880
 check it off of course it is synonymous 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.080
 everything is a video description 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.520
 No money for that 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.050
 we hear how many times we hear each other 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.800
 belong to us and hear us hear something like that 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.800
 nothing more
