00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.970 
this u-shape and if you want on what's
on<00:01:27.910> my<00:01:28.000> tracks<00:01:28.300> I<00:01:28.540> did<00:01:28.870> similar<00:01:29.170> sound<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.740> video

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
video but like I was like what you don't

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.860 
video but like I was like what you don't
have<00:05:07.700> to<00:05:07.850> cut<00:05:08.060> your<00:05:08.210> hair<00:05:08.390> if<00:05:08.479> you<00:05:08.539> don't<00:05:08.690> want

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
tracks but this probably will only work

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.420

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.950 
the curls are made like instead of it
being<00:05:40.340> like<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.640> normal<00:05:41.000> curl<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:41.539> more<00:05:41.810> of<00:05:41.870> a

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
being like a normal curl it's more of a

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.930 
being like a normal curl it's more of a
loose<00:05:42.380> wave<00:05:42.650> at<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:42.860> top<00:05:43.100> and<00:05:43.400> needs<00:05:43.580> really

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
loose wave at the top and needs really

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.790 
loose wave at the top and needs really
tight<00:05:44.330> curl<00:05:44.539> the<00:05:44.720> ends<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:45.440> it<00:05:45.530> can't<00:05:45.710> make

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
tight curl the ends and it can't make

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.200 
tight curl the ends and it can't make
the<00:05:45.950> ends<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.220> little<00:05:46.280> bit<00:05:46.400> straggly<00:05:47.000> if<00:05:47.120> you

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
the ends a little bit straggly if you

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.460 
the ends a little bit straggly if you
don't<00:05:47.390> have<00:05:47.510> enough<00:05:47.690> hair<00:05:47.900> so<00:05:48.200> I<00:05:48.229> would

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
don't have enough hair so I would

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.750 
don't have enough hair so I would
definitely<00:05:48.530> say<00:05:48.770> four<00:05:49.100> bundles<00:05:49.310> for<00:05:49.640> this

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
definitely say four bundles for this

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.570 
definitely say four bundles for this
hair<00:05:49.940> texture<00:05:50.590> but<00:05:51.590> if<00:05:51.710> you<00:05:51.830> use<00:05:51.979> longer<00:05:52.340> hair

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
hair texture but if you use longer hair

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.240 
hair texture but if you use longer hair
like<00:05:53.060> all<00:05:53.270> eight<00:05:53.450> inches<00:05:53.750> versus<00:05:54.169> must<00:05:54.919> a

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
like all eight inches versus must a

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.010 
like all eight inches versus must a
great<00:05:55.490> lengths<00:05:55.729> I<00:05:55.850> did<00:05:56.090> it<00:05:56.600> probably<00:05:56.780> you

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
great lengths I did it probably you

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.650 
great lengths I did it probably you
probably<00:05:57.229> get<00:05:57.410> away<00:05:57.530> with<00:05:57.650> three<00:05:57.770> bundles

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
probably get away with three bundles

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.930 
probably get away with three bundles
so<00:06:00.530> yeah<00:06:00.650> that<00:06:00.830> is<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:00.980> hair<00:06:01.280> so<00:06:01.490> far<00:06:01.730> I
