00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.510
 we had encountered a problem for Hope of this type of electrical 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.459
 Lammerts with the guy 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.459
 p what to bite then it applies to all Case 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.099
 Witness order 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.890
 our tip selector at type Selector 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.980
 Give her shepherd selector with Johnson Case h1 resin pro or whatever 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.789
 then go with the declaration 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.849
 the VP which value 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.749
 this is our tip selector 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.010
 in case of complaints properties the currency 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.920
 in html-file is subsequently lead type Electron 1 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.330
 fed the clothes 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.980
 because value 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.920
 Zattoo Demann will believe in business and that's what and so far 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.370
 got to know when tips Elektro 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 now comes to this problem way to get that all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.510
 do the same 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.340
 he can be through that one never gets anywhere 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.149
 André 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.429
 they are short consume André Frauchiger happy customer else what 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.930
 Classes Selleck are doing their bit 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.500
 So get away from the direct bind units ELTEC 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 and defines class coffers 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.230
 the corresponding html z you have to show the class then but 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.340
 Main bank that he meant because for paper told all PST al-erian Solvay 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.390
 Percent with shots, whatever 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.470
 Now you have to say that in addition 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 Tec is one of the class sounds 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.700
 that means 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.190
 html area 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.800
 Woman to raise another attribute 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.030
 this attribute with the attributes Evening Las 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.030
 until equal and then counter name of the class 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.370
 as me here 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.600
 Knut Klaßen 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.520
 for editors 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.350
 ZAD in another 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.070
 around the attribute called glass is equal and then the unique name 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.450
 in the area of ​​CSS 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.180
 I give this unique name to her example of buying the 1 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.400
 in addition fall way 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.100
 shown here in red muses point 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.129
 clear in CSS 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.129
 this is probably the class 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.699
 So the settings are sad 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.779
 against Harmo's reminder rest again taste the clothes again 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.779
 Putin had stopped value attribute 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.269
 Pune front differs they are very serres where box names starts 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.139
 from Regressen point 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.269
 and in html times clear to the same and in their own name 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.749
 Advantage of these classes for editors is 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.749
 that regardless of hard everyday life 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.139
 where can 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.219
 clearest different source text had to travel 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.239
 as an an example 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.179
 bwin gives him the color 1 the jumper puts yellow 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:54.619
 I can say that wonderful I want to have exactly this formula 1 because of h1 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.889
 So I know this hype class v4 1 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.220
 and investigator has in the file I also say wonderful means Torun 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.180
 so offering the same color so i know the class on this jump 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.869
 v4 1 too 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.339
 so now have both 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.419
 be mine this color 1 Uni Mainz ISS 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:15.569
 document 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.569
 Pauli only once find this color 1d 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.669
 So could Stolten place pretty much 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.349
 for comparison standards 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.149
 some Laumann were very good 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.709
 compare 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.429
 here type was last but that ends soon in data a district stands h-1 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.099
 Travel 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.559
 in the CS first part 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.709
 will Selecao about this guy 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.059
 referred to 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.239
 Glass of what should do so 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.400
 then give class target currently stands in Doha 2 percent 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.349
 the extension 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.699
 Attributes Claas is the same timpani 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.480
 because you have to give a clear name of Niederzier Sastre part 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.239
 given 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.469
 here are dots and the unique name and then the definition 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.319
 behind it 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.419
 I did not have a bit more freedom with turbo world 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.629
 ready for testing 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.479
 here's an example 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.969
 we have your paragraph here within this paragraph 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.189
 at the 2 there rich 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.189
 Diez Schoen Poffo have been raised 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.969
 these two areas are different 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.939
 not by logically simmering table textures 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.400
 at the singles Bronner Podium 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.620
 rather 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.159
 by avoiding the attributes 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.830
 two different classes have been given 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.439
 the case the classes village on the 1st 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.749
 was considered a background 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.599
 in the case the class has the second class the Roth as background 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.529
 tried one but tried with 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.740
 the north can map that 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.539
 that is the 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.050
 beautiful introduction to classes
