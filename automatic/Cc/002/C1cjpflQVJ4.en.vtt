00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
one I've got here these mixers are fully

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.839 
one I've got here these mixers are fully
integrated<00:00:24.750> with<00:00:25.350> Serato<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.310> don't<00:00:26.519> need<00:00:26.699> an

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
integrated with Serato you don't need an

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
integrated with Serato you don't need an
external<00:00:27.210> box<00:00:27.689> that's<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.230> mixer<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:28.800> at

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
external box that's your mixer but at

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
the cool thing is that you can now

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.579 
the cool thing is that you can now
retouch<00:04:57.819> the<00:04:58.059> waveform<00:04:58.599> exactly<00:04:59.229> in<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.379> same

00:04:59.579 --> 00:04:59.589 
retouch the waveform exactly in the same

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:01.229 
retouch the waveform exactly in the same
manner<00:04:59.889> you<00:05:00.009> would<00:05:00.339> in<00:05:00.549> Ableton<00:05:00.879> Live<00:05:00.999> you<00:05:01.149> so

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:01.239 
manner you would in Ableton Live you so

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:03.119 
manner you would in Ableton Live you so
you<00:05:01.329> can<00:05:01.479> select<00:05:01.749> and<00:05:02.199> this<00:05:02.409> associate<00:05:02.979> the

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
you can select and this associate the

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.129 
you can select and this associate the
waveform<00:05:03.639> you<00:05:03.759> can<00:05:03.909> repeat<00:05:04.419> part<00:05:04.749> of<00:05:04.899> it<00:05:05.019> you

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
waveform you can repeat part of it you

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.719 
waveform you can repeat part of it you
can<00:05:05.199> move<00:05:05.529> the<00:05:05.709> whole<00:05:05.829> thing<00:05:06.189> if<00:05:06.339> your<00:05:06.489> mix

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
can move the whole thing if your mix

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.119 
can move the whole thing if your mix
wasn't<00:05:07.149> at<00:05:07.269> the<00:05:07.299> right<00:05:07.569> place<00:05:07.989> now<00:05:08.889> it's<00:05:09.039> a

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
wasn't at the right place now it's a

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.859 
wasn't at the right place now it's a
great<00:05:09.429> tool<00:05:09.789> you<00:05:09.999> can<00:05:10.179> collapse<00:05:10.569> all<00:05:10.779> the

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:10.869 
great tool you can collapse all the

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:13.529 
great tool you can collapse all the

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.089 
here you will find in your master track
you<00:05:16.689> will<00:05:16.809> find<00:05:17.169> your<00:05:17.379> cross<00:05:17.769> fader

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
you will find your cross fader

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.129 
you will find your cross fader
