00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
some of them for PvE the first one is I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.190 
some of them for PvE the first one is I
don't<00:02:23.459> control<00:02:23.730> panel<00:02:24.120> what<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.990> basically

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
don't control panel what that basically

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.880 
don't control panel what that basically
is<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:26.700> puts<00:02:27.390> our<00:02:27.540> button<00:02:27.930> called<00:02:28.410> add-ons<00:02:28.680> in

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
is it puts our button called add-ons in

your game menu in between key bindings
and<00:02:31.950> macros<00:02:32.810> which<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.989> reckon<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.319> really

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
and macros which I reckon is really

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.280 
and macros which I reckon is really
useful<00:02:34.920> because<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:36.270> activate<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:36.870> disable

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
useful because to activate or disable

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.449 
useful because to activate or disable

is<00:03:43.530> number<00:03:43.680> four<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:45.420> basically<00:03:45.780> my<00:03:45.989> UI

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
is number four it it's basically my UI

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.900 
is number four it it's basically my UI
at<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.590> moment<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.070> keeps<00:03:47.310> in<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.489> nice<00:03:47.670> small

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
at the moment it keeps in a nice small

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.240 
at the moment it keeps in a nice small
box<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.510> know<00:03:49.350> where<00:03:49.500> everything<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:49.950> because

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
box I know where everything is because

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.620 
box I know where everything is because
it's<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.519> everything's<00:03:50.910> keep<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.359> for<00:03:51.510> me

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
so I don't really need to know where

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.349 
so I don't really need to know where
everything<00:03:53.579> is<00:03:53.700> because<00:03:53.910> I'm<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.180> click

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
red area you can move and it can just

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.610 
red area you can move and it can just
cast<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.400> because<00:06:08.700> if<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.810> bar<00:06:10.140> works<00:06:10.440> with

you know

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.100 
you know
well<00:06:42.970> whatever<00:06:43.150> color<00:06:43.450> you<00:06:43.600> want<00:06:43.750> you<00:06:43.960> can

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
well whatever color you want you can

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.440 
well whatever color you want you can
customize<00:06:44.350> it<00:06:44.770> 100%<00:06:45.430> and<00:06:45.670> I<00:06:45.880> reckon<00:06:46.150> this<00:06:46.420> is

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
customize it 100% and I reckon this is
