school baseball program changeup and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.630 
school baseball program changeup and
Longoria<00:00:18.300> strikes<00:00:18.539> out<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
Longoria strikes out so you have to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.099 
Longoria strikes out so you have to
establish<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:21.990> to

establish that and I think you have to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.259 
establish that and I think you have to
put<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.590> mind<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.980> those<00:00:23.130> hitters<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
put it in the mind of those hitters and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.140 
put it in the mind of those hitters and
does<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> against<00:00:25.140> ball<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.070> away

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
