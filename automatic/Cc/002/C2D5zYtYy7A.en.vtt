to<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.769> boil<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.220> then<00:02:56.380> I'll<00:02:57.380> cool<00:02:57.950> down<00:02:57.980> a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
to the boil and then I'll cool down a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.680 
to the boil and then I'll cool down a
little<00:02:58.400> bit<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.849> skins<00:02:59.120> come<00:02:59.329> off<00:02:59.450> nice

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
little bit and the skins come off nice

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.380 
little bit and the skins come off nice
and<00:02:59.720> easy<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:01.280> tough<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:01.910> wanted<00:03:02.269> to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
and easy that's tough and then wanted to

and easy that's tough and then wanted to
do<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:02.660> is<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:02.870> sterilize<00:03:03.739> my<00:03:04.160> already

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
too particular for cheese so I should be

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.870 
too particular for cheese so I should be
back<00:03:40.819> in<00:03:40.880> move<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:42.430> okay<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.609> is<00:03:43.730> interesting

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
back in move it okay this is interesting

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.660 
film in our meal or bobs big group all
that's<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.600> focus<00:03:51.010> on<00:03:52.010> what<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.310> should<00:03:52.459> see

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
that's in focus on what you should see

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.199 
that's in focus on what you should see
is<00:03:52.880> where<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.959> got<00:03:54.139> skins<00:03:55.569> just<00:03:56.569> peel<00:03:56.900> off

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
is where you got skins just peel off

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.720 
is where you got skins just peel off
nice<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.450> easy<00:03:59.750> Oh

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.800 

so<00:04:04.360> what<00:04:04.510> we're<00:04:04.629> doing<00:04:04.659> that<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.510> can<00:04:07.629> see

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
so what we're doing that and you can see

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.339 
so what we're doing that and you can see
why<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:09.840> orbitals<00:04:10.840> are<00:04:10.989> essential<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:14.049> just

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
why the orbitals are essential so just

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.590 
why the orbitals are essential so just
do<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.590> with<00:04:14.739> all<00:04:14.830> he<00:04:14.920> beats<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:19.299> can<00:04:19.449> see

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
do that with all he beats you can see

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.180 
do that with all he beats you can see
pull<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.019> end<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.350> cylinder<00:04:20.530> just<00:04:21.040> the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
pull the end of the cylinder just the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.580 
pull the end of the cylinder just the
root<00:04:21.370> wad<00:04:21.970> left<00:04:22.240> on<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.479> they<00:04:22.750> just<00:04:22.960> they<00:04:23.560> just

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
root wad left on it they just they just

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.030 
root wad left on it they just they just
pull<00:04:23.919> off<00:04:23.979> at<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.220> skin<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:25.570> then<00:04:26.410> what's

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
pull off at the skin and then what's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.590 
pull off at the skin and then what's
happened<00:04:27.430> what<00:04:27.610> we<00:04:27.729> snaps<00:04:28.030> off<00:04:28.270> instead<00:04:28.540> of

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
happened what we snaps off instead of

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.890 
happened what we snaps off instead of
quite<00:04:28.840> enough<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.199> stop<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.560> bleeding<00:04:29.770> well

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
quite enough to stop and bleeding well

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.909 
quite enough to stop and bleeding well
on<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.050> slice<00:04:32.260> that<00:04:32.470> what<00:04:32.560> kind<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:33.270> nicely
