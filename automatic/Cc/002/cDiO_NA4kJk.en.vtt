00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.770 
notice it's a practice in my video it's
really<00:01:17.940> because<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.690> I'm

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
really because I don't know what I'm

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
really because I don't know what I'm
doing<00:01:19.050> with<00:01:19.140> my<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.500> hand<00:01:19.580> most<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
doing with my right hand most of the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.469 
doing with my right hand most of the
time<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.660> just<00:01:22.050> kind<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.470> feel<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.180> flows

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
time I just kind of feel it as it flows

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.980 
time I just kind of feel it as it flows
all<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.400> intro<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.660> gonna<00:01:27.810> put
