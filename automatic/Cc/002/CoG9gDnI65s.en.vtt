 watch this video just do not see it and 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.560
 Ok, let's begin 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.319
 and everything happens in the year of 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.930
 2007 I was 5 years old I did not know 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.880
 transformers and when I saw the trailer for 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.220
 the movie and the truth did not appeal to me 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.920
 a lot but when we went to see her 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.260
 I thrill so much good I was 5 years old 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.140
 tastes changed and I really liked the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.270
 movie for the epic fights and everything 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.580
 that's so after a few days my 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.010
 cousin got a game of transformers 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.830
 and it was not from the movie but it was from 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.440
 transformers best wars and I liked it a lot 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.230
 the game I recommend them a lot 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.570
 but back to the subject the game I liked 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.060
 a lot so I decided to investigate more 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.340
 about this game and I got the quality 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.130
 that it was a series and I saw a few 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.080
 episodes and I liked them a lot and 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.420
 days later my cousin bought a 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.940
 I put Transformers movie 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.820
 quickly and it was a movie of does 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.460
 a lot and it was from generation 1 before 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.710
 I understood him but I saw her many times and 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.260
 I was understanding little by little in that 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.720
 movie I met many characters like 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.970
 the dyes not bots iun and chrome galba 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.970
 throne we gave it prime and so on 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.030
 but in 2009 I was 7 years old 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.700
 when came out transformers 2 revenge 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.099
 of the fallen 'and I must say it was the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.709
 better than the first I liked it a lot 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.900
 I always saw her without stopping that movie 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.510
 gave me unexpected things like the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.030
 Resuscitation Megatron's death 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.400
 optimus prime the new prime armor 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.799
 I also liked the fights and 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.780
 battles I never got tired of seeing that 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.330
 movie although I must say that the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.739
 twins towards watching the movie silly but 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.739
 I still liked it a lot 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.420
 after a while, transformers came out 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.060
 animated I saw one of his episodes and it was 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.790
 the biggest crap was a loss of 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.340
 time did not have a good story ever 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.380
 I was watching one of his episodes again 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.170
 series takes the gold medal in the 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.120
 worst cartoon in the world the worst I saw 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.070
 in my life I had already ruined 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.920
 good transformers not 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.620
 Transformers I still liked just 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.720
 that sometimes I was watching episodes and 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.270
 it was the most subnormal idea that I have 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.040
 happened and I did not see it that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.040
 series that is that they took it 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.610
 then came 2011 I had nine 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.250
 years when it came out transformers 3 the side 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.860
 dark of the moon and that was better than 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.110
 the other two I never tire of seeing her 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.720
 that was the first movie that made me 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.940
 mourn when the autobots left and 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.770
 they destroyed that movie was my 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.780
 favorite never my fed up 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.090
 impress me when the autobots 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.990
 they appeared and we thought they were 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.270
 destroyed 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.340
 I never got tired of the battle at the end 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.650
 I moved from the emotion and 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.789
 despair and I still do not get tired of seeing 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.789
 that wonderful movie 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.470

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.810

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.810
