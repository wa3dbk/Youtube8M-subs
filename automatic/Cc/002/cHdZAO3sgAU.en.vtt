00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.589
 the Sangiovese is a lump the red berry 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.769
 the berry is made up of the peel and the pulp 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.099
 the skin contains the anthocyanins that give color to the wine 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.099
 and tannins that will give the future structure 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460
 inside the pulp 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.380
 consisting of sugar waters 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.440
 it is colorless 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.860
 always to make red wine 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.020
 draw the skins with the must 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.490
 the hey hand-picked, destemmed grape is placed inside the vats of 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.820
 fermentation 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.060
 that once they were made of wood and now they are steel 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.450
 inside these the must is positioned the lower part and the skins 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.910
 at the top 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 and go to form the hat 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.800
 to get a red wine you have to mix 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.390
 the must with the skins 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.080
 once this was done by hand 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.170
 through the use of the pole 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.300
 currently in our cellar for young wines 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.490
 we use 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.350
 a very modern dedication system called ganymede carbon dioxide 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.899
 naturally produced during fermentation it pushes the must towards 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:28.570
 up 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.880
 breaks the hat by putting the skins in contact with the must 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.440
 the wine oxidizes in the presence of oxygen 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.480
 and this may be at fault 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.000
 to overcome this problem, sulphites are used in wine 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.580
 the ganymede method works in the absence of oxygen 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.080
 this allows us to use - sulphites in the production of our wines e 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.320
 then obtain that perini natural products for long aging and then 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.940
 intended for reserves we use tiny to wider sections where the contact 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.550
 the must is higher between the skins 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
 this favors the extraction of anthocyanins edit years 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.280
 to help break the hat in this case we use systems 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.940
 traditional
