 good this game I played it in my psp 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.049
 but since they stole it from me, I did not have 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.080
 how to play it but now I can play it 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.930
 in my mobile more comfortably the game 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.810
 weighs approximately 600 megabytes 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.510
 and then the game will run depending 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.420
 of the mobile phone that you have for example in my 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.700
