that we're actually using our one core
inflation<00:00:30.410> technology<00:00:31.219> this<00:00:31.579> allows<00:00:31.880> us<00:00:31.910> to

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
inflation technology this allows us to

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.959 
inflation technology this allows us to
use<00:00:32.630> one<00:00:32.960> single<00:00:33.380> valve<00:00:33.770> on<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.579> side<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.789> the

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
use one single valve on the side of the

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.910 
use one single valve on the side of the
tent<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.629> when<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.170> pump<00:00:36.350> is<00:00:36.500> plugged<00:00:36.739> into

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
tent and when the pump is plugged into

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.369 
tent and when the pump is plugged into
here<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.640> can<00:00:37.760> actually<00:00:37.910> inflate<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:39.019> entire

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
here you can actually inflate the entire

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.669 
here you can actually inflate the entire
thing<00:00:39.739> using<00:00:40.219> justice<00:00:40.579> one<00:00:40.820> valve<00:00:41.589> when<00:00:42.589> it

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
thing using justice one valve when it

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.729 
thing using justice one valve when it
comes<00:00:42.859> to<00:00:42.980> deflate<00:00:43.339> in<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.609> tent<00:00:43.820> each<00:00:44.300> and

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
comes to deflate in the tent each and

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.649 
comes to deflate in the tent each and
tube<00:00:45.739> section<00:00:46.160> has<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.699> release<00:00:47.149> valve<00:00:47.359> like

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
tube section has a release valve like

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.479 
tube section has a release valve like
this<00:00:47.839> one<00:00:48.019> here<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:48.710> all<00:00:48.800> we<00:00:48.890> have<00:00:49.039> to<00:00:49.159> do<00:00:49.280> is

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
this one here so all we have to do is

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.520 
this one here so all we have to do is
just<00:00:49.699> turn<00:00:50.149> this<00:00:50.300> round<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:51.079> tent<00:00:51.289> will

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
just turn this round and the tent will

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.880 
just turn this round and the tent will
deflate<00:00:51.890> really<00:00:52.460> quickly<00:00:52.789> as<00:00:52.969> well<00:00:53.559> we<00:00:54.559> supply

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
deflate really quickly as well we supply

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.739 
deflate really quickly as well we supply
a<00:00:54.920> double<00:00:55.370> action<00:00:55.519> hand<00:00:55.879> pump<00:00:56.120> with<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.539> tent

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
a double action hand pump with the tent

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.360 
a double action hand pump with the tent
and<00:00:56.989> you'll<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:57.289> see<00:00:57.409> on<00:00:57.559> top<00:00:57.769> here<00:00:58.010> that<00:00:58.280> we

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
and you'll just see on top here that we

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.470 
and you'll just see on top here that we
have<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.760> manometer

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
have a manometer

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.380 
have a manometer
which<00:01:00.079> just<00:01:00.409> indicates<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.100> pressure<00:01:01.339> of<00:01:01.879> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
which just indicates the pressure of the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.750 
which just indicates the pressure of the
inflatable<00:01:03.050> tubes<00:01:03.319> now<00:01:04.129> this<00:01:04.280> tent<00:01:04.519> can<00:01:04.670> be

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
one of these windows has been tinted so

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.869 
one of these windows has been tinted so
it<00:02:08.479> serves<00:02:08.780> two<00:02:08.959> key<00:02:09.200> functions<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
it serves two key functions one is to

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.640 
it serves two key functions one is to
reflect<00:02:11.239> away<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.719> sunlight<00:02:12.079> reducing<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
reflect away the sunlight reducing the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.380 
reflect away the sunlight reducing the
amount<00:02:12.859> of<00:02:12.950> glare<00:02:13.249> and<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.849> second<00:02:14.269> is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
amount of glare and the second is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.520 
amount of glare and the second is
obviously<00:02:14.689> to<00:02:14.930> give<00:02:15.079> you<00:02:15.170> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
obviously to give you that

obviously to give you that
more<00:02:15.830> privacy<00:02:16.160> within<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> tent<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.060> well<00:02:17.620> we

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
more privacy within the tent as well we

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.500 
more privacy within the tent as well we
also<00:02:18.770> have<00:02:18.890> our<00:02:19.310> floating<00:02:19.580> Guylaine<00:02:20.060> system

also have our floating Guylaine system
on<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.959> tent<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.340> where<00:02:22.490> we<00:02:22.610> have

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
on this tent so this is where we have

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.760

two<00:02:23.030> separate<00:02:23.480> sections<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> Guylaine<00:02:24.530> so

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
two separate sections to the Guylaine so

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.650 
two separate sections to the Guylaine so

we have the black Guylaine at the top
which<00:02:26.870> obviously<00:02:27.110> ties<00:02:27.410> in<00:02:27.590> with<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.830> color

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
which obviously ties in with the color

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.980 
which obviously ties in with the color
of<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.310> tent<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:29.270> at<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> bottom<00:02:29.630> we

tent is our easy pegging system so it's

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.199 
tent is our easy pegging system so it's
where<00:02:51.860> we<00:02:51.980> supply<00:02:52.280> three<00:02:52.610> different<00:02:52.970> pegs

where we supply three different pegs

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.210 
where we supply three different pegs
with<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> tent<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.050> we<00:02:54.080> have<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.500> solid<00:02:55.040> steel

with the tent so we have the solid steel
pegs<00:02:55.550> here<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:56.120> use<00:02:56.239> on<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.630> corners<00:02:57.050> where

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
the gray pegging points are so these

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.080 
the gray pegging points are so these
become<00:02:59.930> your<00:02:59.959> anchor<00:03:00.380> pegs<00:03:00.650> we<00:03:01.550> have<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.930 
pegging system ensures you get the right
peg<00:03:14.360> in<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.750> right<00:03:14.900> place<00:03:15.430> you'll<00:03:16.430> find<00:03:16.489> that

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
peg in the right place you'll find that

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.220 
peg in the right place you'll find that
on<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.090> side<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.569> tent<00:03:17.780> we<00:03:17.900> have<00:03:18.050> this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
on the side of the tent we have this

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.770 
on the side of the tent we have this
rain<00:03:18.560> safe<00:03:18.830> entrance<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.880> on<00:03:20.150> drizzly<00:03:20.570> days

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
rain safe entrance so on drizzly days

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.630 
rain safe entrance so on drizzly days
this<00:03:21.170> would<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.680> entrance<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.100> use<00:03:22.340> and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
this would be the entrance to use and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.610 
this would be the entrance to use and
obviously<00:03:22.940> you'll<00:03:23.120> get<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.510> good<00:03:23.930> amount<00:03:24.470> of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
obviously you'll get a good amount of

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.100 
obviously you'll get a good amount of
shelter<00:03:25.040> over<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.519> door<00:03:25.730> here<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:26.989> can

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
shelter over the door here so you can

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.479 
shelter over the door here so you can
see<00:03:27.260> here<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.650> front<00:03:27.860> door<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.250> tent

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
see here that the front door on the tent

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.670 
see here that the front door on the tent
is<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.970> good<00:03:29.239> size<00:03:29.480> certainly<00:03:29.750> fill<00:03:30.200> walk-in

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
is a good size certainly fill walk-in

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.140 
is a good size certainly fill walk-in
hate<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.100> it's<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.280> good<00:03:31.459> width<00:03:31.640> as<00:03:31.820> well<00:03:32.000> to

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
hate and it's a good width as well to

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.310 
hate and it's a good width as well to
enable<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.510> get<00:03:32.750> your<00:03:32.900> furniture<00:03:33.290> and

storage<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.950> things<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.370> inside<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
storage and things like this inside the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.970 
storage and things like this inside the
tent<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.420> mentioned<00:03:36.200> earlier<00:03:36.440> on<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.739> we<00:03:36.799> use

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
tent I mentioned earlier on that we use

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.580 
tent I mentioned earlier on that we use
our<00:03:37.220> one<00:03:37.489> goal<00:03:37.810> inflation<00:03:38.810> technology<00:03:39.350> in

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
our one goal inflation technology in

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.920 
our one goal inflation technology in
this<00:03:39.769> tent<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.190> how<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.850> works<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.510> by<00:03:41.690> using

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
this tent and how that works is by using

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.170 
this tent and how that works is by using
these<00:03:42.170> long<00:03:42.680> tube<00:03:43.160> sections<00:03:43.610> which<00:03:43.820> ones<00:03:44.060> in

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
these long tube sections which ones in

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.819 
these long tube sections which ones in
the<00:03:44.299> middle<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.690> tent<00:03:44.900> from<00:03:45.500> front<00:03:45.769> to

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
the middle of the tent from front to

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.470 
the middle of the tent from front to
back<00:03:45.950> what<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.459> actually<00:03:46.940> does<00:03:46.970> as<00:03:47.269> well

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
back what that actually does as well

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.900 
back what that actually does as well
this<00:03:47.900> creates<00:03:48.290> even<00:03:48.739> more<00:03:48.769> stability<00:03:49.250> on<00:03:49.459> here

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
this creates even more stability on here

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.729 
this creates even more stability on here
so<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.150> can<00:03:50.269> see<00:03:50.420> here<00:03:50.630> even<00:03:50.780> by<00:03:51.019> me<00:03:51.230> putting

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
so you can see here even by me putting

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:52.960 
so you can see here even by me putting
quite<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> lot<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.280> pressure<00:03:52.459> on<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.760> front

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
quite a lot of pressure on the front

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.550 
quite a lot of pressure on the front
there<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.269> tent<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.600> very<00:03:53.810> very<00:03:54.079> stable<00:03:54.350> so

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
there the tent is very very stable so

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.750 
there the tent is very very stable so
that<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:54.890> shows<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.310> even<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.609> high

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
that just shows you that even in high

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.460 
that just shows you that even in high
wind<00:03:56.000> conditions<00:03:56.450> you're<00:03:57.079> still<00:03:57.260> gonna<00:03:57.380> be

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
wind conditions you're still gonna be

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.490 
wind conditions you're still gonna be
able<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.769> use<00:03:58.519> it<00:03:58.700> in<00:03:59.019> something<00:04:00.019> else<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.320> just

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
able to use it in something else I just

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.860 
able to use it in something else I just
want<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.709> point<00:04:00.859> out<00:04:01.040> on<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.730> tube<00:04:02.480> sections

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
want to point out on the tube sections

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.990 
want to point out on the tube sections
themselves<00:04:03.380> is<00:04:03.530> are<00:04:03.859> shot<00:04:04.190> off<00:04:04.370> valves<00:04:04.790> at<00:04:04.910> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
themselves is are shot off valves at the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.539 
themselves is are shot off valves at the
top<00:04:05.180> here<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:06.230> what<00:04:06.620> this<00:04:06.769> enables<00:04:06.980> us<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.280> do

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
top here so what this enables us to do

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.150 
top here so what this enables us to do
is<00:04:07.760> if<00:04:08.060> we<00:04:08.239> just<00:04:08.420> put<00:04:09.350> these<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.769> closed

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
is if we just put these to the closed

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.819 
is if we just put these to the closed
position<00:04:10.359> that<00:04:11.359> allows<00:04:11.600> us<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.810> separate<00:04:12.350> each

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
position that allows us to separate each

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.190 
position that allows us to separate each
individual<00:04:13.790> tube<00:04:14.120> section<00:04:14.510> within<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.900> tent

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
individual tube section within the tent

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.860
