00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:31.130 

all<00:00:16.350> these<00:00:16.590> screws<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> come<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:30.140> okay

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
all these screws have to come out okay

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.569 
all these screws have to come out okay
now<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.949> take<00:00:32.099> off<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> rubber

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
now we're going to take off the rubber

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.030 
now we're going to take off the rubber
part<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
part and we're going to use a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.150 
part and we're going to use a
screwdriver<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.149> glued<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
screwdriver because it's glued on so you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.619 
screwdriver because it's glued on so you
need<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> careful<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:39.180> taking<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
need to be careful when you're taking it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.549 
need to be careful when you're taking it
all<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.980> need<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.340> under<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> rubber<00:00:41.940> part

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
all you need to go under the rubber part

00:00:42.559 --> 00:01:07.219 
all you need to go under the rubber part
in<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.710> case<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.040> already<00:00:44.190> took<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> off

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.870 

now<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.500> jack<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.860> exposed<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.610> need<00:01:09.790> to

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
now that the jack is exposed you need to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.679 
now that the jack is exposed you need to
check<00:01:10.090> these<00:01:10.360> dreams<00:01:10.899> of<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:12.280> jack<00:01:12.549> and<00:01:12.820> if

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
check these dreams of a jack and if

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.499 
check these dreams of a jack and if
they're<00:01:13.840> loose<00:01:14.049> you<00:01:14.290> need<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.590> reciter<00:01:14.950> them

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
they're loose you need to reciter them

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.060 
they're loose you need to reciter them
my<00:01:16.509> case<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.899> jack<00:01:17.110> wasn't<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.500> problem<00:01:17.920> so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
my case the jack wasn't a problem so

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.779 
my case the jack wasn't a problem so
we're<00:01:18.220> gonna<00:01:18.310> go<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.700> other<00:01:18.820> side<00:01:20.789> all

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
we're gonna go to the other side all

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.179 
we're gonna go to the other side all
right<00:01:21.850> well<00:01:22.330> this<00:01:22.509> is<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:22.689> padding<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.680> I

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
right well this is just padding and I

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.639 
right well this is just padding and I
put<00:01:24.460> some<00:01:24.490> duct<00:01:24.880> tape<00:01:24.970> there<00:01:25.330> because<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:26.439> the

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
put some duct tape there because of the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.380 
put some duct tape there because of the
kick<00:01:26.890> drum<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.369> there's<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.610> hole<00:01:27.850> there<00:01:28.090> and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
kick drum and there's a hole there and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.899 
kick drum and there's a hole there and
you're<00:01:29.289> gonna<00:01:29.380> have<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.679> flip<00:01:29.950> this<00:01:30.189> over<00:01:30.490> but

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
you're gonna have to flip this over but

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.279 
you're gonna have to flip this over but
be<00:01:31.090> careful<00:01:31.479> because<00:01:31.600> there<00:01:31.840> are<00:01:31.929> two<00:01:32.049> wires

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
be careful because there are two wires

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.590 
be careful because there are two wires
that<00:01:32.409> are<00:01:32.560> kind<00:01:33.369> of<00:01:33.429> glued<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> back<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.420> it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
that are kind of glued to the back of it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.719 
that are kind of glued to the back of it
and<00:01:36.959> this<00:01:37.959> is<00:01:38.170> though<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.100> think<00:01:39.280> that's<00:01:39.580> what

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
and this is though I think that's what

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.380 
and this is though I think that's what
you<00:01:39.789> call<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:42.549> some<00:01:42.580> tape<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.240> these

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
you call it and I put some tape on these

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.440 
you call it and I put some tape on these
two<00:01:43.600> wires<00:01:43.840> because<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.789> secure<00:01:46.270> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
two wires because just to secure the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.820 
two wires because just to secure the
wires<00:01:47.580> it's<00:01:48.580> also<00:01:48.759> soldered<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.649> where<00:01:50.799> I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
wires it's also soldered this is where I

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.130 
wires it's also soldered this is where I
soldered<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:55.420> right<00:01:55.569> now<00:01:55.840> we're<00:01:56.020> gonna

try<00:01:56.439> and<00:01:56.590> see<00:01:56.770> if<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:56.950> works<00:01:57.130> on<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.429> drums

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
try and see if it works on the drums

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.510 
try and see if it works on the drums

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.780 
to make sure this is lined up with that
I<00:02:41.840> didn't<00:02:42.840> cool<00:02:43.080> back<00:02:43.350> on<00:02:43.590> because<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.520> doesn't

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
I didn't cool back on because it doesn't

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.120 
I didn't cool back on because it doesn't
really<00:02:44.940> matter<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.450> mean<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.410> still<00:02:46.650> works<00:02:46.860> fine

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
really matter I mean it still works fine
