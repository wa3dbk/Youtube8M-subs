engine is on and sucking in air for

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.599 
engine is on and sucking in air for
combustion<00:00:18.590> this<00:00:19.590> gauge<00:00:19.800> tells<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.279> how<00:00:20.460> much

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.770 
combustion this gauge tells you how much
air<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.880> present<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.600> engine<00:00:21.870> to<00:00:21.990> use

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
air is present for the engine to use

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.910 
air is present for the engine to use
there<00:00:24.780> are<00:00:24.870> three<00:00:25.080> factors<00:00:25.440> affecting

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
there are three factors affecting

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
there are three factors affecting
manifold<00:00:26.340> pressure<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.480> first<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.930> ambient

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
manifold pressure the first is ambient

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.870 
manifold pressure the first is ambient
air<00:00:28.530> pressure<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.100> this<00:00:29.220> determines<00:00:29.730> how

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
air pressure and this determines how

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
air pressure and this determines how
much<00:00:30.060> air<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.360> in<00:00:30.630> chicken<00:00:30.930> use<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:32.070> second

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
much air they in chicken use the second

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.830 
much air they in chicken use the second
is<00:00:32.489> throttle<00:00:32.820> position<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
is throttle position and this is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
is throttle position and this is
proportional<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.860> manifold<00:00:35.219> pressure

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
proportional to your manifold pressure

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.910 
proportional to your manifold pressure
and<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:36.449> you<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.660> RPM<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> inversely

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and then you have RPM which is inversely

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.739 
and then you have RPM which is inversely
proportional<00:00:38.039> to<00:00:38.609> manifold<00:00:39.089> pressure<00:00:39.329> but

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
proportional to manifold pressure but

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.360 
proportional to manifold pressure but
this<00:00:39.870> rule<00:00:40.170> changes<00:00:40.649> slightly<00:00:41.159> in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this rule changes slightly in

this rule changes slightly in
supercharged<00:00:41.879> engines

in normally aspirated engines manifold

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.759 
in normally aspirated engines manifold
pressure<00:00:49.539> won't<00:00:49.870> exceed<00:00:50.199> ambient<00:00:50.680> air

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
pressure won't exceed ambient air

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
pressure but with superchargers they

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.479 
pressure but with superchargers they
make<00:00:53.199> manifold<00:00:53.680> pressure<00:00:53.920> exceed<00:00:54.370> the

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
make manifold pressure exceed the

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.860 
make manifold pressure exceed the
ambient<00:00:54.850> air<00:00:54.969> pressure<00:00:55.149> because<00:00:55.780> they

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
ambient air pressure because they

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.720 
ambient air pressure because they
compress<00:00:56.260> air<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.680> force<00:00:56.949> more<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.460> into

compress air and force more of it into
the<00:00:57.820> same<00:00:58.000> volume<00:00:58.239> this<00:00:59.050> provides<00:00:59.469> more<00:00:59.649> power

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
the same volume this provides more power

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.649 
the same volume this provides more power
especially<00:01:00.699> at<00:01:00.760> high<00:01:00.879> altitude<00:01:01.360> where<00:01:01.539> air

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
especially at high altitude where air

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.530 
especially at high altitude where air
density<00:01:01.839> is<00:01:02.140> low<00:01:02.760> let's<00:01:03.760> see<00:01:03.969> how<00:01:04.119> manifold

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
density is low let's see how manifold

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.190 
density is low let's see how manifold
pressure<00:01:04.750> works<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:10.450> start<00:01:10.720> with<00:01:10.899> for<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200

engine<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.590> off<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.070> we're<00:01:12.190> at<00:01:12.250> sea<00:01:12.430> level<00:01:12.610> yet

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
engine is off and we're at sea level yet

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.760 
engine is off and we're at sea level yet
the<00:01:13.479> manifold<00:01:13.869> pressure<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.229> still<00:01:14.409> having<00:01:14.590> a

the manifold pressure is still having a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.889 
the manifold pressure is still having a
reading<00:01:15.009> so<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:15.940> can<00:01:16.090> see<00:01:16.299> they're<00:01:16.570> having<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
reading so we can see they're having the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.950 
reading so we can see they're having the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.359 
engine off measures ambient air pressure
now<00:01:19.960> I've<00:01:20.110> taken<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.530> aircraft<00:01:20.920> up<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.220> five

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
now I've taken the aircraft up to five

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.680 
now I've taken the aircraft up to five
and<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.610> half<00:01:21.700> thousand<00:01:22.119> meters<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.630> the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
and a half thousand meters and the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.899 
and a half thousand meters and the
engine<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.110> off<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.550> manifold

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
engine is off because the manifold

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.490 
engine is off because the manifold
pressure<00:01:25.210> gauge<00:01:25.479> is<00:01:25.659> measuring<00:01:26.020> ambient<00:01:26.409> air

pressure gauge is measuring ambient air

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.260 
pressure gauge is measuring ambient air
pressure<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:27.100> can<00:01:27.610> see<00:01:27.819> how<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.060> air

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
pressure you can see how the air

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.510 
pressure you can see how the air
pressure<00:01:28.450> has<00:01:28.690> fallen<00:01:28.990> with<00:01:29.259> altitude<00:01:29.560> this

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
pressure has fallen with altitude this

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.859 
pressure has fallen with altitude this
means<00:01:30.819> that<00:01:31.000> there<00:01:31.149> is<00:01:31.179> less<00:01:31.270> air<00:01:31.630> available

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
means that there is less air available

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.660 
means that there is less air available
to<00:01:32.200> combust<00:01:32.560> which<00:01:32.830> will<00:01:33.009> lead<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.399> lower

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
to combust which will lead to a lower

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.880 
to combust which will lead to a lower
overall<00:01:33.940> power

to<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.569> is<00:02:06.780> imagine<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:07.350> happens

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
to think of this is imagine what happens

inside<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.500> vacuum<00:02:13.950> tube<00:02:14.160> will<00:02:14.310> drop<00:02:14.549> just

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
inside the vacuum tube will drop just

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.150 
inside the vacuum tube will drop just
like<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.540> example<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.739> engine<00:02:17.040> is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
like this example the engine is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.100 
like this example the engine is
basically<00:02:17.370> starving<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.239> air<00:02:18.420> at<00:02:18.780> idle

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
basically starving for air at idle

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.400 
basically starving for air at idle
throttle<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:20.450> we're<00:02:21.450> airborne<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.079> flying

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
throttle now we're airborne and flying

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.820 
throttle now we're airborne and flying
but<00:02:22.890> I'm<00:02:23.010> still<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> tidal<00:02:23.670> flow

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
but I'm still a tidal flow

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.010 
but I'm still a tidal flow
now<00:02:25.160> as<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.490> start<00:02:25.700> increasing<00:02:26.210> throttle<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
now as I start increasing throttle the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.600 
now as I start increasing throttle the
manifold<00:02:27.440> pressure<00:02:27.650> starts<00:02:28.040> climbing<00:02:28.490> from

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
manifold pressure starts climbing from

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.220 
manifold pressure starts climbing from
its<00:02:28.790> negative<00:02:29.180> pressure<00:02:29.420> up<00:02:29.750> towards<00:02:30.170> the

its negative pressure up towards the
ambient<00:02:30.650> air<00:02:30.740> pressure<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.820> at<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.060> rpm

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
ambient air pressure because at this rpm

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.780 
ambient air pressure because at this rpm
pistons<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.350> very<00:02:33.590> high<00:02:33.740> suction<00:02:34.070> so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
pistons have a very high suction so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.370 
pistons have a very high suction so
they're<00:02:34.940> sucking<00:02:35.210> in<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.750> more<00:02:35.840> air<00:02:36.170> as

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
they're sucking in more and more air as

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.010 
they're sucking in more and more air as
I<00:02:36.530> increase<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.980> throttle<00:02:37.570> if<00:02:38.570> this<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.990> a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
I increase the throttle if this was a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.140 
I increase the throttle if this was a
normally<00:02:39.500> aspirated<00:02:39.680> engine<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.730> manifold

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
normally aspirated engine the manifold

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.340 
normally aspirated engine the manifold
pressure<00:02:41.420> would<00:02:41.600> stop<00:02:41.840> here<00:02:42.050> at<00:02:42.140> full

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
pressure would stop here at full

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.110 
pressure would stop here at full
throttle<00:02:42.590> because<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.610> ambient<00:02:43.910> air

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
throttle because this is the ambient air

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.250 
throttle because this is the ambient air
pressure<00:02:44.300> at<00:02:44.570> sea<00:02:44.750> level

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
pressure at sea level

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.070

however<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.640> engine<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.120> supercharged<00:02:47.750> so

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
however this engine is supercharged so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.740 
however this engine is supercharged so
we<00:02:48.200> can<00:02:48.380> compress<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.950> air<00:02:48.980> coming<00:02:49.340> in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
we can compress the air coming in

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
we can compress the air coming in
compressed<00:02:50.750> air<00:02:50.990> takes<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.440> less<00:02:51.620> volume<00:02:51.920> so

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
compressed air takes up less volume so

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.920 
compressed air takes up less volume so
you<00:02:52.460> can<00:02:52.610> actually<00:02:52.850> fit<00:02:53.150> more<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:53.810> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
you can actually fit more of it in the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.830 
you can actually fit more of it in the
same<00:02:54.140> bowl<00:02:54.520> bit<00:02:55.520> more<00:02:55.760> air<00:02:56.000> coming<00:02:56.210> in<00:02:56.540> you

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
same bowl bit more air coming in you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.690 
same bowl bit more air coming in you
alter<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> mixture<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.680> add<00:02:57.800> more<00:02:58.010> fuel<00:02:58.340> and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
alter the mixture to add more fuel and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.690 
alter the mixture to add more fuel and
this<00:02:58.850> gives<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.300> more<00:02:59.450> power<00:03:00.460> lastly<00:03:01.460> we<00:03:01.610> will

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
this gives you more power lastly we will

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.610 
this gives you more power lastly we will
look<00:03:01.850> at<00:03:01.940> how<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.180> RPM<00:03:02.750> affects<00:03:03.110> manifold

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
look at how the RPM affects manifold

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.250 
look at how the RPM affects manifold
pressure

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.170 

the<00:03:06.560> amount<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.980> suction<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.550> determined<00:03:08.090> by

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the amount of suction is determined by

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.880 
the amount of suction is determined by
how<00:03:08.360> fast<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.840> Pistons<00:03:09.230> move<00:03:09.440> up<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.739> down

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
how fast the Pistons move up and down

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.520 
how fast the Pistons move up and down
which<00:03:10.220> we<00:03:10.400> call<00:03:10.640> rpm

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
which we call rpm

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.699 
which we call rpm
as<00:03:12.040> rpm<00:03:12.640> increases<00:03:13.020> suction<00:03:14.020> increases<00:03:14.500> and

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
as rpm increases suction increases and

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.250 
as rpm increases suction increases and
manifold<00:03:15.190> pressure<00:03:15.430> drops<00:03:16.260> supercharged

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
manifold pressure drops supercharged

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.140 
manifold pressure drops supercharged
engines<00:03:17.650> compensate<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.580> job<00:03:18.819> because

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
engines compensate for this job because

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.589 
engines compensate for this job because
they<00:03:19.270> keep<00:03:19.480> compressing<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.170> airs

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
they keep compressing the airs

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.080 
they keep compressing the airs
but<00:03:22.109> eventually<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:23.040> RPM<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.609> suction<00:03:23.969> can

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
but eventually the RPM and suction can

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.940 
but eventually the RPM and suction can
get<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.480> high<00:03:24.689> that<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.140> supercharger<00:03:25.739> can't

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
get so high that the supercharger can't

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.440 
get so high that the supercharger can't
compensate<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.700> drop<00:03:26.879> anymore

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
compensate for the drop anymore

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.259 
compensate for the drop anymore
and<00:03:27.599> medical<00:03:28.049> pressure<00:03:28.260> for<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:30.030> now<00:03:30.209> we

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
and medical pressure for so now we

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.440 
and medical pressure for so now we
decrease<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.840> RPM<00:03:31.639> suction<00:03:32.639> decreases<00:03:33.209> and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
decrease the RPM suction decreases and

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.620 
decrease the RPM suction decreases and
manifold<00:03:33.870> pressure<00:03:34.109> rises
