00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.059
 today we are talking about price stability 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.890
 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.960
 talks about price stability if the harmonized price index per 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.900
 consumption for the euro area recorded an increase of less than 2% over 12 months 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 could you explain it in simpler words please 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.400
 imagine a shopping cart 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.800
 containing a whole series of products the milk motor dough but also shoes 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 or computer 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.020
 every month we check the price of these sets of goods and we calculate of 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 how many increased or rarely decreased 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.090
 compared to the same month of the previous year 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.140
 if the increase is less than 2%, then we have price stability 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.480
 it's clearer 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.580
 ok let's start from the beginning 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.390
 because we use balances 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.630
 if money did not exist we would have to resort to barter 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.260
 the baker how would you pay a haircut mistaking it with the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.340
 bread 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.370
 but what would happen if the hairdresser did not want the bread as it would 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.430
 paid the situation becomes more complicated 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 that's how money was born to facilitate trade 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.010
 but beware money has not always maintained its value in certain periods 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 prices have skyrocketed 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.320
 welcome 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 help that's happened either 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.320
 but not only do stabbing 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 but 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.340
 we ask what we can do with four friends please 2 please attack i 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.370
 money is not enough she has increased the price 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.700
 but why 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.730
 because people can buy more than there is to sell so don't 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.100
 there are more demands and the flour become more expensive I have to pay in 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100

 but it's a party 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.849
 no for nothing yes there is too much money around for the same number of products 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.489
 prices are pushed up eliminating or losing value you believe there is asking 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.200

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.329

 and my savings lose value every day are always the people threatened 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.639
 which are in times like these here is the true meaning of inflation is one 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.089
 once it starts 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.979
 seems difficult to stop 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 - let's get rid of the charge 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.780
 luckily they came out 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.290
 I wonder who the infections I give you nowadays the teacher did not say 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.260
 something about the European central bank and price stability yes there 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.989
 we feel we know more 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.989
 patatoni both 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.369
 newlyweds 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.369
 It is true that your work and keeping prices stable 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.119
 how to do 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.739
 Italian post office 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.129
 what can i do for you 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.709
 because we have just seen the inflation monster the damage it causes 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.540
 it is you who takes care of this inflation monster yes 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.119
 d were 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.250
 then what to say 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.889
 as an escort 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:10.889
 8 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.590
 here okay infostud infractions 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.439
 she tiny 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.560
 of course 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.979
 because our job of ensuring price stability 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.550
 we aim to keep inflation at levels below but close to 2% a 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.590
 medium term bah 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.040
 let's see if there are risks to price stability 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.610
 we carry out two types of analysis 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.330
 first we follow a number of factors 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.210
 how economic growth is the price of oil 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.219
 which could cause short-term price increases 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.530
 and as a second thing we keep an eye on the amount of money that circulates 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.199
 in the economy because this could increase prices between medium and long 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.099
 term 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.529
 we know that in the past all the phases of high inflation have been 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.820
 accompanied by an excessive amount of money in circulation 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.430
 if an excessive amount of money chases too few goods 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.569
 we risk an increase in inflation 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.009
 it's like everyone wants to buy the site there is a market 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.180
 synchronization occurs only if there is a general increase in 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.720
 prices 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.289
 not just the price of sweets 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.089
 but that of all the goods and services and you what you can do 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.629
 you can prevent baker from raising the price of his products we cannot 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.389
 but we decide the interest rate 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.059
 get explained 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.639
 if you take a loan to buy a car with a new fridge, for example 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.030
 you have to pay an interest that is calculated based on a rate of 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.820
 interest 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.669
 in other words the interest rate and the price of money 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.689
 the higher the price of money or the lower interest rate will be 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.509
 Money demand is less likely than people borrow money itself 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.880
 pays an exact high price too 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.370
 - that's why our job is to set the level of rates 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.160
 interest 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.320
 ensuring that prices remain stable over time 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.240
 quite right 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.889
 and if prices are stable, trust is established and it is easier to save 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.240
 invest 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.729
 if you make purchases in a few months, things will cost more or less the same 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.159
 hour figure 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:17.680
 moreover, companies will invest more helping the economy to grow and create 

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:21.710
 jobs and this makes a dry skins keyboard 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.369
 an expansion of this small and can be a problem for the economy 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:30.939
 was even to lose confidence in the text money that's why we at the bank 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:32.110
 European Central Bank 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.880
 their system we take our mission so seriously 1 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.050
 I sit down 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.460
 it is formed by the European central bank and by the national central banks of the 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.020
 euro area countries 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.499
 however it is not the only one that we keep an eye on all 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:51.899
 it is in fact presented by deduction 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.449
 and what it would be 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.219
 penetration and a general decrease in holy prices 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:58.819
 tonight in wine 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.419
 like inflation although it can damage the economy 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:03.800
 for example 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.729
 if all prices continue to arrive 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.650
 bears railings for the purchase of an asset waiting for it will cost less than the 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.870
 following week 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.759
 and even less after a month 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:17.330
 for the same reason a company may decide to postpone its own 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.300
 investments 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.039
 economy would suffer from this question can dog courses 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:28.199
 those therefore main objective of the European central bank and 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:30.099
 Eurosystem 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:31.949
 then 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:35.279
 keep price stability well 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.999
 hey fight the bites love you translation 

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.210
 why not 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.190
 I suppose we can call it that step
