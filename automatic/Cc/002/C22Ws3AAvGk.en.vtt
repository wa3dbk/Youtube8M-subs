00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello ali today I would like to show 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.130
 how I make myself glucose 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.990
 is a very simple thing 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.849
 you do not need much but you need it 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.040
 keep these people relatively often 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.019
 you can also buy ready but 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.089
 completely unjustified and that leaves 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.230
 I myself need it very easily 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.060
 for 500 milliliters of water and 500 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.220
 sugar a second small one 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.240
 vase and calm off after that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.670
 a bit about the sugar ago 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.869
 introduce and then this in the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.929
 to make vials clean 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 I'll give that to the pot now 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.790
 was the first to be taken in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.739
 it is now heated for the first time to cook 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.660
 brought 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.309
 only then is now even at so 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 do differently than write caramel as 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.710
 is only now arriving 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.059
 if we are so a bit 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.809
 is caramelized with water 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.989
 cast 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 which is it the other way around then cooks then 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.579
 So now even in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 cover off and first makes smaller 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.480
 and then gives the whole thing for the first time 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.930
 sugar so influence on half 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.539
 liters of water and then calm the whole thing 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.820
 a bit by itself should be nice too 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.490
 trigger it even then you leave that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.710
 Simmer whole system minutes lightly 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.850
 this cooks everything here relatively strong 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.450
 that may also be a bit quiet 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.640
 its dollar 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 he is good, so to speak, even now 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.509
 Purified as one said earlier 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 In the past, sugar was even more 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.110
 more contaminated with small pieces 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.689
 not belonged 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.369
 in this process, the sugar then begins 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.530
 even a little bit to look at 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.900
 and this year will be in general 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.710
 the solids deals listed 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.570
 could be 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.909
 you can move up with you 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.259
 then so if you can do so beautiful 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.630
 You can do it with spoonfuls 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.280
 pull off and can because by side 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.450
 do 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.229
 It's about ten minutes 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.869
 past 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.549
 I'm getting out and doing now 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.210
 now the whole pot of liquid 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.579
 or the liquid here is a glass mess 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.320
 mug in 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.979
 They also want to know how much liquid 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.610
 now comes in total and also are 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.060
 that's about 700 milliliters now 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.069
 of what's in the bottle 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.679
 about 200 milliliters in this 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.450
 small vial 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:24.760
 which is called a bit before 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:27.109
 flushed out a bit so much 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.719
 I'll give the rest back to you 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:33.739
 pot and cook the rest 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:38.329
 glucose again ten minutes 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.129
 it's about there that I'm here 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.849
 so different concentrations for me 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.769
 produce 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.579
 that's one of them 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.239
 cocktails in others for cake so for 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.319
 cake bottoms or even for fruit salad may 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.150
 of course I have the surfaces before 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.010
 also played out again means 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.230
 actually less because I'm scared 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.329
 that he breaks many more 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.769
 I want that to be really clean too 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.780
 and not any remaining kaymer 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.799
 there are still in there I fit in 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.219
 a little more on that, not again 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.760
 So you can see golf then already 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.769
 a being that the consistency is different 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.629
 so it's more like yours on the 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.530
 others were even more watery suits 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.659
 not quite a small drop remains 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.669
 All right, I have to go right now 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:27.439
 one would rather try it too 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:30.889
 a lot of problem that is also such a 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.359
 unit of how much sugar in the 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.000
 liquid exists i know now 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.859
 not exactly how that is what is said 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.790
 will stop 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.689
 june determines the specific weight 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.810
 is there for the individual 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.979
 concentration still individual 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.509
 application areas so you can see that 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:50.120
 the color here maybe is 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:52.519
 something very clear actually here is so 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.229
 a bit slightly yellowish may be because 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.120
 you realize I know the little ones 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.669
 Bottles are stronger the bigger ones 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.109
 bottle lighter concentration 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.930
 I wish you much fun 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:07.669
 possibly copying and use 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.379
 the lactose enjoys a good appetite 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.650
 Drink the cocktail to let the 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.609
 sweet dishes yes and see you next time 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.609
 bye
