00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.840

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.650

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.750
 I have black vallÃ¨s that I put 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.369
 accessories that raise it a little more 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.680
 you have to be careful with the accessories 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.660
 same because we are at the limit of 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.580

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 I like it is the noise it makes is very 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.310
 modern 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.620
 and he has black he has silver and in this 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.360
 I put on some shoes that I 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.220
 I'm going to take out because I do not practice and they're a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.710
 little high and some stilettos with shine 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.230
 with this black edge that remain super 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.600
 canchers and these stylized 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.030
 elegant for the occasion you want to see the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.040
 second and the second option 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.590
 a red dress a color too 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.420
 timeless but the cut maybe some 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.009
 they feel a little uncomfortable to ostrava 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.810
 love is a very universe style and not 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 this of being irregular that is very but 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.800
 Very trendy is a trend in Europe and in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.010

 I put this ring that is pretty 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.400
 important I would not recharge it because the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.800

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 morochas to the blondes like the red ones 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.830
 but if we add too much to this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.619
 dress speaks only with tacos with 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.600

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.420
 very important back then maybe 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.150
 the only thing I would add is the clutch 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.890

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.540

 boring everywhere is a dress 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.959

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.600

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.150

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.730

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.310
 trend and here if you have lolas you put on 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.069
 a side in skin color and you can 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.200
 perfectly use it if it's not perfect 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.840
 for which we have a little and 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.110
 we want to look and be sexy is a 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.030
 short dress that is not a dress 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.370
 temporary this dress you put it in a 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.440
 party and the next day you also say 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.450

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.760
 you will not be able to with this dress speaks 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.640
 you're just going to have the whole party going to 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.819
 say she had that dress but it's 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.459
 super sexy vila is not feminine and in this 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.160
 occasion I will use this envelope that is the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.200
 bar my mom never used color 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.690

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.700
 embroidered a small detail then it goes 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.650
 super good with these shoes that are in 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.780
 color nude here if we go back to the stiletto 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.120
 because you have to use when we use a 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.610
 short dress 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.700
 If you are high you do not always have to have 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.739
 a little bit of taco you like me now 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.790
 to leave my class we will go to the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.069
 quarter fourth and last option look 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.450
 these little rings that I have that are a 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.730
 little bit but you would have to put up 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.760
 because that's how we are going to a 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.650
 party the pleat another trend in 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.379
 Party dresses and also this color 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.239
 champagne color is a timeless color 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.340
 you can look good for the wedding of 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.760
 your sister for a friend's party 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.250
 it's very, very fine, you do not look like 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.680
 the girlfriend I do recommend a tip 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.230
 with long dresses always flush with a 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.459
 side of the other but you take for a 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.069
 I cost you how I take it to the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.599
 right and one walks smart if you 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.489
 you have to move to not drag it and 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.290
 that you end up doing that is the 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.769
 dress that always happens and we finish the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.200
 Dry cleaner looks at the back apenitas is 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.920
 super sexy what yes I recommend you 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.420
 in this case, use a strapless and you 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.480
 can fill a little more because this one 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.730
 the important thing is the same but 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.650
 here it is super elegant without any 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.739
 accessory simply hoops with a 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.930
 collected and super high shoes in this 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.730

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.410
 blacks that I have always keep me 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.480
 clothes but with a little taco 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.680
 could be in this case I chose blacks 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.950
 could be a golden Ã²mnium very very 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.230
 high is like this because the pleat see if not 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.570
 we spent it during the whole party and 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.660
 it could be any of these two 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.610
