at<00:02:00.930> someone<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.640> exercises<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.060> I

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
at someone that exercises a lot and I

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.490 
at someone that exercises a lot and I
look<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.630> fit<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.110> we'll<00:02:04.259> say<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
look really fit and we'll say that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.490 
look really fit and we'll say that
person<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.070> very<00:02:05.310> toned<00:02:05.810> for<00:02:06.810> someone<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> have

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
person is very toned for someone to have

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.130 
person is very toned for someone to have
muscle<00:02:08.039> tone<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:09.060> simply<00:02:09.539> means<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.899> their

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
muscle tone that simply means that their

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
muscle tone that simply means that their
muscles<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.679> staying<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.400> slightly

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
muscles are staying in a slightly

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.809 
muscles are staying in a slightly
contracted<00:02:12.959> state

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
contracted state

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.289 
contracted state
constantly<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:15.709> happens<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.670> response<00:02:16.849> to

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
constantly this happens in response to

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.630 
constantly this happens in response to
somebody<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.900> works<00:02:18.200> those<00:02:18.530> muscles<00:02:19.040> very

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
somebody that works those muscles very

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.170 
somebody that works those muscles very
very<00:02:19.970> often<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:22.099> reason<00:02:22.670> your<00:02:22.819> muscles

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
very often the reason your muscles

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.569 
very often the reason your muscles
become<00:02:23.599> toned<00:02:24.019> as<00:02:24.409> you<00:02:24.650> use<00:02:24.980> them<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.519> because

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
become toned as you use them is because

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.530 
become toned as you use them is because
they<00:02:26.269> become<00:02:26.720> prepared<00:02:27.730> for<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.090> use<00:02:29.329> them

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
they become prepared for you to use them

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.780 
they become prepared for you to use them
at<00:02:29.689> any<00:02:29.930> moment<00:02:30.440> if<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:31.099> think<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.579> in<00:02:31.700> a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
at any moment if you think of it in a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.869 
at any moment if you think of it in a
slightly<00:02:32.030> silly<00:02:32.480> way<00:02:32.720> let's<00:02:33.530> say<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.250> am

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
slightly silly way let's say that I am

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.330 
slightly silly way let's say that I am
the<00:02:35.000> type<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.269> person<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.659> does<00:02:36.190> crunches<00:02:37.190> or

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the type of person that does crunches or

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.490 
the type of person that does crunches or
ab<00:02:37.489> work<00:02:37.760> all<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.180> time<00:02:38.420> I'm<00:02:38.989> probably<00:02:39.230> going

ab work all the time I'm probably going

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.309 
ab work all the time I'm probably going
to<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:39.650> nicely<00:02:40.190> toned<00:02:40.489> ab<00:02:40.819> muscles<00:02:41.510> why<00:02:42.260> do

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
to have nicely toned ab muscles why do

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.470 
to have nicely toned ab muscles why do
they<00:02:42.530> need<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.769> be<00:02:42.890> toned<00:02:43.189> because<00:02:43.939> those<00:02:44.269> ab

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
they need to be toned because those ab

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.360 
they need to be toned because those ab
muscles<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.959> no<00:02:45.170> idea<00:02:45.530> when<00:02:46.040> I'm<00:02:46.159> going<00:02:46.310> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
muscles have no idea when I'm going to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.819

call on them to do their next crunch so

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.949 
call on them to do their next crunch so
they<00:02:48.980> stay<00:02:49.220> nice<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.790> firm<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.090> healthy<00:02:50.720> and

they stay nice and firm and healthy and
they're<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.470> ready<00:02:51.829> at<00:02:52.129> any<00:02:52.519> moment<00:02:52.639> for<00:02:53.540> me

to need them the major topic we have

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.330 
to need them the major topic we have
left<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.180> cover<00:02:59.359> in<00:02:59.569> chapter<00:02:59.930> 9<00:03:00.139> is<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.859> go<00:03:00.980> over

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
left to cover in chapter 9 is to go over

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.180 
left to cover in chapter 9 is to go over
the<00:03:01.489> sources<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.389> ATP<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.319> we<00:03:03.500> have<00:03:03.739> when<00:03:04.040> in

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
the sources of ATP that we have when in

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.970 
the sources of ATP that we have when in
our<00:03:04.310> muscle<00:03:04.670> cell<00:03:04.940> we<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:05.780> three<00:03:06.409> different

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
our muscle cell we have three different

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.240 
our muscle cell we have three different
ways<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.670> which<00:03:07.849> we<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.239> generate<00:03:08.450> ATP<00:03:09.139> and<00:03:09.620> if

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
ways in which we can generate ATP and if

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.129 
ways in which we can generate ATP and if
you<00:03:10.370> recall<00:03:10.519> from<00:03:10.849> our<00:03:11.000> last<00:03:11.180> lecture<00:03:11.450> the

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
you recall from our last lecture the

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.220 
you recall from our last lecture the
availability<00:03:12.889> of<00:03:13.159> ATP<00:03:13.639> is<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.209> crucial<00:03:14.780> step<00:03:15.019> in

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
availability of ATP is a crucial step in

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.899 
availability of ATP is a crucial step in
the<00:03:15.260> ability<00:03:15.739> for<00:03:15.889> a<00:03:15.950> muscle<00:03:16.370> fiber<00:03:16.400> to

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
the ability for a muscle fiber to

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.869 
the ability for a muscle fiber to
contract<00:03:17.769> recall<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:19.010> as<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.340> myosin<00:03:19.669> head

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.349 
contract recall that as the myosin head
reaches<00:03:20.629> up<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:20.959> grabs<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.769> actin<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.519> ATP

reaches up and grabs the actin the ATP

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.569 
reaches up and grabs the actin the ATP
is<00:03:23.480> used<00:03:23.510> as<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.230> myosin<00:03:24.440> head<00:03:24.739> completes<00:03:25.400> the

and bond to the myosin head therefore we

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.689

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
with anaerobic metabolism this is going

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.399 
with anaerobic metabolism this is going
