00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.900
 knead not very cool dough 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.610
 but such a test turns out enough 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.450
 dense but at the same time gentle soft 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.440
 from it we need to roll the same 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.440
 balloons 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.979
 schools 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 and lay out in the form 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.480
 level, that is, since then the problem method 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 cognac 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.320
 it is purely accepted so do not 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.899
 too thick tests 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.899
 otherwise there will be nowhere to put them 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.390
 wooden floor points and making small over 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.390

 and put in a preheated oven until ready 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.769
 Here are our baskets caked 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.609
 if the dough you too much 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.059
 climbed there while on hot can 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.339
 show it with your finger 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.449
 The simplest penny recall jam or 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.549
 by computer 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.329
 for decorating cakes we need 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.779

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.049

 then gradually add portions 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.879
 powdered sugar 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
 continue to beat

 and when the cream just started a little 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.329
 thickens we add 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.449
 cream thickener 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.449
 and continuing to beat up the thickening

 cream is ready so they get 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.149
 consistency
