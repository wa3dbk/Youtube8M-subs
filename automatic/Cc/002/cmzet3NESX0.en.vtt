00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
thought it covered more ground and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.670

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
ultimately a focused on more of the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.220

as well now for starters in the
beginning<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.789> chapter<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.539> makes<00:00:27.720> me

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
beginning of chapter really makes me

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.419 
beginning of chapter really makes me
question<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> hell<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.250> with

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
question what the hell is going on with

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.179 
question what the hell is going on with
manzetti<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.390> some<00:00:30.570> sort<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.869> trap<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
manzetti is it some sort of trap are the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
manzetti is it some sort of trap are the
tornados<00:00:32.850> once<00:00:33.149> again<00:00:33.480> misled<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.410> we

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
tornados once again misled because we

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
tornados once again misled because we
know<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.710> Tatars<00:00:35.550> are<00:00:35.700> practically

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
know that Tatars are practically

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.600 
know that Tatars are practically
borderline<00:00:37.200> retarded<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.460> always

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
borderline retarded because we always

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
borderline retarded because we always
been<00:00:38.879> there<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.210> quite<00:00:39.300> some<00:00:39.600> time<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.960> she's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
been there for quite some time and she's

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.049 
been there for quite some time and she's
never<00:00:40.290> even<00:00:40.530> heard<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.070> princess<00:00:41.520> man<00:00:41.730> seddie

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
never even heard a princess man seddie

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.940 
never even heard a princess man seddie
so<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.809> either<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.739> things

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
so that's either one of two things

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
so that's either one of two things
either<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.300> Sontarans<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:45.930> being

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
either one the Sontarans are being

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.490 
either one the Sontarans are being
misled<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.800> two<00:00:47.430> princess<00:00:48.390> manatees<00:00:48.960> power<00:00:49.200> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
misled or two princess manatees power is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.220 
misled or two princess manatees power is
so<00:00:49.739> vast<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.789> incredible<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.050> never

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so vast and incredible that they never

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.350 
so vast and incredible that they never
wanted<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.770> her<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> find<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.149> just

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
wanted to her to find out and they just

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
wanted to her to find out and they just
hid<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.750> her<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.170> there's<00:00:55.469> something

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
hid it from her or there's something

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
hid it from her or there's something
definitely<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.090> they

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
definitely there because I think they

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.910 
definitely there because I think they
for<00:00:57.750> her<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.410> heard<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.680> something

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
for her to not have heard of something

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
for her to not have heard of something
like<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.280> once<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.820> princess<00:01:00.359> mention<00:01:00.809> these

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
like this once if princess mention these

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
like this once if princess mention these
powers<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.770> help<00:01:01.920> them<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.309> then

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
powers can really help them out then

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160 
powers can really help them out then

less<00:01:17.520> where<00:01:17.729> she's<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.659> least<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.020> got

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
less where she's at so at least we got

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
less where she's at so at least we got

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
even though again like I said last week

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.920 
even though again like I said last week
I'm<00:01:23.759> saying<00:01:23.939> again<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> don't<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.659> care

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
I'm saying again I don't really care

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
I'm saying again I don't really care
about<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.259> tornados<00:01:25.830> anymore<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.880> very

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
about the tornados anymore at the very

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.399 
about the tornados anymore at the very
least<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> looks<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.689> we're<00:01:28.170> gonna

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
least it looks like we're gonna

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
least it looks like we're gonna
hopefully<00:01:28.860> pass<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.909> part<00:01:30.150> soon<00:01:30.420> because

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
hopefully pass that part soon because

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
hopefully pass that part soon because
the<00:01:31.229> thing<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> tauntaun<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the thing that about the tauntaun is I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
the thing that about the tauntaun is I
guess<00:01:33.000> me<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> most<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.740> why<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
guess me the most is I don't get why I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
guess me the most is I don't get why I
was<00:01:35.340> doing<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> us<00:01:36.150> where<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> have

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
was doing this to us where we have

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.429 
was doing this to us where we have
amazing<00:01:37.799> things<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> most

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
amazing things going on like the most
