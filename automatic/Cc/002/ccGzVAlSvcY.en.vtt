00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
slide down tonight so really most of the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.100 
slide down tonight so really most of the
action<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:51.450> second<00:01:51.869> string

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
action is just on that second string

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.290 
action is just on that second string
there<00:01:52.319> right<00:01:52.560> well<00:01:53.009> most<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.819> us<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> first

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
there right well most of us on the first

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.910 
there right well most of us on the first
string<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> only<00:01:54.990> thing<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.350> actually<00:01:55.679> happen

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
string the only thing is actually happen

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.710 
string the only thing is actually happen
on<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> second<00:01:56.490> string<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> first<00:01:57.330> note

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
on the second string is the first note

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.440 
on the second string is the first note
and<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.860> picking<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.210> pretty

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
and the picking is really it's pretty

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.210 
and the picking is really it's pretty
simple<00:02:00.899> there's<00:02:01.049> nothing<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.069> can

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
simple there's nothing to it you can

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.559 
simple there's nothing to it you can
just<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.610> straight<00:02:03.450> down<00:02:03.780> maybe<00:02:08.299> it's<00:02:09.299> kind<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
just do straight down maybe it's kind of

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.539 
just do straight down maybe it's kind of
more<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> an<00:02:10.200> attitude<00:02:10.380> riff<00:02:11.070> than<00:02:11.310> anything

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
more of an attitude riff than anything

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.950 
more of an attitude riff than anything
else<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.030> here<00:02:12.329> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> slowly

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
else so here it is slowly

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.790 
else so here it is slowly

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.840 

see<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:19.890> kind<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.130> tricky<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.460> get<00:02:20.700> that

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
see it's kind of tricky to get that

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.300 
see it's kind of tricky to get that
pinky<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.360> there<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:21.840> faster<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:22.860> sound<00:02:23.070> a

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
pinky in there but faster it can sound a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:35.420 
pinky in there but faster it can sound a
