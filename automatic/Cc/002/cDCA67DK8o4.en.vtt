00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
well any case that's good so we'll take

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.839 
well any case that's good so we'll take
this<00:02:38.819> sort<00:02:39.599> out<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.680> now<00:02:40.890> we're<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.610> do

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
this sort out so now we're going to do

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.050 
this sort out so now we're going to do
the<00:02:42.030> transformation<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.140> from<00:02:43.500> denno<00:02:43.860> or<00:02:44.430> or

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the transformation is from denno or or

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.920 
the transformation is from denno or or
as<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.360> guide<00:02:45.569> member<00:02:45.780> says<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:46.709> into

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
as the guide member says then go into

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.069 
as the guide member says then go into
Momotaro<00:02:48.930> Sid<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:51.060> we'll<00:02:51.209> do<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.390> from<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
Momotaro Sid so we'll do this from a

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.589 
Momotaro Sid so we'll do this from a
bottom-up<00:02:52.590> method<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:54.269> we're<00:02:54.390> going<00:02:54.510> to

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
bottom-up method and we're going to

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.830 
bottom-up method and we're going to
start<00:02:54.870> by<00:02:55.200> twisting<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.920> waist<00:02:56.160> around<00:02:56.840> now

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
start by twisting the waist around now

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.199 
start by twisting the waist around now
we<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.140> momo's<00:02:58.530> waist<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.190> since<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.060> knee

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
we have momo's waist and since the knee

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.420 
we have momo's waist and since the knee
joint<00:03:00.239> goes<00:03:00.720> back<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.260> forth<00:03:01.319> both<00:03:01.799> ways<00:03:02.100> it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
joint goes back and forth both ways it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.830 
joint goes back and forth both ways it
doesn't<00:03:02.639> matter<00:03:03.060> i<00:03:03.209> don't<00:03:03.359> have<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:03.630> turn

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
doesn't matter i don't have to like turn

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.259 
doesn't matter i don't have to like turn
anything<00:03:04.079> here<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.739> do<00:03:05.579> have<00:03:05.609> to<00:03:05.910> turn<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
anything here you do have to turn the

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.390 
anything here you do have to turn the
feet<00:03:06.540> obviously<00:03:06.810> because<00:03:07.650> otherwise<00:03:07.920> he

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
feet obviously because otherwise he

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.789 
feet obviously because otherwise he
looks<00:03:09.150> dumb<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:12.060> now<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.269> waist<00:03:12.989> there<00:03:13.470> and

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
looks dumb so so now the waist there and

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.420 
looks dumb so so now the waist there and
then<00:03:14.280> we'll<00:03:14.430> turn<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.900> arm<00:03:19.680> around<00:03:20.100> and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
then we'll turn the the arm around and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
then we'll turn the the arm around and
then<00:03:20.609> spin<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:20.970> hand<00:03:21.359> so<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.109> now<00:03:22.410> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
then spin the hand so that now the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.789 
then spin the hand so that now the
moment<00:03:22.920> eros<00:03:24.560> portion<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:27.139> out<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:28.440> wait<00:03:28.560> let's

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
moment eros portion is out to wait let's

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.580 
moment eros portion is out to wait let's
see<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.720> think<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.810> had<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.049> backwards<00:03:31.260> before

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
see I think I had it backwards before

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.410 
see I think I had it backwards before
but<00:03:31.920> let's<00:03:32.190> see<00:03:32.340> there<00:03:32.549> we<00:03:32.639> go<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.000> think<00:03:33.269> this

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
but let's see there we go I think this

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.729 
but let's see there we go I think this
is<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.530> way<00:03:34.650> should<00:03:34.889> i<00:03:36.650> think<00:03:37.650> i

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
is this is the way should i think i

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.910 
is this is the way should i think i
think<00:03:37.859> i<00:03:38.040> forgot<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.430> turn<00:03:38.670> before<00:03:39.680> yeah<00:03:40.680> okay

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
think i forgot to turn before yeah okay

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.539 
think i forgot to turn before yeah okay

what<00:07:09.000> do<00:07:09.090> I<00:07:09.150> have<00:07:09.300> to<00:07:09.360> say<00:07:09.480> about<00:07:09.600> this<00:07:09.840> one

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
what do I have to say about this one

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.810 
what do I have to say about this one
well<00:07:10.200> I'm<00:07:10.470> a<00:07:10.530> little<00:07:10.860> biased<00:07:10.980> towards<00:07:11.520> denno

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
well I'm a little biased towards denno

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.760 
well I'm a little biased towards denno
since<00:07:12.060> it<00:07:12.180> was<00:07:12.300> my<00:07:12.330> first<00:07:12.630> rider<00:07:12.990> series<00:07:13.350> but

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
since it was my first rider series but

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.409 
since it was my first rider series but
it's<00:07:14.190> really<00:07:14.580> cool<00:07:14.790> and<00:07:14.850> it<00:07:15.090> turns<00:07:15.300> into

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
it's really cool and it turns into

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.110 
it's really cool and it turns into
momotaro's<00:07:16.100> so<00:07:17.100> it's<00:07:17.400> kind<00:07:17.640> of<00:07:17.729> like<00:07:17.910> having

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
momotaro's so it's kind of like having

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.850 
momotaro's so it's kind of like having
two<00:07:18.450> figures<00:07:18.840> in<00:07:19.020> one<00:07:19.229> because<00:07:19.590> it<00:07:19.680> turns

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
two figures in one because it turns

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.770 
two figures in one because it turns
another<00:07:20.130> person<00:07:20.550> instead<00:07:20.729> of<00:07:20.850> a<00:07:20.910> weapon<00:07:21.090> or<00:07:21.600> a

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
another person instead of a weapon or a

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.750 
another person instead of a weapon or a
vehicle<00:07:22.680> or<00:07:22.800> some<00:07:22.950> other<00:07:23.040> thing<00:07:23.250> for<00:07:23.460> decayed

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760 
vehicle or some other thing for decayed

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.630 
vehicle or some other thing for decayed

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.070 
to screw around with plus it has the den
common<00:07:27.060> stored<00:07:27.330> with<00:07:27.450> all<00:07:27.570> the<00:07:27.660> message<00:07:28.020> you
