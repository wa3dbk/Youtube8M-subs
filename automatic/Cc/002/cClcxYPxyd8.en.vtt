before we can actually remove the old

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.950 
before we can actually remove the old
water<00:00:03.929> heater<00:00:04.259> we<00:00:05.130> must<00:00:05.400> drain<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.330> as<00:00:06.810> you

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
water heater we must drain it and as you

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.620 
water heater we must drain it and as you
see<00:00:07.170> here<00:00:07.730> it's<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.790> bottle<00:00:09.120> where<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.389> will

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
see here it's a bottle where we will

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.249 
see here it's a bottle where we will
train<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:11.070> calcium<00:00:11.639> buildup<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.450> there's

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
train it the calcium buildup and there's

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.029 
train it the calcium buildup and there's
no<00:00:13.380> way<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.830> get<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> hose<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:16.039> we're

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
no way we can get a hose on it so we're

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.410 
no way we can get a hose on it so we're
gonna<00:00:17.130> try<00:00:17.340> something<00:00:17.789> else<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.240> one

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
gonna try something else with this one

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.830 
gonna try something else with this one
today<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:19.890> see<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.840> control

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
today and here you can see the control

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.310 
today and here you can see the control

very<00:00:25.769> old<00:00:26.220> hot-water<00:00:27.090> heater<00:00:33.320> we're

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
very old hot-water heater we're

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.220 
very old hot-water heater we're
following<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.890> gas<00:00:35.100> line<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> 3/8

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230

line<00:01:15.610> air<00:01:15.880> will<00:01:16.150> be<00:01:16.330> replaced<00:01:16.810> as<00:01:17.710> we<00:01:17.979> were

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
line air will be replaced as we were

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:30.750 
line air will be replaced as we were
saying<00:01:18.310> earlier

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.290

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
main cutoff going into the hot water

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.100 
main cutoff going into the hot water
tank<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.430> we're<00:01:45.880> going<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.330> replace<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:46.990> way

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
tank and we're going to replace that way

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.600 
tank and we're going to replace that way
when<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.320> knew<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.680> this<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.790> kind<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.090> old<00:01:50.610> here

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
when I knew it this is kind of old here

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.680 
when I knew it this is kind of old here
we<00:01:52.030> have<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:53.280> main<00:01:54.280> cutoff<00:01:54.670> cutting<00:01:55.060> into<00:01:55.480> the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
we have the main cutoff cutting into the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.140 
we have the main cutoff cutting into the
building<00:01:56.260> which<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> basement<00:01:57.610> and

building which is in the basement and
most<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.670> cut-offs<00:02:01.120> in<00:02:01.330> any<00:02:01.540> basement

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
most then cut-offs in any basement

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.010 
most then cut-offs in any basement
you're<00:02:02.170> going<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.530> find<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.920> penny<00:02:03.190> at<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
you're going to find a penny at the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.120 
you're going to find a penny at the
front<00:02:05.410> of<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.770> building<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.960> if<00:02:08.680> there<00:02:08.980> is<00:02:09.100> a

the Main Street where the main service

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.260 
the Main Street where the main service
is<00:02:21.960> here<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.650> first<00:02:23.860> thing<00:02:24.010> we<00:02:24.130> do<00:02:24.430> have<00:02:24.820> gas

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
is here the first thing we do have gas

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.220 
is here the first thing we do have gas
that<00:02:25.570> off<00:02:25.750> we're<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:27.010> remove<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:29.200> old

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
that off we're going to remove the old

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:47.540 
that off we're going to remove the old
gas<00:02:29.950> piping

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.720 

now<00:02:48.440> we're<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.800> disconnect<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.610> water

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
now we're going to disconnect the water

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.070 
now we're going to disconnect the water
lines<00:02:51.060> from<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.460> hot<00:02:53.460> water<00:02:53.730> heater<00:02:53.940> itself

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.050 

which<00:02:58.080> by<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.350> way<00:02:58.800> all<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.610> will<00:02:59.910> be

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
which by the way all of this will be

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:31.479 
which by the way all of this will be
changed<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:01.430> three<00:03:02.430> quarter<00:03:02.760> inch<00:03:02.960> in<00:03:03.960> copper

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.600 

as<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.700> said<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:33.000> begin<00:03:33.330> another<00:03:33.510> video<00:03:34.610> you

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
as we said it begin another video you

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.280 
as we said it begin another video you
need<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.030> drain<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.569> hot<00:03:36.720> water<00:03:36.959> heat<00:03:37.170> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
need to drain the hot water heat it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.610 
need to drain the hot water heat it
before<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.920> actually<00:03:39.200> remove<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.470> from

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
before we can actually remove it from

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.050 
before we can actually remove it from
the<00:03:40.830> basement<00:03:43.400> normally<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:44.519> would<00:03:44.670> put<00:03:44.879> a

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the basement normally we would put a

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.940 
the basement normally we would put a
