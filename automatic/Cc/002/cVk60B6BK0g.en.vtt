00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
the experience points even do so yeah I

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.360 
the experience points even do so yeah I
guess<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.580> got<00:05:34.910> all<00:05:35.030> my<00:05:35.060> things<00:05:35.570> out<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:35.960> way

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
guess I got all my things out of the way

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.460 
guess I got all my things out of the way
pretty<00:05:37.370> much<00:05:37.460> all<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.640> wanted<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.090> do<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:39.080> let

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
pretty much all I wanted to do so let

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.190 
pretty much all I wanted to do so let

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
move that back off screen so I guess

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.530 
move that back off screen so I guess
