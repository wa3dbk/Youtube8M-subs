00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:13.610
 Yes, this time is the introduction of the defeat deck of the mission of defeating Janemba guys. 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.950
 Foreword 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.650
 I wonder he was using at that play video 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.230
 It is this member 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.210
 Well say why put to have 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:34.690
 Yeah It is also the owner rely on the strength of luck Butchaken 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.690
 I've been to the numbers and I 'm a little confident about the charge impact, so here at 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.120
 A little 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 I thought I was going to raise the incidence rate I put this guy Yes 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 Well the movement of the first round is already 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.270
 Well at that time it is as videos anymore 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270
 At the top 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.780
 I Well suitable 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.160
 Mountain out to the other top doing this 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.400
 Even if it is put out at 2000, it changes to 3000 which is put at 3000, too 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.570
 Because fighting power does not go up 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.950
 And much hit by attack in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 Enter round 2 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.040
 Is all 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:23.700
 It is the top Yes it is out at the top 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.300
 Well, because the attacking business has been attacked twice in the first round, it has been viciously revived, so the energy gauge is 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300
 It is full 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.729
 And your opponent's hero by the ability of 6 turns new in the first round 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.400
 Energy has not accumulated in the first round 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.110
 Yes 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.110
 So it is unlikely that Janemba's units will be activated in round 2 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.930
 Well it is the best safety measure in later 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.510
 Oh my mission is anyway 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.870
 Nde devil 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.870
 It is all right if you don't even get rid of even the hero energy 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 I was well continue with this it is as videos Well in this 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:19.370
 Well I wonder why the hole was having a hard time 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.660
 It 's the first time I've done just to win 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.770
 myself 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.770
 If 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.190
 Well I say the secret of that doctor's doctor Mu and this vegeta gt 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.600
 It is those who say that do not have a secret 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.420
 At this vegeta gt 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.530
 Please change to this 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.920
 It is a reaction of super power 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.510
 It is the place of the third part of the rear doctor in that 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.410
 Janemba's elite type campaign will have spar rights 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.410
 Please try to change it 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.859
 The enemy of Biei has some of those patterns 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:09.129
 Probably so even in that day this large magic 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:10.080
 Without reservoir the hero Energy Some patterns come deathblow stuffy in that first round 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.210
 Oh dear 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.069
 Attack by attack 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.340
 I think also know those who went'll pattern Until Well now 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.540
 Even those who are being done 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.850
 Do you think you already know 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.080
 There are various patterns 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:35.360
 I think I do not have to use Doctor Mu 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.480
 Enemy hiro n child in the first round using the evil type elite type campaign of the bar 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.840
 Two 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.269
 Cormorants minute 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.450
 Like say 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.040
 There is some kind of evil in that case 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.819
 The bar 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.910
 To support area 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.930
 Because anyone who is already in the hatch hatch is good to put in 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.130
 Out at the time to combat force 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.640
 I was forced to faint and attacked, I got energy damage 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.850
 The 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.880
 The Well gauge or rather Well what more than to fill up that to a sound technique 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.700
 Yup 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.520
 Even that 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.520
 The rest is summer before summer 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.070
 It is exactly the same 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.790
 after 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.500
 You don't have to use it separately 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.940
 If you're doing well, you 'll be able to win over time 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:37.340
 Please change to Totepo 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.340
 This is a one-time special-skilled hit, yet the damage is tripled 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.670
 If that do not have this secret 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.080
 At Vegeta 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.350
 Change to the vegitator of superpower reaction 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.400
 To the place of Doctor mu 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.300
 Janemba's Baby's 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.990
 ag and type 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.740
 Janemba baby not 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.540
 Janemba elite type 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.240
 Cb sparking possessed person, try changing it 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.810
 Well try again 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.810
 Please give me 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.530
 Have 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.530
 Well I used it 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.809
 It is this member 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.810
 If you do not have a secret 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.080
 Base a choker of recoil of Vegeta Ku those who say that does not need a 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.860
 And gun 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:44.460
 If you do not have the secret of Dr. Mu in this place, it is a Janemba elite 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.460
 Write on the guy who has type campaign sparking 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:53.729
 At the end of the round one in Janemba 's ability, take away two homes of a scarlet a home 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.210
 Oh dear 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:02.620
 Party members is corps You know 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.620
 There is a pattern that can only save 4 hero energy in the round circle 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.280
 That time is already a chance Anyway 4 or more Hero Energy If you eat 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.060
 is 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.950
 The winning rate is quite 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.260
 It falls 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.400
 If this unit is used, the power of this member is 6 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.080
 It will be 1 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:29.110
 Transform after round 2 to boost power 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:32.430
 I think that there is only put members also doing so the person that I also use it ten 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:37.460
 There is only number 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.460
 The safest thing is to decide to kill 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.370
 Well I thought this was the safest solution 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.820
 previous 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.200
 Well requested by the killing of Janembagon 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.249
 With things 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.950
 So it was at the stage that I have not killed yet, so the other half 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:03.060
 Well, I feel like it doesn't matter 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.060
 I have not cleared 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.839
 I do not want you to request 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.200
 As it seemed to want you to introduce it 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.910
 A member of those days 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:27.980
 I think of things that focus on firepower 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:30.790
 I've introduced you to introduce those subdue a decent different anymore this time Yes 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.380
 I say again and again 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:36.060
 If you do not have Doctor 3 , Janemba 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.340
 Campaign of 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.600
 is not it 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.600
 Please use it 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.520
 Well myself 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.180
 with this 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.180
 You won 

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:54.389
 Key It is still to kill 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.180
 If you fought normally, you probably won't win
