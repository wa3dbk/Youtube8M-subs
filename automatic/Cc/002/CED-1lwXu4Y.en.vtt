00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
gun kills to unlock this so it's not

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
gun kills to unlock this so it's not
really<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.969> difficult<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.750> will<00:00:37.020> point<00:00:37.230> out

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
really that difficult I will point out

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
really that difficult I will point out
though<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> need<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.250> use<00:00:38.460> submachine<00:00:39.059> guns

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270

though you need to use submachine guns
the<00:00:39.450> AS<00:00:39.780> VAL<00:00:40.079> does<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:40.950> seem<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.250> work<00:00:41.430> at

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the AS VAL does not seem to work at

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
the AS VAL does not seem to work at
least<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> didn't<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.450> me<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
least it didn't for me so you have to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.250 
least it didn't for me so you have to
use<00:00:43.379> something<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.059> PDW<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> guess

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
use something like a PDW like I guess

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.049 
use something like a PDW like I guess
the<00:00:46.469> PDW<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.390> mp7<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.399> pp-2000<00:00:50.399> anything

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the PDW are the mp7 the pp-2000 anything

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
the PDW are the mp7 the pp-2000 anything
like<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.620> weapon<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
like that will get you this weapon and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
like that will get you this weapon and
it's<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.579> too<00:00:53.760> hard<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.180> 100<00:00:54.570> kills<00:00:54.750> just

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it's not too hard to get 100 kills just

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
it's not too hard to get 100 kills just
go<00:00:55.140> into<00:00:55.410> some<00:00:55.680> sort<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.949> giant<00:00:56.250> TDM<00:00:56.789> lobby

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
go into some sort of giant TDM lobby
grind<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.109> about<00:00:58.289> 20<00:00:58.620> minutes<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> before

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
grind for about 20 minutes and before

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830 
grind for about 20 minutes and before
you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.640> you'll<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.570> hunter

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you know it you'll have your hunter

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.039 
you know it you'll have your hunter
kills<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.579> pretty<00:01:02.579> simple<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> worth

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
kills so pretty simple but is it worth

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.570 
kills so pretty simple but is it worth
it<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.189> probably<00:01:05.280> asking

it I know you're probably asking

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.050 
it I know you're probably asking
yourself<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.299> worth<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> mp5k

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
yourself is it worth it is the mp5k

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
actually worth using well yes and no I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.370 
actually worth using well yes and no I
do<00:01:10.979> enjoy<00:01:11.280> using<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.299> him<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
do enjoy using that do like him it is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.920 
do enjoy using that do like him it is
exactly<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.430> same<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.970> mp7<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.630> feels

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
exactly the same as the mp7 it feels

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.350 
exactly the same as the mp7 it feels
like<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.100> only<00:01:17.700> difference<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
like that to me the only difference is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.710 
like that to me the only difference is
is<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.020> magazine<00:01:19.530> size<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.070> m5k<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:21.000> much

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
is the magazine size on this m5k is much

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.109 
is the magazine size on this m5k is much
much<00:01:22.140> smaller<00:01:22.400> even<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.640> extended<00:01:24.090> mags

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
much smaller even with extended mags

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.760 
much smaller even with extended mags
you're<00:01:24.450> still<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.200> 10<00:01:25.500> less

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you're still going to have 10 less

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
you're still going to have 10 less
rounds<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.939> will<00:01:27.390> point<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
rounds in this now I will point out that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
rounds in this now I will point out that
it<00:01:28.080> does<00:01:28.259> 20<00:01:28.650> damage<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:29.100> its<00:01:29.220> max<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it does 20 damage at its max so of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
it does 20 damage at its max so of
course<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> five<00:01:30.990> bullet

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
course it's going to be a five bullet

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.789 
course it's going to be a five bullet
kill<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> drops<00:01:32.130> off<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.600> 12.5<00:01:33.799> damage

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799

high fire rate all-purpose weapons in
the<00:01:44.490> game<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.990> does<00:01:46.259> hold<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.740> little<00:01:46.950> bit

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the game so it does hold a little bit

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.490 
the game so it does hold a little bit
more<00:01:47.520> damage<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.149> range<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.350> point

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
more damage at range but I will point

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
more damage at range but I will point
out<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.460> doing<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.119> know

out you don't want to be doing you know

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.880 
out you don't want to be doing you know
long<00:01:51.420> range<00:01:51.720> engagements<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.740> I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
long range engagements with this so I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.370 
long range engagements with this so I
don't<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.970> big<00:01:54.210> deal<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
don't really see that as a big deal you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.600 
don't really see that as a big deal you
know<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.710> gonna<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.979> an<00:01:56.040> Eightball<00:01:56.340> kill

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
know it's gonna be an Eightball kill

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.639 
know it's gonna be an Eightball kill
instead<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> 9-volt<00:01:57.509> kill<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.079> know<00:01:58.200> not

it's like if you're using this long

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's like if you're using this long
range<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.240> probably<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.719> using<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.140> right

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290

three people that are just lining up and

three people that are just lining up and
just<00:02:17.630> taking<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.080> same<00:02:18.260> bullet<00:02:18.530> over<00:02:18.800> and

just taking the same bullet over and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.650 
just taking the same bullet over and
over<00:02:19.040> because<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:19.910> thing<00:02:20.090> only<00:02:20.330> shoots<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
over because this thing only shoots the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.180 
over because this thing only shoots the
9-millimeter<00:02:21.290> doesn't<00:02:21.680> do<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.770> whole<00:02:21.860> lot<00:02:21.980> of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
9-millimeter doesn't do a whole lot of

9-millimeter doesn't do a whole lot of
damage<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.910> shoots<00:02:23.180> really<00:02:23.510> quick<00:02:23.780> that's<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
damage it shoots really quick that's the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.920 
damage it shoots really quick that's the
main<00:02:24.650> advantage<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.060> when<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.570> use<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.380 
main advantage you have when you use the
mp5<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:28.220> fact<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.730> should<00:02:28.910> really

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
mp5 is the fact that it should really

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.710 
mp5 is the fact that it should really
really<00:02:30.080> quick<00:02:30.440> it's<00:02:31.400> not<00:02:31.580> made<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.210> be<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.390> heavy

potential of this weapon now you're
probably<00:03:00.470> asking<00:03:00.680> yourself<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.400> worth

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
probably asking yourself is this worth

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.520 
probably asking yourself is this worth
using<00:03:01.820> over<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.330> mp7<00:03:02.600> even<00:03:03.200> though<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.410> you

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
using over the mp7 even though it you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.060 
using over the mp7 even though it you
know<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.740> does<00:03:03.920> do<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.130> extra<00:03:05.060> fraction<00:03:05.600> of

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
know it does do that extra fraction of

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.380 
know it does do that extra fraction of
damage<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.100> know<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.550> extra<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> think<00:03:08.270> it's

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
damage you know that extra I think it's

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.920 
damage you know that extra I think it's
what<00:03:08.600> an<00:03:08.780> extra<00:03:09.080> point<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.560> damage<00:03:10.750> hmm<00:03:11.750> i

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
what an extra point of damage hmm i

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.800 
what an extra point of damage hmm i
don't<00:03:12.140> know<00:03:12.320> i<00:03:12.350> still<00:03:12.709> prefer<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.370> mp7<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:14.030> to

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.870 
don't know i still prefer the mp7 I to
me<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.140> feels<00:03:15.440> right<00:03:15.950> because<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.550> does<00:03:16.700> have

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
me it feels right because it does have

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.790 
me it feels right because it does have
the<00:03:17.000> lecture<00:03:17.300> 10<00:03:17.510> rounds<00:03:17.930> I've<00:03:18.410> gotten<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.770> lot

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
the lecture 10 rounds I've gotten a lot

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.550 
the lecture 10 rounds I've gotten a lot
of<00:03:19.040> people<00:03:19.280> at<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.430> mp7<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.780> haven't<00:03:21.320> gotten<00:03:21.470> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
of people at the mp7 I haven't gotten a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.010 
of people at the mp7 I haven't gotten a
lot<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.800> people<00:03:22.010> damn<00:03:22.190> 5k<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:23.209> mean<00:03:23.870> it's

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
lot of people damn 5k so I mean it's

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.510 
lot of people damn 5k so I mean it's
really<00:03:24.170> comes<00:03:24.470> down<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.709> if<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.100> want<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.370> mix

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
really comes down to if you want to mix

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.430 
really comes down to if you want to mix
it<00:03:25.670> up<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.970> biggest<00:03:26.570> problem<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.110> my<00:03:27.260> eyes

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
it up the biggest problem in my eyes

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.240 
it up the biggest problem in my eyes
isn't<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:28.010> it's<00:03:28.160> outshine<00:03:28.700> by<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.170> mp7<00:03:30.250> it's

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
isn't that it's outshine by the mp7 it's

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.210 
isn't that it's outshine by the mp7 it's
that<00:03:31.489> it's<00:03:31.760> outshine<00:03:32.300> by<00:03:32.930> almost<00:03:33.320> every<00:03:33.920> close

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
that it's outshine by almost every close

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.850 
that it's outshine by almost every close
quarters<00:03:34.640> are<00:03:34.970> every<00:03:35.540> assault<00:03:36.260> rifle<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.680> this

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
quarters are every assault rifle in this

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.449 
quarters are every assault rifle in this
Coast<00:03:37.100> quarter<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:38.590> dealio<00:03:39.590> here<00:03:40.100> because

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
Coast quarter is a dealio here because

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.729 
Coast quarter is a dealio here because
you<00:03:40.550> got<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> AEK<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.600> got<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.989> f2000

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
you got like the AEK you got the f2000

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.010 
you got like the AEK you got the f2000
you<00:03:42.830> got<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.190> famas<00:03:43.640> you've<00:03:44.030> got<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.420> m16

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
you got the famas you've got the m16

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.380 
you got the famas you've got the m16
you've<00:03:45.260> got<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.590> m4<00:03:46.040> even<00:03:46.459> all<00:03:46.700> those<00:03:47.120> shoot

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
you've got the m4 even all those shoot

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.300 
you've got the m4 even all those shoot
really<00:03:47.780> quick<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.230> they<00:03:48.320> do<00:03:48.380> more<00:03:48.770> damage<00:03:49.010> up

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
really quick and they do more damage up

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.180 
really quick and they do more damage up
close<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:50.690> find<00:03:51.140> myself<00:03:51.320> getting<00:03:51.680> out<00:03:51.950> gun

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
close so I find myself getting out gun

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.190 
close so I find myself getting out gun
by<00:03:52.370> those<00:03:52.580> types<00:03:52.880> of<00:03:53.030> weapons<00:03:53.390> constantly

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
by those types of weapons constantly

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.590 
by those types of weapons constantly
when<00:03:54.440> using<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.770> m5<00:03:55.070> came<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.300> reason

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
when using the m5 came and the reason

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.240 
when using the m5 came and the reason
behind<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.020> just<00:03:57.440> because<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.739> feel<00:03:58.100> like

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
behind that is just because I feel like

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.550 
behind that is just because I feel like
there's<00:03:58.489> not<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> lot<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.000> balance<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.660> this<00:04:00.020> in

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
there's not a lot of balance in this in

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.990 
there's not a lot of balance in this in
these<00:04:01.040> close<00:04:01.250> quarters<00:04:01.280> maps<00:04:01.760> because

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
these close quarters maps because

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.970 
these close quarters maps because
there's<00:04:02.420> really<00:04:02.810> no<00:04:03.020> incentive<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.560> use<00:04:03.950> a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
there's really no incentive to use a

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.610 
there's really no incentive to use a
weapon<00:04:04.130> like<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:04.880> when<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.269> AEK<00:04:05.870> shoots

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
weapon like this when the AEK shoots

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.910 
weapon like this when the AEK shoots
just<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.130> fast<00:04:07.400> has<00:04:08.030> more<00:04:08.330> bullets<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.989> does

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
just as fast has more bullets and does

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.190 
just as fast has more bullets and does
more<00:04:10.160> damage<00:04:10.190> up<00:04:10.700> close<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:11.450> mean<00:04:11.840> granted

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
more damage up close so I mean granted

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.080 
more damage up close so I mean granted
these<00:04:12.410> do<00:04:12.680> have<00:04:12.709> better<00:04:13.190> hipfire<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:13.970> hip

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
these do have better hipfire and hip

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.050 
these do have better hipfire and hip
fire<00:04:14.300> is<00:04:14.690> very<00:04:15.530> important<00:04:16.070> on<00:04:16.160> these<00:04:16.400> maps<00:04:16.669> but

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
fire is very important on these maps but

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.300 
fire is very important on these maps but
to<00:04:17.870> me<00:04:18.020> I<00:04:18.049> just<00:04:18.440> found<00:04:18.590> that<00:04:18.890> some<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.220> these

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
to me I just found that some of these

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.069 
to me I just found that some of these
new<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.820> know

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
new you know

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.439 
new you know
these<00:04:20.289> POWs<00:04:20.680> don't<00:04:21.400> really<00:04:21.819> have<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> place<00:04:22.389> in

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
these POWs don't really have a place in

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.330 
these POWs don't really have a place in
close<00:04:22.870> quarters<00:04:23.199> you'd<00:04:23.379> think<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:24.069> being

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
close quarters you'd think that it being

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.360 
close quarters you'd think that it being
quote<00:04:24.819> close<00:04:25.300> quarters<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.949> would<00:04:27.129> be

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
quote close quarters that it would be

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.330 
quote close quarters that it would be
the<00:04:27.699> you<00:04:28.060> know<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.300> weapon<00:04:28.629> to<00:04:28.750> go<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.930> but

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
the you know the weapon to go to but

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.839 
the you know the weapon to go to but
honestly<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.580> high<00:04:30.759> fire<00:04:31.030> rate<00:04:31.300> high<00:04:31.539> damage

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
honestly the high fire rate high damage

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.399 
honestly the high fire rate high damage
assault<00:04:33.849> rifles<00:04:34.180> outshine<00:04:34.870> these<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> lot<00:04:35.289> of

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
assault rifles outshine these a lot of

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.020 
assault rifles outshine these a lot of
times<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.770> that's<00:04:35.830> unfortunate<00:04:36.039> so<00:04:36.669> I'd<00:04:36.879> like

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
times and that's unfortunate so I'd like

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.820 
times and that's unfortunate so I'd like
to<00:04:37.150> see<00:04:37.270> dice<00:04:37.539> give<00:04:37.840> these<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.139> just<00:04:38.199> maybe<00:04:38.650> a

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
to see dice give these and just maybe a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.469 
to see dice give these and just maybe a
little<00:04:39.009> bit<00:04:39.219> of<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.430> buff<00:04:39.639> to<00:04:39.879> kind<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.210> compete

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
little bit of a buff to kind of compete

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.020 
little bit of a buff to kind of compete
a<00:04:40.539> little<00:04:40.930> bit<00:04:41.050> more<00:04:41.340> here<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.520> coming

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
a little bit more here in the coming

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.779 
a little bit more here in the coming
coming<00:04:43.870> weeks<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.560> feel<00:04:44.860> like<00:04:44.949> a<00:04:44.979> buff<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.490> some

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
coming weeks I feel like a buff on some

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.969 
coming weeks I feel like a buff on some
of<00:04:45.879> the<00:04:45.939> PDW<00:04:46.509> would<00:04:46.659> really<00:04:47.050> make<00:04:47.199> them<00:04:47.439> more

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
of the PDW would really make them more

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.100 
of the PDW would really make them more
advantageous<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.849> use<00:04:49.090> maybe<00:04:49.599> give<00:04:49.840> them<00:04:50.020> a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
advantageous to use maybe give them a

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.100 
advantageous to use maybe give them a
very<00:04:50.379> sharp<00:04:50.680> drop-off<00:04:51.539> whereas<00:04:52.539> like<00:04:52.750> really

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
very sharp drop-off whereas like really

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.629 
very sharp drop-off whereas like really
up<00:04:53.199> close<00:04:53.229> it's<00:04:53.680> still<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:53.949> four-block<00:04:54.370> kill

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
up close it's still a four-block kill

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.089
