00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:01.939
 Joint 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.050
 I was also 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.050
 I entered the server 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.519
 Otani became 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.449
 It was awful 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.650
 I can hit a bat 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.619
 The person who sees the figure for the first time 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.039
 I'm confused 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.849
 Also be done with friends 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.439
 I do not know how to get out of the start 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.260
 It is not a factor like alternative horse racing 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.760
 This too 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.880
 I have been wondering for a long time 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.700
 It is written like this 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.830
 That's it 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.650
 The reason is 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.870
 To us 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.989
 Placed in Montreal, Canada, a major weakness 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.620
 It is hard to say that it is hard to say that the training on the general chart 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.339
 Mizuno wave can't stay 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.180
 I'll be there again 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.650
 We 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.469
 It can not be rising in any way 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.520
 Why 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.590
 Because I told you that I want to 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.540
 An amount that we can be convinced that we were in agreement 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.280
 is not 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.880
 I'm sorry 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.100
 You were looking at it was side by side 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.880
 For example, you can get rid of just being in the wind 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.020
 In addition, the remaining battery capacity is up to a fixed value 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.690
 I can not stop- 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.020
 Develop as a support group 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 Start bedridden at the entertainer start line 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.440
 The wine red method is adopted 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.310
 A fire starts in the morning 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.490
 Multiple answers 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.420
 My heart accelerates when my heart comes out 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.040
 Then I talked about taking part in love ost 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.040
 There is no cause for each company after examination by the city 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.380
 279 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.260
 01st 1750 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.380
 In the race again 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.950
 One big one 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 I just follow the customer 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.450
 It ends in about three weeks 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.520
 I wanted to come back again 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.080
 It can be said that it is new once it gets nervous 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.069
 The Nikkei average ended with a big rebound 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.039
 During that 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.369
 Because it becomes a conventional crystal 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.689
 The event will be refunded for all ships involved after the entire period 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:16.540
 Also to the players 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.789
 There will be a tough alitee 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:20.879
 That's the theory 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.769
 Mr. Hiroya who will tell you no matter how good your grades are 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.269
 I will not be able to go to the north race for a while after that 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.519
 The penguin's in the old calendar showing the ability that he 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.589
 Favorite things 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.809
 Tomorrow is painful now, but I think it will be advantageous with sushi 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.099
 Joint 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.339
 It seemed like I had started flying 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.269
 As long as it can be estimated to be the top racer 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.400
 Not to be as much of us 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.469
 It has not entered the rainy season 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.189
 dynamite
