we know that ultraviolet induced tans
are<00:00:02.100> dangerous<00:00:02.520> but<00:00:03.030> what<00:00:03.210> about<00:00:03.419> tans<00:00:03.750> from

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
are dangerous but what about tans from

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.559 
are dangerous but what about tans from
self<00:00:04.380> tanners<00:00:04.799> can<00:00:05.400> they<00:00:05.490> also<00:00:05.700> be<00:00:05.879> dangerous
