00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.070

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.670
 Come on the cell phone and half of the blog is here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.430
 so I have gmail here has a lot 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.159
 that it is necessary to see that there are many 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.450
 Good, there, the social networks is all this. 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:44.909
 so the first one I have the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:45.899
 instagram and a description of their networks 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.619
 social 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.299
 There I have the esc and it's where you 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:57.600
 ask lots of questions 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:00.810
 It's got a lot of questions in 1980 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.700
 questions there I have facebook face 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.560
 You least like it because if I could 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.079
 I would not have just afraid that they have groups 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.350
 of my school in the type space with the 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:14.480
 teachers they pass task 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.540
 groups then I need to have but did not want to 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.400
 have that face and then I have inep 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.070

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.780
 I have warned a lot of things to

 You and I will take the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.110
 drum from when you do not know much 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.610
 time trying and and I think our mother 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.060
 also in the description if you want 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.940
 I still think I have it but I have it 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.440
 many posts I love is also with 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.630
 sure one of my success 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.620
 Preferred because I love him so much. 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.930
 twitter 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.190
 I've tried bigger with you guys 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.660
 twitter, I already told my mother that I 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.820
 I have done is that you can follow that 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.500
 We talk there but they are very 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.570
 few people talk to him about 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.490
 text actually started as cruel than 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.400
 I for the inep but never start by 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.190
 twitter twitter to dollar start there 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.780
 so if you're 30, tell yourself too 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.490
 that I 'm always talking to lines 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:28.970
 pro so then I have just the tap 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:31.880
 why not also the top ii and there I have 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.040
 o in hobbit which is a photo application 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.480
 and I only have here on my cell phone type 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.780
 that's also what I have in my 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.920
 cell phone because I like to get it well 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.510
 ground, this one, here, here. 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.780
 wrong is a lot 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.000
 so it's now useful that they are not so 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.980
 so the first thing you have 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.990
 a little game the west team I had 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.090
 another cell phone just because it was not connected 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:01.250
 num in the face I lost all 64 levels 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.070
 I already played then I'm on level 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.200
 0 when I started playing there again I 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.730
 I have shazam, I think everyone 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.680
 know is not right but it is an application 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.140
 very good if you do not know or 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.990
 explain how it works 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.520
 This is how you are playing a song that 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.190
 you put your sound box 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.340
 cell phone in front of the speaker and the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.680
 playing music 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.449
 and he picks up the music and it does not even have to be 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.340
 necessarily in the acoustic sound box 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.090
 playing music in the middle and put the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.729
 cell phone 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.030
 He picks up I already tried He's already got me 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.250
 music like that and he's very good super 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.260
 I recommend this app is very useful 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.500
 Then I have the infinite jacques in the 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.240
 true 80 checks enfinity and it is a 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.910
 application that has I have to show 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.669
 mine not my registration here but he is a 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.530
 the playlist application then this 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.240
 search genre of music you want 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.910
 listen to it gives you a lot of play list 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.830
 with songs of this money to see you 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.110
 and for you to hear your music if you dispute 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.000
 in the whole period that I think there 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.010
 very cool, I always listen to music there 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.090
 I discover new music from bands 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.540
 new ones too 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.669
 and then I have netflix because right because 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.669
 not have netflix and I like 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:19.710
 floribella some tips and I have 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:21.090
 netflix on my cell phone too and there I have it 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.580
 google translate 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:31.080
 I think it's useful so sometimes you have to 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:33.090
 spanish language I have is photos 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.400
 I do not know how to edit the photos myself 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.120
 I have after light an insight I came 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.880
 cook 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:45.750
 so come on I'll take a picture of you 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:48.120
 you and take a picture 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.520
 After all this time, that's when I go to 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.389
 guess with the pipe that this first 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.130
 application and I add not grip 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:00.450
 go alone and choose photo wants 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:03.300
 add squeeze on website had and will 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.710
 here has some non-effects 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.599
 There is a lot but this is what I think 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.729
 we will have effects that I like the most 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:19.669
 so I always only use it so I 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:19.669
 I choose a black feat I'm going to use b1 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.639
 and then he has another way and 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.409
 you can do 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:38.710
 to tamper with my photo contract on 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:42.610
 clarity and I love it because I 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.770
 I always move and I just love 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.969
 this business of handling quality is 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.219
 off the light 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.680
 I think I find it easier to do. 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:56.439
 It's still one and there's only you save the 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:59.979
 photo there you tighten nuno right always 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:10.979
 the camera camera breaks with that same 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:10.979
 consumer and there was the instagram photo 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.090
 and that's what you have on your cell phone 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.849
 so I hope you like it more 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.289
 I have songs that have all that but 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.240
 practically only application that I have 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:27.009
 My cell phone, I hope you have 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.960
 liked the video if you liked this one 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:32.909
 Delicate do not know much helps me 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.909
 Your kiss until next Christmas.
