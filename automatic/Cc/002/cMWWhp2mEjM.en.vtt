00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.090
 this is in the first slope of the shore 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:39.750
 left of the big corridors 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:42.989
 the group that traced this morning had the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.320
 good idea to make a hole my little 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:53.300
 stratigraphy so there a little bit of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:56.570
 fresh snow all that and it's all hard 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.940
 down to the bottom he tried with the boat 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.309
 lasts until tomorrow well uniform 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.330
 that's what I can say but he 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.250
 should there lipids a little more 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.470
 thorough with the necessary tools 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.259
 and just like that it's good we see 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.310
 than one meter of snow 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.310
 cold past 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.090
 it's stable but hey we can be wrong 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.560
 of course, but from the coach of Italy 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.110
 patches of hard snow that's true but 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.910
 Well, there I am, we saw people there 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.290
 that one digs and in battle him either 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.110
 evoked it's you she crossed all 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.430
 both yeah my bare back and the party to 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.050
 heart this morning ah that's it but that 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.460
 seems not bad but it's just the bottom 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:07.479
 that there is a little we do not know but 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.110
 mauges no effect this coat plate 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.300
 no sign of plates that sank 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.660
 frankly risk 2 years + risk of 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.800
 give in on the other Persian I think that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.630
 you have a good idea to make yourself 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:29.290
 a nice trace yes it was actually there 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.290
 it's not bad that gnaws at seeing them 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.050
 go see no but that's it 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.519
 same unit that you have a moment 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.690
 that the snow has fallen now too 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.070
 good it is true that they argue that they 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.070
 risk of being able to these points 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.799
 you will sleep at the shelter at his mother's 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:04.190
 that's good you got on foot from 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:12.440
 the after bongo surely made a combo 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:15.650
 in any case for the trace nick wey it's 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.019
 well because there the trace to the aisles a 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.069
 can be a tender like France and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:24.290
 expectations but at times it crashes 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.650
 but behind we wait for postal terminals 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.250
 and all four together go 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.250
 eat the molding December too 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.069
 the attacks 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.440
 a stop 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.240
 ah good 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:21.050
 here it was west face the big ones 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.320
 corridors 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:30.470
 the big class to the big breakage 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:32.850
 how much his calculations the first 1150 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:37.620
 how many m that's so much had a 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:44.910
 big box of 1200 2300 meters of 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:46.530
 elevation difference super condition nickel all 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.850
 alone at the top of the mountain just for 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:54.200
 we a little couple who made us a 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.200
 big big part of the route 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.790
 as for houston 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.020
 to crack 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.380
 and an amazing sunset 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.910
 it's possible
