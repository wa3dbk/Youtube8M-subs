electrical<00:00:01.070> discharges<00:00:02.070> from<00:00:02.280> an<00:00:02.460> electric

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
electrical discharges from an electric

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.419 
electrical discharges from an electric
eel<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.419> can<00:00:03.689> also<00:00:03.840> use<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:07.099> listen<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.340> the

eel you can also use it to listen to the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.490 
eel you can also use it to listen to the
lecture<00:00:09.000> which<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.269> discharges<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.260> other

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:21.319 

I<00:03:16.549> use<00:03:17.549> shish<00:03:17.849> kabob<00:03:18.180> sticks<00:03:19.939> you<00:03:20.939> can<00:03:20.969> break

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
I use shish kabob sticks you can break

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.420 
I use shish kabob sticks you can break
you<00:03:21.689> should<00:03:21.750> break<00:03:22.139> off<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.889> pointed

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
you should break off the the pointed

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.699 
you should break off the the pointed
edge<00:03:23.669> just<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.569> case<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.930> might<00:03:25.079> poke<00:03:25.379> them<00:03:25.560> by

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
edge just in case you might poke them by

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.520 
edge just in case you might poke them by
my<00:03:26.249> mistake<00:03:26.430> or<00:03:26.819> something<00:03:26.969> like<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.530> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
my mistake or something like that you

my mistake or something like that you
got<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.739> be<00:03:28.769> very<00:03:28.829> careful<00:03:29.340> with<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:30.139> and<00:03:31.139> I

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
got to be very careful with that and I

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
on the safe side on my second video I'll

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.050 
on the safe side on my second video I'll
show<00:03:52.469> you<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.739> supply<00:03:53.099> feed<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.760> how<00:03:54.000> to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
show you the supply feed it and how to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.209 
show you the supply feed it and how to
set<00:03:54.389> this<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.560> way<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.769> can<00:03:56.010> listen

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.219 
set this up so that way you can listen

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.759 
set this up so that way you can listen
to<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.549> electrical<00:03:57.180> discharges<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.680> are

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
to the electrical discharges that are

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.359 
to the electrical discharges that are
produced<00:03:59.129> from<00:03:59.280> any<00:03:59.519> electrical<00:04:00.090> fish
