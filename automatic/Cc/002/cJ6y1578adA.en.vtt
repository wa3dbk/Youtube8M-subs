really dispose of it until someone got

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.550 
really dispose of it until someone got
the<00:01:38.310> idea<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.030> making<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> nutritional

am mildly lactose intolerant and I get

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.079 
am mildly lactose intolerant and I get
gas<00:05:50.500> if<00:05:50.740> I<00:05:50.860> drink<00:05:51.039> a<00:05:51.219> couple<00:05:51.399> glasses<00:05:51.580> of<00:05:51.879> milk

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:52.089 
gas if I drink a couple glasses of milk

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:53.909 
gas if I drink a couple glasses of milk
or<00:05:52.270> drink<00:05:52.509> a<00:05:52.599> protein<00:05:52.779> shake<00:05:53.319> you<00:05:53.589> don't<00:05:53.770> want

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
or drink a protein shake you don't want

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
to be in a room with me two hours later

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.700 
to be in a room with me two hours later
so<00:05:58.330> those<00:05:58.569> are<00:05:58.599> just<00:05:58.779> points<00:05:59.139> to<00:05:59.229> consider<00:05:59.379> and

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
so those are just points to consider and

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.700 
so those are just points to consider and
I<00:05:59.740> do<00:05:59.800> find<00:06:00.219> it<00:06:00.339> interesting<00:06:00.490> how<00:06:01.680> basically<00:06:02.680> a

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
I do find it interesting how basically a
