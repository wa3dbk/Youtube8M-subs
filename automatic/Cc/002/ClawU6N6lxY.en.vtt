00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.399
 benigni buys followo solo sail 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.639
 lol limewire 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.639
 love you tube 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.149
 we have 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.149
 the thought 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.199
 the harquebus in question is another of the Leopardian traps devised 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.529
 two poachers to capture the Turks 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.880
 in practice as seen from the images 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 have been applied to art 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.960
 to the scale 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.270
 2 snails of which the thrush need you. 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.760
 as the thrush if 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.130
 an animal that has evolved over time to the traps of poachers 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 the problem occurred that no longer entered the cages 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 but try to eat around the cage if there is anything 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.670
 some isca 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.150
 that does not harm him 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.640
 in this case instead we used one 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.390
 do not have to take hard and mouse diodes for catching mustelids 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 suitably modified 2 see 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.810
 especially um 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.900
 a device loved to snap 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.380
 his heart positioned fishing with a connected scale 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.470
 to this type of support 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.470
 here it is 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.260
 this is the weight scale 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.730
 the snails copy this waiting position 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.820
 in this case, everything does not enter the cage completely 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 is positioned at this point 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.670
 now let's take 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.840
 a piece of wood the size of a thrush and we support it here 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.710
 naturally we go to water we go to arm 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.390
 capracotta 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.390
 we remove the safety hook 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.900
 we have armed 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.810
 the pappus 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.050
 this world 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.139
 with a concept, bilancina that then 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.139
 2 snails are connected 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.399
 the thrush within the cage 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.649
 and tries to break through with its beak 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:20.429
 the cd comes out 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.369
 the coca-king shell of the snail 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.159
 trying to take it outside 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.159
 the moment he starts pulling 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.139
 the snails are activated 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:37.389
 but in a tenth of a second the trap pushing hard 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.089
 the animal inside the 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:41.669
 it burns its heart 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.129
 with a slap in the back 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.619
 very powerful hahaha 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.619

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:29.150
