00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
actually zoom it out you can actually

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.150 
actually zoom it out you can actually
see<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.560> side<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> door

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
see on the right side of the door

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.669 
see on the right side of the door
there's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.640> poster<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:31.170> appears<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> be

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
there's a poster of what appears to be

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.250 
there's a poster of what appears to be
spring-trap<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> lot<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.079> say

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
spring-trap and I know a lot of you say

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.209 
spring-trap and I know a lot of you say
you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.530> could<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.710> golden<00:00:35.040> Bonnie

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you know that could be golden Bonnie

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.479 
you know that could be golden Bonnie
that<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.180> golden<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.399> it's

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
that can be golden I think I think it's

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
that can be golden I think I think it's
just<00:00:38.579> normal<00:00:38.879> spring-trap<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
just normal spring-trap but it's kind of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
just normal spring-trap but it's kind of
weird<00:00:40.379> how<00:00:40.500> Scott<00:00:41.489> decided<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> add<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.360> into

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
weird how Scott decided to add this into

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
weird how Scott decided to add this into
the<00:00:42.719> game<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.559> make<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.040> where<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.219> can

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the game but not make it to where we can

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
the game but not make it to where we can
see<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.510> game<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.989> can't<00:00:46.350> zoom

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
see it because in game you can't zoom

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
see it because in game you can't zoom
out<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> camera<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.610> stuck

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
out the camera you know it's stuck

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.029 
out the camera you know it's stuck
zoomed<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> door<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.649> there's<00:00:49.770> no<00:00:49.890> way

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
zoomed in on the door so there's no way

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.590 
zoomed in on the door so there's no way
of<00:00:50.070> us<00:00:50.250> possibly<00:00:50.730> seeing<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.090> unless<00:00:51.420> we

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
of us possibly seeing this unless we

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569 
of us possibly seeing this unless we
went<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> game<00:00:52.170> files<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.800> might<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
went into the game files so might as I

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.950 
went into the game files so might as I
guess<00:00:53.730> I'd<00:00:53.879> say<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> camera<00:00:54.809> was

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
guess I'd say this is how the camera was

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
guess I'd say this is how the camera was
supposed<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> look<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> maybe<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.270> in

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
supposed to look and maybe just like in

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.540 
supposed to look and maybe just like in
the<00:00:57.600> next<00:00:57.750> picture<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.739> isn't<00:00:59.100> supposed<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the next picture this isn't supposed to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.650 
the next picture this isn't supposed to
always<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.149> supposed<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.629> a

little<00:01:13.110> bit<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.290> sitting<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.710> we've

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
little bit more sitting because we've

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.090 
little bit more sitting because we've
seen<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.970> hallway<00:01:15.180> before<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.650> don't

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
seen this hallway before and I don't

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.679 
seen this hallway before and I don't
know<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.240> said<00:01:18.270> before<00:01:18.509> this

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
know if this like I said before this

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.030 
know if this like I said before this
could<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.990> something<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.259> Scott<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.619> gonna

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
could be something that Scott was gonna

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.399 
could be something that Scott was gonna
add<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.330> he<00:01:21.420> decided<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> because

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
we're gonna find something out about him

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.230 
we're gonna find something out about him
pretty<00:02:01.860> soon<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.189> least<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> hope<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.119> we

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pretty soon at least I hope but we

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
pretty soon at least I hope but we
really<00:02:03.450> don't<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.719> basically<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:05.340> image

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
really don't know basically this image

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.550 
really don't know basically this image
he's<00:02:06.090> missing<00:02:06.719> his<00:02:06.840> right<00:02:06.869> eye<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.439> some

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
he's missing his right eye for some

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.990 
he's missing his right eye for some
reason<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.160> he's<00:02:08.250> either<00:02:08.369> blinking<00:02:08.879> at

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
reason I think he's either blinking at

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.770 
reason I think he's either blinking at
the<00:02:09.030> camera

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the camera

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.330 
the camera
I<00:02:09.810> couldn't<00:02:10.140> me<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> previous<00:02:11.099> image

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
I couldn't me see in the previous image

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.490 
I couldn't me see in the previous image
and<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.569> two<00:02:12.690> different<00:02:12.810> poses<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and it's two different poses so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140 
and it's two different poses so
could<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:13.770> be<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.070> simply<00:02:14.430> blinking<00:02:14.910> at

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
could just be like simply blinking at

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.540 
could just be like simply blinking at
whatever<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.140> know<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.530> image<00:02:16.680> or<00:02:17.010> he

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
whatever you know in that image or he

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.860 
whatever you know in that image or he
could<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.790> missing<00:02:18.210> his<00:02:18.300> right<00:02:18.330> now<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> don't

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
could be missing his right now I don't

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.990 
could be missing his right now I don't
know<00:02:19.020> what's<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.680> also<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
know what's up with that also the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.790 
know what's up with that also the
background<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.570> his<00:02:21.660> eyes<00:02:21.810> black<00:02:22.170> unlike<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
background of his eyes black unlike the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440 
background of his eyes black unlike the
other<00:02:22.980> pictures<00:02:23.400> where<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.940> white<00:02:24.120> they

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
other pictures where it's white they

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.170 
other pictures where it's white they
have<00:02:24.540> white<00:02:25.280> white<00:02:26.280> backgrounds<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.030> their

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
have white white backgrounds for their

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.120 
have white white backgrounds for their
eyes<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.450> what<00:02:27.630> you'd<00:02:27.780> call<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.710> his<00:02:28.980> is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
eyes on what you'd call that but his is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.770 
eyes on what you'd call that but his is
black<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.730> those<00:02:29.790> eyes<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.240> actually<00:02:30.510> white

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
black and those eyes are actually white

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.480 
black and those eyes are actually white
so<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.320> reversed<00:02:31.860> which<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.250> kind<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490
