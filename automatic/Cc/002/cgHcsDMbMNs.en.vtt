refrigerator<00:00:29.260> coils<00:00:29.560> actually<00:00:30.279> help<00:00:30.490> the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
refrigerator coils actually help the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.450 
refrigerator coils actually help the
refrigerator<00:00:31.210> cool<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:32.290> if<00:00:32.439> there's<00:00:32.769> too

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
refrigerator cool and if there's too

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.340 
refrigerator cool and if there's too
much<00:00:33.489> dirt<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.180> dust<00:00:34.360> on<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.690> coils<00:00:35.110> that

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
much dirt and dust on the coils that

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.310 
much dirt and dust on the coils that
makes<00:00:35.710> it<00:00:35.920> too<00:00:36.610> hard<00:00:36.880> and<00:00:37.149> eventually<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
makes it too hard and eventually the

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.770 
makes it too hard and eventually the
refrigerator<00:00:38.860> will

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
refrigerator will

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.270 
refrigerator will
so<00:00:41.170> we<00:00:41.380> want<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.650> take<00:00:41.830> care<00:00:42.040> of<00:00:42.160> those

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
so we want to take care of those

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.100 
so we want to take care of those
refrigerator<00:00:42.940> coils<00:00:43.180> make<00:00:43.600> sure<00:00:43.720> we<00:00:43.870> get<00:00:43.960> the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
refrigerator coils make sure we get the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
refrigerator coils make sure we get the
most<00:00:44.260> out<00:00:44.560> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.430 

you

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.000 

located<00:01:01.400> underneath<00:01:01.670> here<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.239> can<00:01:02.450> see<00:01:03.010> that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
located underneath here you can see that

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.010 
located underneath here you can see that
they're<00:01:04.220> all<00:01:04.250> covered<00:01:04.970> with<00:01:05.000> dust<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.810> it's

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
they're all covered with dust and it's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.870 
they're all covered with dust and it's
like<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.260> blanket<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:06.979> there<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.370> keeps<00:01:07.550> them

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
like a blanket on there that keeps them

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.590 
like a blanket on there that keeps them
hot<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.260> want<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.560> get<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.830> blanket<00:01:10.340> off

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
hot so you want to get that blanket off

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.109 
hot so you want to get that blanket off
so<00:01:11.600> you'll<00:01:11.810> take<00:01:12.020> there's<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.890> brush<00:01:13.790> that's

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
so you'll take there's a brush that's

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.780 
so you'll take there's a brush that's
made<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.170> can<00:01:15.380> go<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.950> gently<00:01:16.490> clean

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
made that you can go in and gently clean

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.460 
made that you can go in and gently clean
all<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.030> these<00:01:17.270> coils<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.900> clean<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.260> dust

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
all of these coils you clean the dust

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.540 
all of these coils you clean the dust
off<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:18.979> then<00:01:19.040> you'll<00:01:19.700> take<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:19.970> shot<00:01:20.360> back

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
off and then you'll take the shot back

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.570 
off and then you'll take the shot back
and<00:01:23.080> suck<00:01:24.080> all<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.619> dirt<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.130> rock<00:01:25.280> up

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
and suck all of that dirt and rock up

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.310 
and suck all of that dirt and rock up
and<00:01:25.880> there's<00:01:26.300> no<00:01:26.450> telling<00:01:26.750> what<00:01:26.900> other<00:01:27.050> kind

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
and there's no telling what other kind

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.790 
and there's no telling what other kind
of<00:01:27.380> things<00:01:27.470> you'll<00:01:27.770> find<00:01:27.800> underneath<00:01:28.369> there

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.069 

we<00:01:33.800> get<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.979> lot<00:01:34.190> of<00:01:34.310> dust<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:34.789> dirt<00:01:34.880> whoo

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.410 

much<00:01:41.710> more<00:01:41.979> important<00:01:42.490> because<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:43.119> hair

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
much more important because that hair

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.310 
much more important because that hair
gets<00:01:43.979> collected<00:01:44.979> on<00:01:45.520> those<00:01:45.729> coils<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.570> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
gets collected on those coils and the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.190 
gets collected on those coils and the
airflow<00:01:47.710> goes<00:01:48.329> through<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.450> front<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.020> and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
airflow goes through the front of it and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.139 
airflow goes through the front of it and
then<00:01:50.380> up<00:01:50.590> around<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.100> back<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.850> actually

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
then up around the back so it actually

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.330 
then up around the back so it actually
sucks<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.049> dirt<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.409> dust<00:01:53.560> from<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:53.979> front

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
sucks the dirt and dust from the front

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:04.770 
sucks the dirt and dust from the front
of<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.579> refrigerator

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.630 

so<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.080> work<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.590> get<00:02:06.740> get<00:02:07.159> as<00:02:07.369> best

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
so you just work and you get get as best

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.520 
so you just work and you get get as best
as<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:07.880> can<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.720> doesn't<00:02:08.959> have<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.410> be

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
as you can it doesn't have to be

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.370 
as you can it doesn't have to be
pristine<00:02:10.510> but<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.660> do<00:02:11.810> want<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.080> get<00:02:12.230> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
pristine but you do want to get the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.930 
pristine but you do want to get the
majority<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> dust<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.489> dirt<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.700> you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
majority of the dust and dirt that you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.059 
majority of the dust and dirt that you
can<00:02:14.180> off<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.050> coil<00:02:15.319> centering<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.860> cost

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
can off of the coil centering the cost

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:24.020 
can off of the coil centering the cost
of<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.370> new<00:02:16.520> refrigerator<00:02:16.819> it's<00:02:17.540> well<00:02:17.810> worth<00:02:18.020> it

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.080 

that's<00:02:24.570> beauty<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.830> sits<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.820> that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
that's beauty that sits up to that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:36.110 
that's beauty that sits up to that
surprised<00:02:27.510> me<00:02:27.810> yeah
