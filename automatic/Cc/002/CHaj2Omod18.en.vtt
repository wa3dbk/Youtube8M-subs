going to be changing a little bit and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.609 
going to be changing a little bit and
for<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.760> time<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.500> always

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
for that time in that we're always

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
being and that day will represent a lot
