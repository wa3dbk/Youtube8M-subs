00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the internet i thought well what's the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.950 
the internet i thought well what's the
point<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:44.760> would<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.030> fall<00:00:45.059> apart<00:00:45.420> anyway

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
point I it would all fall apart anyway

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
point I it would all fall apart anyway
as<00:00:46.140> things<00:00:46.739> usually<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.329> them

as things usually do when I make them
but<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.559> did<00:00:49.739> look<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> further<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
but I did look into it further and I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.600 
but I did look into it further and I
hadn't<00:00:52.020> realized<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> depth<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.980> training

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
