00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
color and we're going to making these

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.840 
color and we're going to making these
four<00:01:27.990> squares<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.829> these<00:01:28.950> squares<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.520> two

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
four squares and these squares are two

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.940 
four squares and these squares are two
by<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.930> you'll<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.170> using<00:01:31.470> four<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> them

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
by two so you'll be using four of them

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
by two so you'll be using four of them
and<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> start<00:01:33.000> wherever

and you're just going to start wherever

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740 
and you're just going to start wherever
and<00:01:34.049> you're<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:35.060> one<00:01:36.060> square<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and you're going to do one square and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.730 
and you're going to do one square and
then<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.979> upper<00:01:38.570> left<00:01:39.570> another<00:01:40.320> square

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
then to the upper left another square

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
then to the upper left another square
and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> skip<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.000> line

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and then you're going to skip one line

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
and then you're going to skip one line
and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.229> another<00:01:43.530> square<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:44.850> go

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and then do another square and then go

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
and then do another square and then go
to<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.509> bottom<00:01:46.020> left<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:46.890> ahead<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to the bottom left and go ahead and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.550 
to the bottom left and go ahead and
connect<00:01:47.520> another<00:01:47.759> square<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
connect another square right here so you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.929 
connect another square right here so you
