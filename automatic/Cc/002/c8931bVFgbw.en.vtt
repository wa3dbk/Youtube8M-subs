00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
as you can see you guys extracting and

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.520 
as you can see you guys extracting and
as<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.160> see<00:03:20.400> since<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.150> expected<00:03:21.780> here<00:03:22.290> is

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
as you can see since I expected here is

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.130 
as you can see since I expected here is
certain<00:03:22.950> circulator<00:03:23.489> right<00:03:23.820> here<00:03:24.120> um<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.019> this

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
certain circulator right here um so this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.620 
certain circulator right here um so this
is<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.410> file<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.670> run<00:03:26.850> certain<00:03:27.120> simular

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
is the file for to run certain simular

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.050 
is the file for to run certain simular
so<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:27.989> working<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.739> operating<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.910> it's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
so that's working and operating so it's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.030 
so that's working and operating so it's
proof<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.660> works<00:03:30.840> we're<00:03:31.560> just<00:03:31.680> gonna<00:03:31.769> put

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
proof that it works we're just gonna put

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.190 
proof that it works we're just gonna put
all<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.220> those<00:03:32.459> aside<00:03:32.910> we're<00:03:33.570> gonna<00:03:33.690> double

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
all of those aside we're gonna double

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.990 
all of those aside we're gonna double
click<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:35.269> gotta<00:03:36.269> wait<00:03:36.450> till<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.750> loads<00:03:38.000> yeah

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
click it gotta wait till it loads yeah

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.410 
click it gotta wait till it loads yeah
okay<00:03:39.720> as<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.380> see<00:03:40.500> certain<00:03:40.980> signal<00:03:41.310> are

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
okay as you can see certain signal are

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.660 
okay as you can see certain signal are
configuration<00:03:42.420> now<00:03:42.989> what<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> recommend<00:03:43.980> if

leggy and when you open it because since

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.480 
leggy and when you open it because since
that<00:04:31.460> like<00:04:31.820> everything<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.690> like<00:04:32.930> new<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.220> your

lagging because my computer is getting
used<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.150> surgeon<00:04:47.570> simulator<00:04:47.780> being

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
used to surgeon simulator being

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.570 
used to surgeon simulator being
installed<00:04:48.940> on<00:04:49.940> my<00:04:50.180> computer<00:04:50.320> so<00:04:51.320> as<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.460> can
