taking so long to load up for some

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.830 
taking so long to load up for some
reason<00:01:56.040> okay<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.060> override<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.600> terrain

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
reason okay it will override the terrain

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
reason okay it will override the terrain
doubtless<00:01:58.290> automatically<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.310> worry

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
doubtless automatically so don't worry

doubtless automatically so don't worry
you<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.229> override<00:02:01.920> thingy

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
you don't have to do the override thingy

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
texture pack and it will be so cool so

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.400 
texture pack and it will be so cool so
once<00:04:03.360> that's<00:04:03.540> all<00:04:03.780> right<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.230> done

the name into the file it is in the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.469 
the name into the file it is in the
files<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.979> know<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.220> seems<00:04:17.400> confusing<00:04:17.789> let<00:04:18.390> me

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
files I know that seems confusing let me

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.390 
files I know that seems confusing let me
just<00:04:18.630> put<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.959> smaller<00:04:19.200> way<00:04:19.380> get<00:04:20.250> that

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
just put it in a smaller way get that

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.090 
just put it in a smaller way get that
file<00:04:20.609> copy<00:04:21.419> or<00:04:21.780> paste<00:04:22.289> there<00:04:22.500> were<00:04:22.590> suppose

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
file copy or paste there were suppose

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.920 
file copy or paste there were suppose
to<00:04:23.160> be<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.850> folders<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.420> just<00:04:24.630> override

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
to be in the folders and just override

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.530 
to be in the folders and just override
it<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.320> says<00:04:25.530> that's<00:04:26.310> simpler<00:04:27.180> way

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
it that says that's simpler way

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.140 
it that says that's simpler way
now<00:04:28.050> we're<00:04:28.350> gonna<00:04:28.500> demonstrate<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.910> let's

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
now we're gonna demonstrate it so let's

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.500 
now we're gonna demonstrate it so let's
go<00:04:30.300> into<00:04:30.450> block<00:04:30.780> launcher<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.490> basically<00:04:32.510> the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
go into block launcher and basically the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.360 
go into block launcher and basically the
the<00:04:36.510> texture<00:04:36.780> pack<00:04:37.020> wherever<00:04:37.290> you<00:04:37.470> had<00:04:37.710> the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
the texture pack wherever you had the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.590 
the texture pack wherever you had the
thing<00:04:38.610> in<00:04:38.640> should<00:04:39.300> be<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:40.670> there<00:04:41.670> or<00:04:42.390> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
thing in should be in there or the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.700 
thing in should be in there or the
things<00:04:42.840> should<00:04:42.990> be<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.200> there<00:04:43.350> if<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.500> did<00:04:43.620> it

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
things should be in there if you did it

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.650 
things should be in there if you did it
all<00:04:43.830> right<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.520> will<00:04:44.640> see<00:04:44.850> this<00:04:45.030> happen<00:04:45.450> wait

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
block launcher to load up here now this

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.790 
block launcher to load up here now this
is<00:04:57.510> how<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.660> install<00:04:57.810> texture<00:04:58.470> packs<00:04:58.650> if

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
is how you install texture packs if

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
is how you install texture packs if
you're<00:04:58.920> not<00:04:59.040> if<00:04:59.160> you're<00:04:59.310> wondering<00:04:59.640> just

that<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.240> texture<00:06:09.630> so<00:06:09.720> as<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:09.930> can<00:06:10.050> tell

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
that a texture so as you can tell

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.710 
that a texture so as you can tell
everything<00:06:10.590> is<00:06:10.830> fine<00:06:11.160> because<00:06:11.670> 0.5<00:06:12.360> textures

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
everything is fine because 0.5 textures

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.470 
everything is fine because 0.5 textures
do<00:06:12.960> work<00:06:13.170> with<00:06:13.410> 0.10<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.850> only<00:06:15.030> difference<00:06:15.360> is

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
do work with 0.10 the only difference is

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.730 
do work with 0.10 the only difference is
the<00:06:15.570> water<00:06:15.750> but<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.020> water<00:06:16.170> isn't<00:06:16.350> missed<00:06:16.590> up
