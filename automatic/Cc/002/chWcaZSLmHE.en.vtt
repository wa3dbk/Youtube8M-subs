four<00:00:00.900> people<00:00:01.319> earned<00:00:01.770> one<00:00:01.949> hundred<00:00:02.100> and

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
four people earned one hundred and

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.010 
four people earned one hundred and
eighty<00:00:02.700> dollars<00:00:03.210> for<00:00:03.480> working<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:03.929> an

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
eighty dollars for working in an

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.710 
eighty dollars for working in an
after-school<00:00:04.470> program<00:00:04.740> if<00:00:05.490> they<00:00:05.940> divide<00:00:06.359> this

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
after-school program if they divide this

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.059 
after-school program if they divide this
money<00:00:07.020> up<00:00:07.109> equally

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
money up equally

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.759 
money up equally
how<00:00:08.639> much<00:00:09.000> will<00:00:09.210> each<00:00:09.510> person<00:00:10.019> receive<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.650> we

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
how much will each person receive so we

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.980 
how much will each person receive so we
want<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> divide<00:00:11.370> one<00:00:12.150> hundred<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.719> eighty

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
want to divide one hundred and eighty

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.650 
want to divide one hundred and eighty
dollars<00:00:13.500> into<00:00:13.920> four<00:00:14.280> equal<00:00:14.820> groups<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.509> that

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
dollars into four equal groups so that

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.240 
dollars into four equal groups so that
each<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.170> four<00:00:16.199> people<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
each of the four people can have the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.939 
each of the four people can have the
same<00:00:17.460> amount<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.570> want<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.900> divide<00:00:19.170> one

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
same amount so we want to divide one

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.519 
same amount so we want to divide one
hundred<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.430> eighty<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:21.600> want<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> divide<00:00:22.140> one

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
hundred and eighty we want to divide one

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.599 
hundred and eighty we want to divide one
hundred<00:00:22.890> eighty<00:00:23.070> by<00:00:23.850> four<00:00:24.480> by<00:00:25.410> four<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.430> want

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
hundred eighty by four by four we want

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.189 
hundred eighty by four by four we want
to<00:00:26.670> take<00:00:26.820> 180<00:00:27.390> divided<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.760> four<00:00:29.760> now<00:00:30.480> most<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
to take 180 divided by four now most of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.749 
to take 180 divided by four now most of
us<00:00:31.349> don't<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.920> off<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> top<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.520> our

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
us don't know this off the top of our

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
us don't know this off the top of our
heads<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> need<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> solve<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.559> need<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
heads so we need to solve for we need to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740 
heads so we need to solve for we need to
do<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.070> bit<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.370> division<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.450> another

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
do a little bit of division so another

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.090 
do a little bit of division so another
way<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.960> writing<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.500> exact<00:00:37.920> same

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
way of writing this exact same

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.740 
way of writing this exact same
expression<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.120> write<00:00:39.329> four<00:00:39.840> divided<00:00:40.829> into

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
expression is to write four divided into

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.680 
expression is to write four divided into
divide<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.930> into<00:00:44.059> 180<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.329> write<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> like

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
divide it into 180 and we write it like

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
divide it into 180 and we write it like
this<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.079> easier<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.980> either<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
this it's easier to do it if either of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.220 
this it's easier to do it if either of
them<00:00:47.910> actually<00:00:48.239> has<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.690> than<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.050> digits

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
them actually has more than one digits

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.840 
them actually has more than one digits
especially<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> number<00:00:50.309> we're<00:00:50.460> dividing

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
especially if the number we're dividing

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209 
especially if the number we're dividing
into<00:00:51.329> has<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.930> than<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:52.860> three

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
into has more than one or two or three

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.689 
into has more than one or two or three
or<00:00:53.399> four<00:00:53.480> digits<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
or four digits so let's do it so the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.130 
or four digits so let's do it so the
first<00:00:56.910> thing<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> say<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.390> well<00:00:57.660> does<00:00:57.840> 4<00:00:58.109> go

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
first thing you say is well does 4 go

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.799 
first thing you say is well does 4 go
into<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.820> 104<00:00:59.820> does<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.149> go<00:01:00.329> into<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.660> it's

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
into one 104 does not go into one it's

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
into one 104 does not go into one it's
larger<00:01:01.289> than<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> could<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> zero

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
larger than one so you could put a zero

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.820 
larger than one so you could put a zero
up<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:03.899> instead<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> doing<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.559> let's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
up here but instead of doing that let's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
up here but instead of doing that let's
just<00:01:04.979> say<00:01:05.070> let's<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.700> move<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> right

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
just say let's just move on to the right

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850 
just say let's just move on to the right
and<00:01:06.720> say<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:07.020> okay<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.229> doesn't<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.650> one

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and say well okay it doesn't go into one

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.410 
and say well okay it doesn't go into one
does<00:01:08.369> 4<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.700> into<00:01:08.880> 18<00:01:09.740> well<00:01:10.740> 4<00:01:11.010> times<00:01:11.040> 4<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.060> 16

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
does 4 go into 18 well 4 times 4 is 16

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.590 
does 4 go into 18 well 4 times 4 is 16
so<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> goes<00:01:13.320> into<00:01:13.560> 18<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.220> least<00:01:14.790> 4<00:01:15.030> times<00:01:15.210> 4

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
so that goes into 18 at least 4 times 4

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.370 
so that goes into 18 at least 4 times 4
times<00:01:15.780> 5<00:01:16.350> let<00:01:16.799> me<00:01:16.890> write<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.220> down<00:01:17.420> 4<00:01:18.420> times<00:01:18.869> 4

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
times 5 let me write this down 4 times 4

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.240 
times 5 let me write this down 4 times 4
is<00:01:19.409> equal<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.100> 16<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> goes<00:01:21.540> into<00:01:21.780> 18<00:01:22.259> 4

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
is equal to 16 so that goes into 18 4

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.020 
is equal to 16 so that goes into 18 4
times<00:01:23.820> 5<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.479> equal<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.200> 20<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.580> does<00:01:26.759> not

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
times 5 is equal to 20 so that does not

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
times 5 is equal to 20 so that does not
go<00:01:27.330> into<00:01:27.479> 18<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.770> into

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
go into 18 so this is going to go into

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
go into 18 so this is going to go into
18<00:01:29.369> 4<00:01:29.880> times<00:01:30.450> 4<00:01:31.320> times<00:01:31.350> 4<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.009> 16<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:34.200> we

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
18 4 times 4 times 4 is 16 and now we

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.899 
18 4 times 4 times 4 is 16 and now we
subtract<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.009> essentially<00:01:35.310> find<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
subtract we essentially find the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.340 
subtract we essentially find the
remainder<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.780> 18<00:01:37.229> minus<00:01:37.619> 6<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.310> 2<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:40.290> we

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
remainder here 18 minus 6 is 2 now we

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.280 
remainder here 18 minus 6 is 2 now we
want<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> bring<00:01:41.310> down<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.970> 0<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:43.170> we

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
want to bring down this 0 because we

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.069 
want to bring down this 0 because we
really<00:01:43.619> said<00:01:43.860> 4<00:01:44.220> goes<00:01:44.430> into<00:01:44.460> 180<00:01:45.060> 40<00:01:45.810> times

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
really said 4 goes into 180 40 times

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.499 
really said 4 goes into 180 40 times
because<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> tens<00:01:46.950> place<00:01:47.270> 40<00:01:48.270> times

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
because it's in the tens place 40 times

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
because it's in the tens place 40 times
4<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.899> 160<00:01:49.710> 180<00:01:50.520> minus<00:01:50.970> 160<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> 20<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:53.189> why

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
4 is 160 180 minus 160 is 20 that's why

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.830 
4 is 160 180 minus 160 is 20 that's why
we<00:01:53.490> bring<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> 0<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.780> think

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
we bring down to 0 but if you just think

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
we bring down to 0 but if you just think
about<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.259> process<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> say<00:01:56.100> okay<00:01:56.640> what's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
about the process you say okay what's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
about the process you say okay what's
the<00:01:57.030> large<00:01:57.360> what's<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> smallest<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.860> just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the large what's the smallest if I just

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.920 
the large what's the smallest if I just
go<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> 1/4<00:02:00.180> doesn't<00:02:00.479> go<00:02:00.570> into<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.869> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
go with the 1/4 doesn't go into it so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.480 
go with the 1/4 doesn't go into it so
let<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.110> move<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.680> let<00:02:01.890> me<00:02:01.979> look<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> 1

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
let me move on so let me look at the 1

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.469 
let me move on so let me look at the 1
and<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.729> 8<00:02:02.759> 18<00:02:03.479> 4<00:02:04.110> goes<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.560> 4<00:02:04.950> times<00:02:05.479> 4

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and the 8 18 4 goes into that 4 times 4

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.559 
and the 8 18 4 goes into that 4 times 4
times<00:02:06.630> 4<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.930> 16<00:02:07.310> subtract<00:02:08.310> from<00:02:08.459> 18<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
times 4 is 16 subtract from 18 you get a

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.040 
times 4 is 16 subtract from 18 you get a
2

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
2

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.010 
2
bring<00:02:10.500> down<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.860> 0<00:02:11.250> now<00:02:11.760> 4<00:02:12.090> goes<00:02:12.300> into<00:02:12.330> 20<00:02:12.780> how

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
bring down the 0 now 4 goes into 20 how

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.790 
bring down the 0 now 4 goes into 20 how
many<00:02:13.260> times

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
many times

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
many times
well<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.430> wrote<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> over<00:02:14.820> here<00:02:15.090> four

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
well we just wrote it over here four

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.110 
well we just wrote it over here four
times<00:02:15.660> five<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.050> equal<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.740> twenty<00:02:17.130> four<00:02:17.880> times

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
times five is equal to twenty four times

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.050 
times five is equal to twenty four times
five<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.390> equal<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> 20<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.230> 4<00:02:19.470> goes<00:02:19.680> into<00:02:19.710> 20<00:02:20.130> 5

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
five is equal to 20 so 4 goes into 20 5

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.220 
five is equal to 20 so 4 goes into 20 5
times<00:02:21.480> 5<00:02:21.990> times<00:02:22.050> 4<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.800> 20<00:02:23.360> use<00:02:24.360> subtract<00:02:24.960> and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
times 5 times 4 is 20 use subtract and

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.220 
times 5 times 4 is 20 use subtract and
you<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.500> no<00:02:25.890> remainder<00:02:26.280> left<00:02:26.460> over<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.600> 180

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
you have no remainder left over so 180

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.690 
you have no remainder left over so 180
divided<00:02:28.770> by<00:02:28.890> 4<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.610> equal<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.980> 45<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.490> if<00:02:32.550> these

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
divided by 4 is equal to 45 so if these

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.270 
divided by 4 is equal to 45 so if these
four<00:02:32.940> people<00:02:33.300> were<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.570> split<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.080> money

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
four people were to split the money

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.830 
four people were to split the money
equally<00:02:35.280> they'll<00:02:35.940> each<00:02:36.150> get<00:02:36.480> 45<00:02:37.170> dollars
