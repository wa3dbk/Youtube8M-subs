 cooler today we will tell you about 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.769
 chariots loading that's just 35 and I 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.960
 bottom-up cooler 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.320
 compressor cooling and now we 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.130
 tell you how to use it before 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:32.869
 just open the locker 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:32.869
 remove the lid from the bottle and insert 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.230
 is inserted 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:49.700
 way and you need to very tightly close 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:59.399
 a cover further a holiday we boot the cooler 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:04.400
 only after this including the block, after 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:09.200
 switching on immediately turns on the pump 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.200
 which ends the water in both bye 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.020
 pumbo work quietly enough 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.680
 the first time she will pump up the boat 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.009
 Park about ten minutes later to whom 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.320
 turns on automatically with each 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.659
 flew off the water will be filled when 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.600
 filled with the light goes out and the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.450
 now says this is an indicator of what 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 not enough water 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.110
 The advantages of this cooler are that 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.119
 there was no independently turned off heating and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.590
 cooling 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:46.890
 that you will save enough yours 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.100
 electricity is disconnected independently 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.700
 Highlighting the tap area is enough 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.890
 quiet computer and quite quiet compress 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.770
 its power will hardly be heard 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.670
 heating this cooler 420 you can 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.670
 cooling became 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.399
 it will heat up to a maximum of 95 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.989
 degrees at a rate of 5 liters per hour and 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.110
 cool to 4 degrees 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.450
 disabled average power consumption one 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.650
 kilowatt-hour energy class 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.680
 efficiency of the eye and so pump we 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.420
 pumped water into one indicator went out and 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.000
 next we check whether all barty 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.329
 filled with water here are three 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.299
 tap water supply to the cold about revenue 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.720
 temperatures and hot on hot tap 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.010
 that is, protection against accidental pressing that 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.760
 very important if you have small 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.180
 children so that they are not burned for long 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.690
 See good enough feed tap 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.420
 water 1 which is convenient enough for them 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.950
 nothing need to believe in the past dory we 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.359
 turn on the heating and cooling 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.200
 all compressor mask feeling too 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:05.500
 hear this that enough typhus also 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 there is an indicator that I said 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.920
 backlight also turns off that 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.920
 comfortable enough 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.560
 and the first time the water will heat up with 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.950
 15-20 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.330
 cool it for about an hour and then 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.700
 temperature will be automatically 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.740
 be supported 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.910
