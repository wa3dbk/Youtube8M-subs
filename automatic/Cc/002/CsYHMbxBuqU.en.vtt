00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that's two but it's too hard there's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
that's two but it's too hard there's
always<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.379> prohibitive<00:00:56.219> kinds<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
always going to be prohibitive kinds of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
outside of the school setting but I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.510 
outside of the school setting but I
think<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> take<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> look<00:01:02.070> at<00:01:02.219> what

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
think we have to take a look at what

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.700
