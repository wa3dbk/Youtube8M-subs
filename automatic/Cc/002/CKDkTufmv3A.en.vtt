00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220 

yeah<00:00:00.240> so<00:00:00.420> tomorrow<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:01.020> be<00:00:01.079> doing

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
yeah so tomorrow we're going to be doing

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.740 
yeah so tomorrow we're going to be doing
some<00:00:01.500> practice<00:00:01.680> with<00:00:02.190> phylogenetic<00:00:03.179> trees<00:00:03.449> or

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
some practice with phylogenetic trees or

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.570 
some practice with phylogenetic trees or
cladograms<00:00:04.350> now<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:04.980> going<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.160> talk<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> lot

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
cladograms now we're going to talk a lot

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.829 
cladograms now we're going to talk a lot
more<00:00:05.850> about<00:00:06.060> these<00:00:06.270> when<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.540> get<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.810> our

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
more about these when we get to our

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.020 
more about these when we get to our
classification<00:00:07.680> unit<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.639> right<00:00:08.760> now<00:00:08.880> it's

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
classification unit but right now it's

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.820 
classification unit but right now it's
really<00:00:09.240> important<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.840> understand<00:00:10.469> how<00:00:10.679> they

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
really important to understand how they

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709 
really important to understand how they
work<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.460> can<00:00:11.610> look<00:00:11.790> at<00:00:11.940> evolutionary

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
work so we can look at evolutionary

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.749 
work so we can look at evolutionary
relationships<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.889> right<00:00:14.040> let's<00:00:14.549> take<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
relationships all right let's take a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.849 
relationships all right let's take a
look<00:00:14.960> all<00:00:15.960> right<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.529> we're<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
look all right so so we're going to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.349 
look all right so so we're going to
start<00:00:17.039> talking<00:00:17.340> about<00:00:17.400> cladograms<00:00:18.090> or

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
start talking about cladograms or

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.210 
start talking about cladograms or
phylogenetic<00:00:19.230> trees<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.800> they're<00:00:19.920> also

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
phylogenetic trees as they're also

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.010 
phylogenetic trees as they're also
called<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
called and what it is is just a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.870 
called and what it is is just a
visualization<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:23.100> evolutionary

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
visualization of evolutionary

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.870 
visualization of evolutionary
relationships<00:00:24.720> or<00:00:24.990> relatedness<00:00:25.500> between

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
relationships or relatedness between

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.269 
relationships or relatedness between
species<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.769> complicated

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
species so this is kind of a complicated

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.980 
species so this is kind of a complicated
cladogram<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.090> let's<00:00:30.240> look<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> simple<00:00:30.869> one

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
cladogram so let's look at a simple one

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.620 
cladogram so let's look at a simple one
first<00:00:31.399> okay<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.640> call<00:00:32.790> cladograms<00:00:33.420> or

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
first okay so we call cladograms or

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.170 
first okay so we call cladograms or
phylogenetic<00:00:34.440> trees<00:00:34.680> tree<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
phylogenetic trees tree like because the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
phylogenetic trees tree like because the
kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> branches<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.800> end<00:00:37.980> points<00:00:38.340> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
kind of branches and the end points of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
kind of branches and the end points of
each<00:00:38.520> branch<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.629> represent<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
each branch is gonna represent a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
each branch is gonna represent a
specific<00:00:41.010> species<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.520> closer<00:00:44.520> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
specific species so the closer to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
specific species so the closer to
species<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.510> located<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.960> each<00:00:46.110> other<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
species are located to each other the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
species are located to each other the
more<00:00:47.010> recently<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.760> share<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> common

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
more recently they share a common

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
more recently they share a common
ancestor<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.079> example<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.250> flowering

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ancestor so example here flowering

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.810 
ancestor so example here flowering
plants<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.629> ferns<00:00:51.930> share<00:00:52.520> recent<00:00:53.520> common

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
plants and ferns share recent common

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.150 
plants and ferns share recent common
ancestor<00:00:54.390> whereas<00:00:54.719> ferns<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:57.620> love<00:00:58.620> mosses

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
ancestor whereas ferns and love mosses

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880 
ancestor whereas ferns and love mosses
share<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> more<00:01:00.180> distant<00:01:00.660> common<00:01:01.170> ancestor<00:01:01.710> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
share a more distant common ancestor in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.369 
share a more distant common ancestor in
a<00:01:02.309> properly<00:01:02.879> scaled<00:01:03.180> cladogram<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.140> branch

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
a properly scaled cladogram the branch

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
a properly scaled cladogram the branch
lengths<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:04.979> proportional<00:01:05.549> proportional<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
lengths are proportional proportional to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.929 
lengths are proportional proportional to
the<00:01:06.630> length<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.110> time<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.939> intersection

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the length of time and the intersection

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
the length of time and the intersection
between<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.450> branches<00:01:09.869> represents<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
between two branches represents the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710 
between two branches represents the
common<00:01:10.920> ancestor<00:01:11.450> sometimes<00:01:12.450> they're<00:01:12.689> not

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
common ancestor sometimes they're not

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
common ancestor sometimes they're not
proportional<00:01:13.470> sometimes<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.189> can't<00:01:14.400> even

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
proportional sometimes we can't even

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.990 
proportional sometimes we can't even
gaze<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:16.560> years<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.040> was<00:01:17.220> since<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> common

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
gaze of years it was since the common

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.499 
gaze of years it was since the common
ancestor<00:01:18.710> existed<00:01:19.710> however<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.150> still<00:01:21.330> gives

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
ancestor existed however it still gives

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
ancestor existed however it still gives
us<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> general<00:01:21.780> idea<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.470> where<00:01:23.310> species<00:01:23.729> are

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
us a general idea of where species are

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.630 
us a general idea of where species are
derived<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:24.659> okay<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:26.100> phylogenetic

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
derived from okay so some phylogenetic

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.830 
derived from okay so some phylogenetic
trees<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.210> cladograms

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
trees are cladograms

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.510 
trees are cladograms
are<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> include<00:01:28.560> additional<00:01:29.130> details

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
are going to include additional details

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
are going to include additional details
such<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.090> evolution<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.810> particular

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
such as the evolution of particular

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.280 
such as the evolution of particular
physical<00:01:31.860> structures<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:33.570> these<00:01:33.930> structures

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
physical structures so these structures

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.480 
physical structures so these structures
going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.560> called<00:01:34.770> shared<00:01:35.100> derived

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
going to be called shared derived

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
going to be called shared derived
characteristic<00:01:36.479> shared<00:01:36.810> derived

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
characteristic shared derived

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.370 
characteristic shared derived
characteristics<00:01:39.110> historically<00:01:40.110> these

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
characteristics historically these

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
characteristics historically these
physical<00:01:40.799> structures<00:01:41.159> were<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.579> were<00:01:41.759> used

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
physical structures were what were used

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.359 
physical structures were what were used
to<00:01:42.180> create<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> cladograms<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.040> have

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to create the cladograms but now we have

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.149 
to create the cladograms but now we have
modern-day<00:01:44.880> cladistics<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:46.049> rely<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.680> heavy

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
modern-day cladistics that rely on heavy

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.780 
modern-day cladistics that rely on heavy
genetic<00:01:47.970> evidence<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:50.100> we're<00:01:50.340> able<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.640> look

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
genetic evidence so we're able to look

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.969 
genetic evidence so we're able to look
at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> biochemical<00:01:51.960> structure<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.530> proteins

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
at the biochemical structure of proteins

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
at the biochemical structure of proteins
and<00:01:53.159> compare<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.000> structure<00:01:54.450> two<00:01:54.780> different

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
and compare that structure two different

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.770 
and compare that structure two different
species<00:01:55.560> proteins<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:57.149> who's<00:01:57.390> more

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
species proteins and see who's more

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.380 
species proteins and see who's more
closely<00:01:58.020> related<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> each<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:59.490> okay<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
closely related to each other okay so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
closely related to each other okay so
how<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.750> make<00:02:01.020> our<00:02:01.290> own<00:02:01.320> cladogram<00:02:02.189> or

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
how do we make our own cladogram or

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.630 
how do we make our own cladogram or
phylogenetic<00:02:03.030> tree<00:02:03.180> let's<00:02:03.689> start<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.229> a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
phylogenetic tree let's start with a

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
phylogenetic tree let's start with a
problem<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.540> let's<00:02:06.719> compare<00:02:06.990> some<00:02:07.200> organisms

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
problem so let's compare some organisms

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.210 
problem so let's compare some organisms
we<00:02:07.920> know

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
we know

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.040 
we know
now<00:02:08.460> that<00:02:08.640> chimpanzees<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.510> humans<00:02:09.570> share

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
now that chimpanzees and humans share

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.830 
now that chimpanzees and humans share
about<00:02:10.290> 96%<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.280> DNA<00:02:11.670> which<00:02:12.240> would<00:02:12.390> place<00:02:12.600> them

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
about 96% of DNA which would place them

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
about 96% of DNA which would place them
pretty<00:02:13.230> close<00:02:13.410> together<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> phylogenetic

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
pretty close together on a phylogenetic

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.000 
pretty close together on a phylogenetic
tree<00:02:15.030> humans<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.140> fruit<00:02:16.350> flies<00:02:16.500> share

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
tree humans and fruit flies share

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.280 
tree humans and fruit flies share
approximately<00:02:17.730> 60%<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.600> their<00:02:18.750> DNA<00:02:19.080> which

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
approximately 60% of their DNA which

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.770 
approximately 60% of their DNA which
would<00:02:19.470> place<00:02:19.680> them<00:02:19.950> further<00:02:20.310> apart<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.090> let's

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
would place them further apart so let's

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.210 
would place them further apart so let's
try<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.930> draw<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.200> cladogram<00:02:22.590> based<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.130> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
try to draw a cladogram based on that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.460 
try to draw a cladogram based on that
information<00:02:23.630> okay<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.170> start<00:02:25.380> with

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
information okay so we can start with

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.950 
information okay so we can start with
our<00:02:25.500> initial<00:02:25.680> branch<00:02:26.630> indicating<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> common

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
our initial branch indicating a common

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.040 
our initial branch indicating a common
ancestor<00:02:28.350> down<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.810> what<00:02:30.810> we're<00:02:30.930> going

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
ancestor down here and what we're going

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.990 
ancestor down here and what we're going
to<00:02:31.080> do<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.650> know<00:02:31.860> our<00:02:32.130> species<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.700> end<00:02:32.820> with

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
to do is we know our species we end with

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.890 
to do is we know our species we end with
which<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.450> humans<00:02:34.310> but<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.460> here<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.810> going

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
which is humans but up here it's going

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.570 
which is humans but up here it's going
to<00:02:36.960> be<00:02:37.050> at<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> top<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.590> that's<00:02:37.710> pretty<00:02:38.040> close

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
to be at the top and that's pretty close

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.630 
to be at the top and that's pretty close
to<00:02:39.020> chimpanzees<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.380> we'll<00:02:40.560> put<00:02:40.740> chips<00:02:41.130> here

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
to chimpanzees so we'll put chips here

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.990 
to chimpanzees so we'll put chips here
and<00:02:42.410> fruit<00:02:43.410> flies<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> little<00:02:44.790> bit

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
and fruit flies we know are a little bit

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.880 
and fruit flies we know are a little bit
more<00:02:45.300> distantly<00:02:45.660> related<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.350> we'll<00:02:46.470> put<00:02:46.680> them

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
more distantly related so we'll put them

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.690 
more distantly related so we'll put them
down<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.950> now<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.580> our

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
down here so now we have our

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.400 
down here so now we have our
phylogenetic<00:02:51.090> tree<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.840> know<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.140> chimps

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
phylogenetic tree we know that chimps

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.380 
phylogenetic tree we know that chimps
and<00:02:52.500> humans<00:02:52.560> share<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.040> common<00:02:53.310> ancestor<00:02:53.760> and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and humans share a common ancestor and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.420 
and humans share a common ancestor and
fruit<00:02:55.050> flies<00:02:55.170> chimps<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.890> humans<00:02:55.950> all

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
fruit flies chimps and humans all

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.490 
fruit flies chimps and humans all
probably<00:02:56.730> share<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.180> common<00:02:57.600> ancestor<00:02:58.080> down

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
probably share a common ancestor down

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.920 
probably share a common ancestor down
here<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.790> let's<00:02:59.970> look<00:03:00.060> at<00:03:00.210> this<00:03:00.300> phylogenetic

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
here so let's look at this phylogenetic

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.420 
here so let's look at this phylogenetic
tree<00:03:01.140> with<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.350> bunch<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.620> dinosaurs

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
tree with a bunch of dinosaurs

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.300 
tree with a bunch of dinosaurs
what<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.090> guess<00:03:03.540> or<00:03:03.840> derive<00:03:04.170> from<00:03:04.560> this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
what can we guess or derive from this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.430 
what can we guess or derive from this
cladogram<00:03:05.550> who<00:03:06.300> or<00:03:06.540> what<00:03:06.780> kind<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:07.020> dinosaurs

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
cladogram who or what kind of dinosaurs

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.310 
cladogram who or what kind of dinosaurs
are<00:03:07.590> related<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> each<00:03:08.130> other<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.140> looks

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
are related to each other so it looks

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.800 
are related to each other so it looks
like<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.950> our<00:03:11.520> dine<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.060> Aika<00:03:12.209> switch<00:03:12.630> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
like here our dine and Aika switch is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.410 
like here our dine and Aika switch is
actually<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.410> relative<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.420> velociraptor

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
actually a relative of the velociraptor

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.449 
actually a relative of the velociraptor
that<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.200> more<00:03:16.739> closely<00:03:17.010> related<00:03:17.130> to

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
that we know is more closely related to

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.810 
that we know is more closely related to
birds<00:03:17.760> than<00:03:18.209> tyrannosaurus<00:03:19.110> rex<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.820> birds

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
birds than tyrannosaurus rex and birds

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.850 
birds than tyrannosaurus rex and birds
and<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.540> tyrannosaurus<00:03:22.200> actually<00:03:22.590> share<00:03:22.830> a

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
and the tyrannosaurus actually share a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.890 
and the tyrannosaurus actually share a
closer<00:03:23.160> common<00:03:23.550> ancestor<00:03:24.090> than<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
closer common ancestor than the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.020 
closer common ancestor than the
Tyrannosaurus<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:26.040> Triceratops<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
Tyrannosaurus and the Triceratops and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.460 
Tyrannosaurus and the Triceratops and
their<00:03:27.209> closest<00:03:27.540> common<00:03:27.810> ancestors<00:03:28.230> all<00:03:28.380> the

their closest common ancestors all the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.110 
their closest common ancestors all the
way<00:03:28.560> down<00:03:28.739> here<00:03:29.040> tomorrow<00:03:29.610> we're<00:03:29.820> gonna<00:03:29.880> get<00:03:30.060> a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
way down here tomorrow we're gonna get a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.610 
way down here tomorrow we're gonna get a
lot<00:03:30.270> more<00:03:30.480> practice<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:31.050> drawing

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
lot more practice with drawing

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.640 
lot more practice with drawing
cladograms<00:03:32.160> interpreting<00:03:32.850> kilograms<00:03:33.360> or

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
cladograms interpreting kilograms or

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.770 
cladograms interpreting kilograms or
phylogenetic<00:03:34.650> trees<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:36.030> make<00:03:36.450> sure<00:03:36.480> you

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
phylogenetic trees so make sure you

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.210 
phylogenetic trees so make sure you
understand<00:03:37.200> everything<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.709> video<00:03:38.010> and

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
understand everything in this video and

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.700 
understand everything in this video and
I'll<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.580> tomorrow
