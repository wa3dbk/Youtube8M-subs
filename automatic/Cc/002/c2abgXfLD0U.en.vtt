just<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:32.970> bud<00:02:33.270> break<00:02:33.480> otherwise<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.380> would

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
just that bud break otherwise it would

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.440 
just that bud break otherwise it would
we<00:02:34.800> would<00:02:35.100> really<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.640> dire<00:02:35.850> straits<00:02:36.300> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
we would really be in dire straits and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.960 
we would really be in dire straits and
that<00:02:36.600> pretty<00:02:36.870> much<00:02:36.990> saved<00:02:37.410> our<00:02:37.620> vintage<00:02:37.970> we

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970

had<00:02:39.120> very<00:02:39.300> early<00:02:39.690> bud<00:02:39.870> break<00:02:40.050> because<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
had very early bud break because of the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800 
had very early bud break because of the
dry<00:02:40.860> weather<00:02:41.070> which<00:02:41.940> has<00:02:42.150> advanced

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
dry weather which has advanced

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.450 
dry weather which has advanced
everything<00:02:43.170> which<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.590> why<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:43.980> could<00:02:44.160> start

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
everything which is why we could start

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.570 
everything which is why we could start
harvesting<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.750> early<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.740> surprise<00:02:47.070> is

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
harvesting so early that the surprise is

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.420 
harvesting so early that the surprise is
that<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.690> third<00:02:49.020> third<00:02:49.500> year<00:02:49.800> out<00:02:50.100> of

that's some not ideal for planning that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.910 
that's some not ideal for planning that
the<00:03:07.890> pace<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.370> harvest<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:10.080> should<00:03:10.710> say<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
the pace of harvest and I should say a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.710 
the pace of harvest and I should say a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
together all at once and kind of madness

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.080 
together all at once and kind of madness
out<00:03:43.500> there<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.890> them<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.550> vineyard<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:45.060> a

it's<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.030> drought<00:04:19.299> probably<00:04:19.750> I'm<00:04:20.200> sure<00:04:20.320> thats

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
it's the drought probably I'm sure thats

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.290 
it's the drought probably I'm sure thats

thousand<00:05:40.210> four<00:05:40.419> was<00:05:40.660> an<00:05:40.780> early<00:05:41.140> harvest<00:05:41.320> yeah

but it wasn't as condensed you know it
started<00:05:47.500> early<00:05:47.800> but<00:05:48.070> yeah<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.970> know<00:05:49.120> there

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
started early but yeah you know there

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.450 
started early but yeah you know there
was<00:05:49.690> a<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.960> few<00:05:50.290> pauses<00:05:50.500> along<00:05:51.040> the<00:05:51.190> way<00:05:51.310> he

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
was a a few pauses along the way he

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.190 
was a a few pauses along the way he
dribbles<00:05:51.880> along<00:05:52.150> for<00:05:52.390> a<00:05:52.419> bed<00:05:52.600> yeah<00:05:53.340> 77<00:05:54.990> no<00:05:55.990> but

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
dribbles along for a bed yeah 77 no but

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.560 
dribbles along for a bed yeah 77 no but
it<00:05:56.290> was<00:05:56.410> I<00:05:56.530> was<00:05:56.710> but<00:05:57.130> a<00:05:57.160> short<00:05:57.610> it<00:05:57.820> was<00:05:57.850> short<00:05:58.180> of

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
it was I was but a short it was short of

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.290 
it was I was but a short it was short of
chakra<00:05:59.020> cooler<00:05:59.290> year<00:05:59.620> shorter<00:06:00.580> crop<00:06:00.880> so<00:06:01.180> it

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
chakra cooler year shorter crop so it

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.960 
chakra cooler year shorter crop so it
wasn't<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:02.020> that<00:06:02.260> wasn't<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:03.370> problem<00:06:03.520> I

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
wasn't and that wasn't the problem I

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.360 
wasn't and that wasn't the problem I
mean<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.270> really<00:06:04.479> was<00:06:05.200> spread<00:06:05.530> out<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.800> know<00:06:05.890> 90

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
mean it really was spread out I know 90

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.460 
mean it really was spread out I know 90
was<00:06:06.520> a<00:06:06.550> condensed<00:06:07.240> harvest<00:06:07.600> for<00:06:07.750> Sonoma<00:06:08.140> but

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
was a condensed harvest for Sonoma but

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.490 
was a condensed harvest for Sonoma but
yeah<00:06:09.070> more<00:06:09.790> typical<00:06:10.360> Montebello<00:06:10.630> was<00:06:10.990> a<00:06:11.140> month

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
yeah more typical Montebello was a month

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.219 
yeah more typical Montebello was a month
later<00:06:11.740> so<00:06:12.160> yeah<00:06:12.669> easier<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.510> deal<00:06:13.750> and<00:06:14.050> we'll

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
later so yeah easier to deal and we'll

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.140 
later so yeah easier to deal and we'll
talk<00:06:14.470> about<00:06:14.650> it<00:06:14.830> maybe<00:06:14.979> as<00:06:15.100> we<00:06:15.310> get<00:06:15.490> to<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:15.729> 11

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
talk about it maybe as we get to the 11

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.900 
talk about it maybe as we get to the 11
