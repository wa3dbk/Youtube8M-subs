00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.219
 ksk vodka as tough 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.979
 again and copper nickle loop 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.979
 it is here 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.019
 shows the principle of work 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 due to the fact that the leash is 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.310
 Well, as always with the yield or how 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.449
 several ska site i.e. crossroads 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.650
 maybe so repeat christos again 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.170
 meters must be respected 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.390
 that the tent box a should be 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.970
 lower feeders but in this case than 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.220
 percent more twist the better 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.510
 Be sure that you definitely never 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
 so much not confused faces 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.930
 again in the mayor's office seeking inform 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 do not throw it splashes down 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.580
 asteroid 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.280
 Imagine 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.560
 currents if a very strong jet 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.980
 very strong jet for example it is with us 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.790
 is coming 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 left 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 you have planned 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.000
 East 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 he will not be clearly 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.160
 near the feeder 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.370
 we will have accordingly 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 can now start minstroy 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.369
 that is, it will be like this 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.040
 loss of cef 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.470
 and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 us blackout 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.390
 keneshe currents 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.710
 but then they find there is a boat 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 rebellion we are constantly on business 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.170
 turns out that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.760
 because it is here yes leash 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.620
 with nozzle 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.520
 Well, let him restrain 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.100
 and once again I will say that the feed on the reservoir 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.470
 with and what is the nekralova formed 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.560
 which people 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.630
 setting pull up 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.190
 which and 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.190
 fish feed on current 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550
 against the course of most cases 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.820
 same roach is active and right there lynch 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.770
 so here for example Yushchenko 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.219
 Fedor usually put under 45 degrees on 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.510
 horizon 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.880
 horizon rubles 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.229
 while the fight is biting 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.229
 it's very good to register immediately 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.309
 father to flow like going through 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.349
 of what then 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.529
 in my opinion just getting better 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:21.670
 percent other 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.059
 from the feed line 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:25.519
 and the feeder was just discharged 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.589
 intersects 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.670
 that is, she now look like 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.670
 fish popova popova talk 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.749
 unrest she project is prepared usually 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.889
 such a moment as reported from the point 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.049
 and resolve the issue will be even more 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.149
 strengthened 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.949
 that is, there is such valuable advice if you 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.569
 see what your leader 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.749
 first progressively 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.649
 amended pecked payer sharply 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:52.619
 straightened up means the feeder is simple 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.670
 shifted and in principle 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.060
 there is a big option which 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.270
 refused so in this case it is necessary 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.330
 act 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.569
 rod so 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.589
 as if to detect unnecessary demand then 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.469
 calm package so much check 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:05.249
 can be made 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.879
 already sits very often happens so people 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.159
 you saw that the dead played 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.970
 uncertainty 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.400
 do a lot more parking 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.990
 gone after they think so 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.749
 way 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.749
 percentage rubbing off the press 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:21.729
 secondly to 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.989
 usually placed in Grodno jet in 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.389
 during heavy feeding fish 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.839
 by the border 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.439
 here is moscow river 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.539
 on which on the lower Volga 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.789
 interest of enterprises 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.679
 In particular, 3 4 for I have one of the most 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:41.259
 popular 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:42.489
 means 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.919
 I want to say one more thing 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.220
 what can you make 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.410
 make here an atlas of us this motor 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.009
 local conditions 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.519
 and 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.239
 tie in the water area 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.289
 it would be best to use a volume there 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.879
 that sidebar one three there he's sick 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.879
 thirty five 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.259
 percent of millimeter to diameter 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.519
 Yes 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.489
 besides he 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.049
 we must in selling us in the hands of 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.549
 Lithuanian less visible 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.599
 like that 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.089
 and then when he comes fishing 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.629
 fine, some question 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.249
 how to your main line 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.629
 news 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:20.839
 but it is usually only in conditions 

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.219
 amateur fishing conditions sports 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.089
 fishing me in order not to inflict on 

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:26.840
 shipments were fewer units 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.970
 every time I called her nationalist 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.309
 lovers it will be very useful 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.529
 again if we 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:36.979
 increased 5 th 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.289
 yes, that is, they did it for example 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.430
 short 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.830
 and we literally floors 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.070
 centimeters of income would make her Tomsk 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.809
 30 meters 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:49.199
 that percentage 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.449
 the likelihood that danger itself grows in 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.580
 times present is required more 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.080
 time to 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.610
 but swimming nozzles on spent there two more 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.850
 big swallows 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.380
 of six teams but 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.240
 then you can just 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.370
 the first time not even see poklyuka 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.060
 so instead of like the middle ground then 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.919
 there are small river loops 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.949
 Anyuta athletes most popular 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.060
 then pit blues such with such a snap 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.550
 almost always on rivers and besides that year 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.949
 on the ponds gray days 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.779
 interest using trough as I already 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:25.849
 spoke 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.399
 quickly in this case under the conditions of Gogol with 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:30.830
 this installation feeder more 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.580
 never bother because there is 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.569
 passes through it 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.189
 that is, on the field 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.049
 if I were once more in parallel 

00:05:39.049 --> 00:05:41.169
 tied buy from to people have seen that from 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.349
 if suddenly 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.270
 gone 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.339
 on the agenda but there 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:47.830
 hit a little 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.460
 not just really starting just 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.900
 it's easy to dance here 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.050
 Beskov walk on the trough her 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.009
 displacement occurs from the shoulders 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.759
 especially big bless 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.279
 kilograms of stone spent 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.729
 questioning fleeing countries 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.729
 here is this little vibration house 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.559
 again and smoke bamboo have a direct 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:08.839
 connect 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.849
 one and a half hours 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.059
 For almost a month, keep in mind 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:14.349
 treatment 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:15.909
 this society can be imagined
