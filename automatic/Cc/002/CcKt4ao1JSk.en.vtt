00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
a monster defensive line after that no

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.420 
a monster defensive line after that no
look<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> fed<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.860> no<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.309> did

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

defense<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.739> estimated<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.550> he

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
defense so I estimated not because he

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
defense so I estimated not because he
was<00:01:02.940> gay<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> players<00:01:04.589> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
was gay but because of the players that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.080 
was gay but because of the players that
are<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> team<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.489> he<00:01:05.610> may<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.880> make<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
are on the team that he may not make it
