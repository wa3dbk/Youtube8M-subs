down<00:05:13.330> left<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.080> right<00:05:14.169> and<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:15.430> just<00:05:15.640> gives

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
down left and right and that just gives

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.430 
down left and right and that just gives
a<00:05:15.910> lot<00:05:16.090> more<00:05:16.360> comfort<00:05:18.330> this<00:05:19.330> right<00:05:19.540> here<00:05:19.750> is
