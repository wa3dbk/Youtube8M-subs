 good morning from the most evolutionary kitchen today 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 we will prepare a dessert and yaro fruit 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.839
 of walkways with raspberries and papaya 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.820
 wall units that we will need are a 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:38.810
 paper base chopper for 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.310
 walkways and an immersion blender 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:49.530
 believers are 100 g of sultanas 100 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:54.360
 g of dried mango for the cream one 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:59.130
 cup of dates a cup of raspberries and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.080
 half papaya and finally we will need a 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.510
 glass with at least two fingers of water 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.519
 first thing we put in the chopper 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.270
 he is the sultana that is absolutely not 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.189
 essential to soak and the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.189
 dried mango 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.829
 now all we have to do is take it 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.870
 a bit of our base as you see 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.180
 very pc so 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:31.930
 and put it inside ours 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:35.380
 maps we fill the base well 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.470
 it must be about a centimeter high 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.460
 we follow the same way with the others 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:48.520
 folders we fill we make a minimum 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 pressure compact our base e 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.030
 away talking 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.310
 now that we have finished cleaning up the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.160
 maps we can put in the fridge 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.800
 and wait for it to harden in 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.690
 meanwhile we can dedicate ourselves to 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.390
 preparation and then the cream 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.140
 now let 's put the papaya pulp i 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.630
 raspberries 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:17.020
 not all are nine pastries so ne 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:19.890
 we will keep out 9 and then decorate each 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.900
 single pastarella and dates in the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.330
 immersion blender container 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.620
 and whisk until you get a cream 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.500
 homogeneous 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.940
 we are ready to put everything together with 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.940
 water mobility 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.720

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.849

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.489
 homogeneous 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:53.630

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.790

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:06.560
 of the catwalks that meanwhile it is 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:10.010
