00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.109
 dvd criticism and this place awaits us 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.030
 yes the continuation of the percy jackson 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.250
 series or the first part 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.360
 in German cinemas but then should 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.650
 we again about the first 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:27.119
 have spoken and then it works now 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 around percy jackson thieves in the olymp 17 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 minutes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 that's nonsense how do you do that 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.710
 no idea I 'm just in the mood 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.180
 water 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.180
 that is, you can think in peace 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.450
 there are twelve olympic gods 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.310
 the big three are the gods zeus 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.760
 poseidon and have the kids this 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.440
 gods were just man god legamen 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.100
 Everything was supposed to be in this school 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.960
 run better 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.300
 At some point , everything makes sense 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.300
 percy jackson we need our data 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.730
 until there 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.370
 they found him who did not 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.370
 found 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.840
 we did not expect what is here 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.359
 Go on the gods there is half human 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.760
 God is father poseidon you are 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.880
 also very healthy 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.320
 in february why i am here as 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.800
 Ruler Lightning is the most powerful weapon 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.810
 ever created 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.810
 Everyone thinks you have the deal I have 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.250
 not stolen blur the borders 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.080
 not until the summer solstice 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.960
 there is war 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.530
 and the strongest have all the demigods 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.530
 special skills 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.630
 we have to face the fight we find 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.270
 the way 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.270
 whether heaven or rather the first moderate 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.050
 the defense about you that is a 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.880
 useful waffles that is a pin of 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.600
 users only in moments greatest danger 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.600
 This is a pen 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.040
 the time has expired and you are not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.040
 son of poseidon 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.319
 Percy Jackson thieves in the Olympics risk 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.879
 a glance 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.879
 from 11 february in the cinema 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.100
 Percy Jackson thieves in the Olympics 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.020
 original title percy jackson and olympia 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.690
 lightning thief it's more 2010 going on 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.760
 He was released for 120 years for 12 years 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.920
 and tells the story of just 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.390
 Percy Jackson in a boy who is in 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.520
 life would not be that easy 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.130
 like his mother against are currently 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.300
 years leading sign stepfather 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.020
 Defend that works but even 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.430
 not that easy 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.020
 and he has the feeling that also in the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.580
 not easy to have school 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.920
 but somehow one is always talking 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.780
 agree with him and he will find out 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.610
 that he created for something higher 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.110
 soon know each other in a new world 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.239
 new friends and especially in one 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.950
 world in the old friends very different 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.560
 beings are rediscovering because he is 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.110
 nothing less than a demi-god and 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.820
 the son poseidons with the order that 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.200
 yes actually a thief but 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.050
 find out who the real one 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.370
 thief of the flash of zeus is yes and 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.290
 that's the whole thing somehow 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.030
 fantasy film of all if I'm honest 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.100
 Harry Potter There is a secret place 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.480
 a half god camp there are friends 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.340
 around there is an order one 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.200
 fantastic mythic world the whole 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.670
 partly pretty neatly animated 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.720
 if you have to say that in the whole 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.540
 saga of greek mythology 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.040
 packed and in the end totally the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.420
 i find rhine case if i completely 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.860
 honest and wonder why 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.480
 you have to do a second part here 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.269
 and the cinema brings the film is 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.950
 unbelievably predictable the figures 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.360
 I'm too single-layered and there 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.040
 I honestly had to say it 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.350
 acts as a harry potter copy of the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.640
 Lean style and I'm pretty much 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.680
 left cold we have logan here 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.390
 lermann randy jackson as main actors 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.640
 they really do that well ps 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.810
 Browser play young companies to 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.269
 the familiar face one or the other 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.280
 all season compliant for one 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.200
 blockbuster movies fantasy area but 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.850
 just that one here also on fsk 12 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.350
 sits and still fight with it 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.880
 sword approaches at the no drips 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.340
 Blood flows finally 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.930
 on the top even less credible and that 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.780
 really exhausting is that these two 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.250
 hours the aetna half look like 301 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.530
 because you always have the feeling to know 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.120
 what happens next and that is 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.380
 Surprise poverty just in the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.000
 fantasy genre where everything is so beautiful 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.770
 The people are also fantastic 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.990
 to conjure little points on the eyes 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.820
 should then not enough of the film 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.650
 not especially at the box office 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.750
 went great and it is mine 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.030
 almost the question why do you do here 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.190
 a continuation 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.780
 with percy jackson this month in 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.430
 big question marks for german cinemas 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.050
 but I'm curious then wait 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.690
 but not so much that means that 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.070
 Percy Jackson thieves in the Olympics have to go all the way 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.290
 clearly say this series also has one 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.640
 big readers fishing community and me 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.560
 just do not think successful 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.450
 book adaptation is simply calculating that 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.040
 calculus the one filmed to want a series 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.260
 You can already tell by this first part 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.880
 you really want to invest now 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.280
 to start a new series 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.090
 instead of a good one 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.440
 to make independent film that is 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.630
 really a pity and means of me that 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.390
 Percy Jackson thieves in the Olympics as a year 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.840
 fantasy film for two or more 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.370
 teenagers in the first place 4 out of 10 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.290
 possible score gets total 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.000
 only four out of ten possible points 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.860
 they were so much more in it 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.490
 especially with a relatively large budget 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.080
 for this 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.670
 Well, I do not know what that should be 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.110
 hinder already very disappointed 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.640
 this place is similar 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.140
 despite likes in the comments or looks 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.030
 that's very different than me writing that 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.410
 also pure and why it was otherwise 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.050
 now from me with my little review 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.370
 to percy jackson thieves in the olympic last 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.020
 let a perm stay it 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.520
 if that creates like last my cinema 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.050
 revis over or at twitter and 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.550
 facebook as well as write about movies 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.050
 but do not want this or mine 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.520
 second channel if you have no videos 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.220
 Let's miss it if 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.140
 but only you decide tomorrow 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.450
 at 15 o'clock there is a late here and a 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.980
 new video and until then I hope you 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.450
 be back tomorrow, of course 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.450
 at 3
