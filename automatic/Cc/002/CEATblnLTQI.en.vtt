this is a seven-yard Roque a distance
that's<00:03:14.670> very<00:03:15.120> important<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.440> able<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.710> hit

that's very important to be able to hit
reliably<00:03:19.280> there<00:03:20.280> -<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.790> looks<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.360> similar

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
thing happened I hit a little bit on the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.580 
thing happened I hit a little bit on the
right<00:03:26.010> striking<00:03:26.760> face<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.540> my<00:03:27.930> mallet<00:03:28.320> as<00:03:28.440> we

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
right striking face of my mallet as we

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.060 
right striking face of my mallet as we
face<00:03:28.890> my<00:03:29.160> mallet<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:33.450> feet<00:03:33.810> looked<00:03:34.200> pretty

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
face my mallet the feet looked pretty

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.040 
face my mallet the feet looked pretty
well<00:03:35.250> aimed<00:03:35.550> on<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.030> last<00:03:36.270> one<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.900> was

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
well aimed on that last one so it was

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.620 
well aimed on that last one so it was
the<00:03:37.290> swing<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:37.980> was<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.280> loft<00:03:38.550> line<00:03:38.820> there

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
the swing that was on loft line there

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.620 
the swing that was on loft line there
was<00:03:39.750> an<00:03:39.900> example<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.650> casting<00:03:41.490> didn't<00:03:42.330> go<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
was an example of casting didn't go to a

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.710 
was an example of casting didn't go to a
still<00:03:42.959> position<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:44.040> feet<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.850> were<00:03:45.240> aimed

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
still position the feet and were aimed

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.630 
still position the feet and were aimed
straight<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> mallet<00:03:46.950> swung<00:03:47.280> along<00:03:47.610> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
straight and the mallet swung along a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.699 
straight and the mallet swung along a
lot<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> feet<00:03:48.360> leading<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.770> hit<00:03:51.709> here

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
lot of the feet leading to that hit here

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.010 
lot of the feet leading to that hit here
it<00:03:52.860> looks<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.220> my<00:03:53.550> feet<00:03:54.000> are<00:03:54.030> aimed<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.600> little

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
it looks like my feet are aimed a little

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.410 
it looks like my feet are aimed a little
bit<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.500> our<00:03:55.530> left<00:03:56.250> as<00:03:56.550> we<00:03:56.700> face<00:03:57.000> me<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:59.420> I'm

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
bit to our left as we face me and I'm

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.480 
bit to our left as we face me and I'm
swinging<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:01.020> little<00:04:01.140> bit<00:04:01.380> off<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.800> our<00:04:01.980> left

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
swinging a little bit off to our left

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.560 
swinging a little bit off to our left
and<00:04:04.520> what<00:04:05.520> happened<00:04:05.910> there<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.270> think<00:04:06.330> I

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
and what happened there is I think I

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.990 
and what happened there is I think I
miss<00:04:06.810> hit<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> little<00:04:07.290> bit<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:08.040> right-hand

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
miss hit a little bit on the right-hand

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.490 
miss hit a little bit on the right-hand
part<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.420> striking<00:04:09.690> face<00:04:10.020> so<00:04:10.200> there<00:04:10.320> was<00:04:10.470> a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
part of the striking face so there was a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.990 
part of the striking face so there was a
case<00:04:10.739> where<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> feet<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> don't<00:04:11.640> think<00:04:11.850> we're

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
case where the feet I don't think we're

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.199 
case where the feet I don't think we're
quite<00:04:12.150> right<00:04:12.510> nor<00:04:12.870> did<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.380> swing<00:04:14.250> go<00:04:14.880> along

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
quite right nor did the swing go along

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.210 
quite right nor did the swing go along
with<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.570> line<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.049> feet

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.499 

here<00:04:22.220> looks<00:04:22.520> like<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.819> feet<00:04:23.060> are<00:04:23.210> good<00:04:24.100> but

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
here looks like the feet are good but

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.189 
here looks like the feet are good but
the<00:04:26.509> mallet<00:04:26.960> swung<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> little<00:04:27.889> bit<00:04:28.130> along

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
the mallet swung a little bit along

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.170 
the mallet swung a little bit along
toward<00:04:30.199> our<00:04:30.440> left<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.240> 14<00:04:33.080> yard<00:04:33.349> shot

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
toward our left this is a 14 yard shot

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.210 
toward our left this is a 14 yard shot
shooting<00:04:35.180> at<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.599> blue<00:04:36.050> stripe<00:04:36.380> ball<00:04:36.680> I<00:04:36.710> put

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
shooting at the blue stripe ball I put

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.189 
shooting at the blue stripe ball I put
two<00:04:37.460> balls<00:04:37.699> together<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.360> make<00:04:38.539> it<00:04:38.660> easier<00:04:39.020> in

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
two balls together to make it easier in

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.710 
two balls together to make it easier in
case<00:04:39.229> I<00:04:39.590> hit<00:04:39.800> one<00:04:40.039> I<00:04:40.069> wouldn't<00:04:40.580> have<00:04:40.819> to<00:04:41.030> go

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
case I hit one I wouldn't have to go

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.969 
case I hit one I wouldn't have to go
retrieve<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.470> replace<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:43.810> blue<00:04:44.810> is<00:04:45.050> 14

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
retrieve it and replace it so blue is 14

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.939 
retrieve it and replace it so blue is 14
yards<00:04:46.340> from<00:04:46.610> yellow<00:04:50.020> now<00:04:51.020> there<00:04:51.289> it<00:04:51.650> looked

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
yards from yellow now there it looked

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.430 
yards from yellow now there it looked
like<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:53.180> ball<00:04:53.360> was<00:04:53.599> going<00:04:53.780> straight<00:04:53.990> for<00:04:54.410> a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
like the ball was going straight for a

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.680 
like the ball was going straight for a
while<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.039> ground<00:04:55.400> took<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.210> ball<00:04:56.479> to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
while and the ground took that ball to

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.230 
while and the ground took that ball to
our<00:04:56.720> right<00:04:57.380> now<00:04:57.889> that<00:04:58.220> happens<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:58.940> ground

can deprive us of a hit the swing seem

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.559 
can deprive us of a hit the swing seem
quite<00:05:05.539> straight

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
quite straight

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.570 
quite straight
happens

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.460 

there<00:05:11.879> looks<00:05:12.150> like<00:05:12.240> an<00:05:12.479> aimed<00:05:12.750> a<00:05:12.900> little<00:05:12.930> bit

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
there looks like an aimed a little bit

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.250 
there looks like an aimed a little bit
to<00:05:13.680> our<00:05:13.919> left<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.759> we<00:05:14.939> face<00:05:15.240> me

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.190 

and<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.920> was<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:22.030> ball<00:05:22.240> actually<00:05:22.480> went<00:05:22.960> pretty

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
and I was the ball actually went pretty

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.140 
and I was the ball actually went pretty
well<00:05:23.350> as<00:05:23.680> my<00:05:23.860> feet<00:05:24.100> were<00:05:24.250> lined<00:05:24.490> up<00:05:24.670> and<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:24.970> was

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
well as my feet were lined up and I was

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.810 
well as my feet were lined up and I was
aimed<00:05:25.840> a<00:05:26.110> little<00:05:26.380> bit<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.770> our<00:05:26.800> left<00:05:27.160> of<00:05:27.640> that

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
aimed a little bit to our left of that

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.480 
aimed a little bit to our left of that
target<00:05:28.630> ball<00:05:31.620> down<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:32.740> looks<00:05:32.890> like<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.220> may<00:05:33.460> be

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
target ball down it looks like I may be

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.890 
target ball down it looks like I may be
into<00:05:33.940> our<00:05:34.390> left<00:05:35.850> facing<00:05:36.850> may<00:05:37.300> see<00:05:37.780> how<00:05:37.840> the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
into our left facing may see how the

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.050 
into our left facing may see how the
mallets<00:05:38.470> not<00:05:38.770> really<00:05:39.160> covering<00:05:39.520> up<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.820> ball

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
mallets not really covering up the ball

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.080 
mallets not really covering up the ball
so<00:05:40.540> this<00:05:41.440> could<00:05:41.770> very<00:05:42.010> well<00:05:42.070> lead<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.730> Miss

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
so this could very well lead to a Miss

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.280 
so this could very well lead to a Miss
here<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:47.400> boy<00:05:48.400> not<00:05:48.700> only<00:05:49.000> aimed<00:05:49.630> wrong<00:05:50.050> but

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
here and boy not only aimed wrong but

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.430 
here and boy not only aimed wrong but
miss<00:05:50.530> hat<00:05:50.740> that<00:05:51.070> was<00:05:51.280> miss<00:05:51.640> it<00:05:52.440> significantly

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
miss hat that was miss it significantly

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.140 
miss hat that was miss it significantly
on<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:54.010> left-hand<00:05:54.490> part<00:05:54.640> of<00:05:54.730> the<00:05:54.790> striking

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
on the left-hand part of the striking

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:02.790 
on the left-hand part of the striking
face<00:05:55.510> as<00:05:56.230> we<00:05:56.920> face<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:58.180> mountain<00:05:58.600> face<00:06:01.800> again

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
face as we face the mountain face again

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.430 
face as we face the mountain face again
I<00:06:02.830> seem<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.340> be<00:06:03.490> aiming<00:06:03.940> a<00:06:03.970> little<00:06:04.240> bit<00:06:04.600> to<00:06:05.020> our

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
I seem to be aiming a little bit to our

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.720 
I seem to be aiming a little bit to our
left<00:06:05.980> my<00:06:06.820> right<00:06:07.060> as<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:07.390> face<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.870> target<00:06:08.730> looks

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
left my right as I face the target looks

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:16.800 
left my right as I face the target looks
where<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.090> feet<00:06:10.420> are<00:06:10.570> aimed

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.130 

and<00:06:17.190> again<00:06:18.190> whether<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.300> ground<00:06:19.600> caused<00:06:19.960> a

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
and again whether the ground caused a

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.510 
and again whether the ground caused a
little<00:06:20.260> bit<00:06:20.410> of<00:06:20.590> that<00:06:20.710> but<00:06:20.890> I<00:06:21.040> don't<00:06:21.220> think<00:06:21.430> I

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
little bit of that but I don't think I

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.160 
little bit of that but I don't think I
was<00:06:21.670> aimed<00:06:22.030> properly<00:06:22.300> at<00:06:22.870> that<00:06:23.170> ball

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
was aimed properly at that ball

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.050 
was aimed properly at that ball
obviously<00:06:26.170> this<00:06:26.350> is<00:06:26.590> a<00:06:26.820> bit<00:06:27.820> more<00:06:28.000> challenging

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
obviously this is a bit more challenging

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.840 
obviously this is a bit more challenging
than<00:06:28.690> the<00:06:28.960> 7-yard<00:06:29.470> shot<00:06:31.950> here<00:06:32.950> the<00:06:33.190> feet<00:06:33.550> look

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
than the 7-yard shot here the feet look

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.930 
than the 7-yard shot here the feet look
a<00:06:34.000> little<00:06:34.330> bit<00:06:34.480> better<00:06:34.720> aimed<00:06:38.670> and<00:06:39.670> that<00:06:39.790> was

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
a little bit better aimed and that was

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.760 
a little bit better aimed and that was
about<00:06:40.060> our<00:06:40.330> shot<00:06:40.570> you<00:06:40.870> could<00:06:41.020> see<00:06:41.200> the<00:06:41.350> mallet

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
about our shot you could see the mallet

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.360 
about our shot you could see the mallet
really<00:06:42.340> strayed<00:06:42.760> quite<00:06:43.420> straight<00:06:43.810> there<00:06:44.370> this

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
really strayed quite straight there this

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.730 
really strayed quite straight there this
is<00:06:45.610> a<00:06:45.640> profile<00:06:46.360> shot<00:06:46.390> of<00:06:46.870> a<00:06:46.960> couple<00:06:47.350> wicked

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
is a profile shot of a couple wicked

shots<00:06:48.750> what<00:06:49.750> we're<00:06:49.930> trying<00:06:50.169> to<00:06:50.260> look<00:06:50.380> for<00:06:50.650> here

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
shots what we're trying to look for here

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.710 
shots what we're trying to look for here
is<00:06:51.010> upper<00:06:51.370> body<00:06:51.580> movement<00:06:52.180> try<00:06:52.419> to<00:06:52.480> make<00:06:52.690> sure

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
is upper body movement try to make sure

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.780 
is upper body movement try to make sure
the<00:06:53.080> trunk<00:06:53.410> of<00:06:53.560> the<00:06:53.650> body<00:06:53.860> is<00:06:54.100> staying<00:06:54.340> still

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
the trunk of the body is staying still

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.659 
the trunk of the body is staying still
and<00:06:55.120> that<00:06:55.810> the<00:06:55.960> tempo<00:06:56.380> of<00:06:56.590> the<00:06:56.620> swing<00:06:57.040> is<00:06:57.220> even

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
and that the tempo of the swing is even

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.320 
and that the tempo of the swing is even
trying<00:06:58.240> to<00:06:58.360> have<00:06:58.480> the<00:06:58.780> same<00:06:59.620> speed<00:06:59.980> back<00:07:00.370> swing

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
trying to have the same speed back swing

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.260 
trying to have the same speed back swing
and<00:07:01.630> follow-through<00:07:02.669> not<00:07:03.669> hurrying<00:07:04.150> the

and follow-through not hurrying the

and follow-through not hurrying the
follow-through<00:07:04.690> if<00:07:05.020> possible<00:07:05.610> this<00:07:06.610> is<00:07:06.820> from

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
follow-through if possible this is from

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.000 
follow-through if possible this is from
a<00:07:07.150> yard<00:07:07.510> away<00:07:07.870> from<00:07:08.770> a<00:07:08.890> wicket<00:07:10.530> and<00:07:11.530> that<00:07:11.770> was

a yard away from a wicket and that was

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.100 
a yard away from a wicket and that was
done<00:07:12.280> in<00:07:12.340> a<00:07:12.550> still<00:07:12.850> position<00:07:13.360> the<00:07:13.510> first<00:07:13.690> in<00:07:14.020> a

pretty good idea of what a video

pretty good idea of what a video
analysis<00:07:18.610> of<00:07:18.790> shot-making<00:07:19.419> session<00:07:20.110> could<00:07:20.860> be

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
analysis of shot-making session could be
