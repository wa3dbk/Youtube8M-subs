00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.710 

we'll<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:22.280> I'm<00:01:23.280> thinking<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.270> later

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
we'll see I'm thinking on this one later

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.340 
we'll see I'm thinking on this one later
you<00:01:24.960> guys<00:01:25.080> didn't<00:01:25.320> wait<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.740> home<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you guys didn't wait the home the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
you guys didn't wait the home the
last<00:01:28.560> attempt<00:01:28.980> was<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.850> better

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
last attempt was a little bit better

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.530 
last attempt was a little bit better
yeah<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.280> secret<00:01:32.580> is<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:33.240> put<00:01:33.390> too

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
yeah I think the secret is don't put too

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.920 
yeah I think the secret is don't put too
much<00:01:33.570> oil<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.550> low<00:01:35.550> setting<00:01:35.940> didn't<00:01:36.810> take<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
much oil and low setting didn't take a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.210 
much oil and low setting didn't take a
little<00:01:37.050> bit<00:01:37.170> longer<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.040> because

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
little bit longer but it's just because

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.490 
little bit longer but it's just because
of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.900> consistency<00:01:39.900> other<00:01:40.020> crumbs<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
of the the consistency other crumbs you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
of the the consistency other crumbs you
gotta<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> work<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.460> more<00:01:41.520> but

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
gotta have to work a little bit more but

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.750 
gotta have to work a little bit more but
I<00:01:42.240> wanna<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.780> were<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> freeze<00:01:43.260> it<00:01:43.760> dip

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
I wanna see if you were to freeze it dip

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.070 
I wanna see if you were to freeze it dip
them<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.090> everything<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.570> freezing<00:01:45.930> like

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
them and everything in freezing like

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.230 
them and everything in freezing like
regular<00:01:46.380> mozzarella<00:01:46.530> sticks<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.400> probably

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
regular mozzarella sticks and probably

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.570 
regular mozzarella sticks and probably
just<00:01:48.510> bake<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:48.870> for<00:01:49.830> every<00:01:50.040> fry<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.400> think

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
just bake them for every fry it I think

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.340 
just bake them for every fry it I think
it's<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.970> better<00:01:51.300> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.960> come<00:01:52.080> on<00:01:52.200> better

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it's a better I think it come on better

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.480 
it's a better I think it come on better
I<00:01:52.620> think<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.700> should<00:01:53.940> put<00:01:54.540> them<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> french

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
I think we should put them in the french

I think we should put them in the french
fries<00:01:56.490> Armour<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:58.820> know<00:01:59.820> before<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> fry
