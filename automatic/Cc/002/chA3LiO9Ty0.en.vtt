be used if you want to make a grid
that's<00:01:33.810> 5<00:01:34.080> by<00:01:34.289> 10<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.369> made<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> zinc

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that's 5 by 10 they are made of zinc

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.200 
that's 5 by 10 they are made of zinc
alloy<00:01:36.170> obviously<00:01:37.170> they're<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.560> heavy<00:01:38.280> noisy

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
alloy obviously they're very heavy noisy

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.810 
alloy obviously they're very heavy noisy
loud<00:01:39.630> clinky<00:01:40.439> I'd<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.039> very<00:01:41.189> cautious<00:01:41.490> about

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
loud clinky I'd be very cautious about

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.210 
loud clinky I'd be very cautious about
playing<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.539> on<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> wooden<00:01:43.110> table<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
playing with them on a wooden table the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.789 
playing with them on a wooden table the
box<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:44.880> come<00:01:45.179> in<00:01:45.360> has<00:01:46.110> these<00:01:46.440> round

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
box that they come in has these round

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.770 
box that they come in has these round
holes<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.459> it<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.179> store<00:01:48.539> them

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
holes in it so that you can store them

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
holes in it so that you can store them
in<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.500> problem<00:01:49.830> with<00:01:49.920> putting<00:01:50.069> them<00:01:50.280> in

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
in it the problem with putting them in

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.800 
in it the problem with putting them in
there<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.759> hard<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.600> so

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there is it's hard to get them out so

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.109 
there is it's hard to get them out so
you<00:01:51.899> simply<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.319> dump<00:01:52.560> them<00:01:52.709> out<00:01:52.799> again<00:01:53.119> being

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you simply the dump them out again being

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.240 
you simply the dump them out again being
careful<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.840> table<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
careful what table you do that on and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.639 
careful what table you do that on and
how<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.700> dump<00:01:57.000> them<00:01:57.149> out<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.649> gameplay

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
how you dump them out but gameplay

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.260 
how you dump them out but gameplay
itself<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.130> pick<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.490> person<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.819> go<00:01:59.970> first

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
itself you pick one person to go first

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.149 
itself you pick one person to go first
and<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.569> your<00:02:00.750> turn<00:02:00.959> you'll<00:02:01.500> take<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.860> cross

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and on your turn you'll take your cross

reason you want to capture pieces is
because<00:03:23.699> on<00:03:23.790> your<00:03:23.940> turn<00:03:24.090> if<00:03:24.239> you've<00:03:24.359> nowhere

because on your turn if you've nowhere
to<00:03:24.780> go<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.229> can

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
to go you can

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.500 
to go you can
sacrifice<00:03:26.370> three<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> pieces<00:03:27.330> that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
sacrifice three of the pieces that

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.500 
sacrifice three of the pieces that
you've<00:03:27.780> captured<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.530> place<00:03:29.490> one<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.210> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
you've captured and place one on the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.450 
you've captured and place one on the
board<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.260> maybe<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.710> can<00:03:31.890> land<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
board so that maybe you can land on the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.880 
board so that maybe you can land on the
spot<00:03:32.700> when<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.090> your<00:03:33.180> turn<00:03:33.710> this<00:03:34.710> will

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
spot when it's your turn this will

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.020 
spot when it's your turn this will
continue<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.430> every<00:03:35.610> player<00:03:35.820> has<00:03:35.850> been

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
continue to every player has been

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.180 
continue to every player has been
eliminated<00:03:36.210> but<00:03:36.570> one<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.560> player<00:03:37.890> is<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
eliminated but one that player is the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.480

to<00:03:41.580> be<00:03:41.670> one<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.300> collectors<00:03:42.750> are

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
to be one I think that collectors are

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.790 
to be one I think that collectors are
going<00:03:42.960> to<00:03:43.020> hand<00:03:43.170> out<00:03:43.290> because<00:03:43.590> they're<00:03:43.680> only

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
going to hand out because they're only

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.350 
going to hand out because they're only
100<00:03:44.220> copies<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.670> how<00:03:44.760> many<00:03:44.940> people<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.300> say

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
up and move your pieces around and it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.520 
up and move your pieces around and it
plays<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.850> rules<00:03:57.510> say<00:03:57.720> two<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.080> four<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:58.410> I'm

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
plays the rules say two to four but I'm

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.230 
plays the rules say two to four but I'm
telling<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:58.800> right<00:03:58.980> now<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.550> two<00:03:59.760> or

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
telling you right now it is a two or

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.420 
telling you right now it is a two or
four<00:04:00.930> game<00:04:01.230> three<00:04:01.860> player<00:04:02.070> doesn't<00:04:02.400> work

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
four game three player doesn't work

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.940 
four game three player doesn't work
because<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:03.540> person<00:04:03.750> who<00:04:04.050> is<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.440> between<00:04:04.560> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
because the person who is in between the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.410 
because the person who is in between the
corners<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.520> is<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> little<00:04:05.820> bit<00:04:06.120> shut<00:04:06.330> out

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
corners just is a little bit shut out

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.970 
corners just is a little bit shut out
it's<00:04:06.600> just<00:04:06.720> not<00:04:06.870> very<00:04:07.050> symmetrical<00:04:07.770> at<00:04:07.860> that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
it's just not very symmetrical at that

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.130 
it's just not very symmetrical at that
point<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.430> an<00:04:08.940> abstract<00:04:09.570> strategy<00:04:09.959> game

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
point and an abstract strategy game

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.650 
point and an abstract strategy game
should<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.470> somewhat<00:04:11.280> symmetrical<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.240> think

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
should be somewhat symmetrical I I think

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.199 
should be somewhat symmetrical I I think
perfectly<00:04:13.080> symmetrical<00:04:13.590> usually<00:04:14.209> the

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
perfectly symmetrical usually the

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.520 
perfectly symmetrical usually the
component<00:04:15.570> qaulity<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:15.959> high<00:04:16.140> but<00:04:16.410> the

component qaulity is high but the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.920

isn't<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.350> first<00:04:19.560> game<00:04:19.739> actually<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:20.130> use

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
and agonize over your moves it's really

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.170 
and agonize over your moves it's really
not<00:05:04.950> that<00:05:05.010> difficult<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.700> game<00:05:05.850> and<00:05:06.030> it's

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
not that difficult a game and it's

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.940 
not that difficult a game and it's
really<00:05:06.660> not<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:06.900> interesting<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.770> game

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
really not that interesting of a game

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.880 
really not that interesting of a game
for<00:05:08.190> me<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.490> think<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.270> concept<00:05:09.780> is<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.530> neat

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
for me I think the concept is a neat

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.070 
for me I think the concept is a neat
idea<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.550> it's<00:05:11.850> okay<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.210> can<00:05:12.450> do<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:12.870> pass<00:05:13.020> time

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
idea and it's okay I can do to pass time

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.250 
idea and it's okay I can do to pass time
because<00:05:13.710> it's<00:05:13.860> quick<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:14.130> easy<00:05:14.360> but<00:05:15.360> it

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
because it's quick and easy but it

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.890 
because it's quick and easy but it
almost<00:05:16.470> seems<00:05:17.030> shameful<00:05:18.030> that<00:05:18.210> we<00:05:18.360> use<00:05:18.570> such

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
almost seems shameful that we use such

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.710 
almost seems shameful that we use such
great<00:05:19.500> components<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.880> game<00:05:21.270> that's<00:05:21.450> just

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
great components for a game that's just

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.890 
great components for a game that's just
not<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.260> fantastic<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.940> Who<00:05:24.720> am<00:05:24.780> I

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
not that fantastic so Who am I

not that fantastic so Who am I
