00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
let's take a saber out his head can go

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.840 
let's take a saber out his head can go
360<00:02:57.140> go<00:02:58.140> out<00:02:58.230> at<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.440> shoulder<00:02:59.100> turn<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
360 go out at the shoulder turn it the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.190 
360 go out at the shoulder turn it the
shoulder<00:03:02.000> turn<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.180> forearm<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:03.990> there

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
shoulder turn the forearm right there

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.860 
shoulder turn the forearm right there
and<00:03:04.440> at<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.770> elbow<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:06.060> also<00:03:06.180> bend<00:03:06.720> at<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and at the elbow can also bend at the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.540 
and at the elbow can also bend at the
elbow<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.350> torso<00:03:10.400> articulation<00:03:11.400> right

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
elbow is a torso articulation right

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.930 
elbow is a torso articulation right
there<00:03:12.500> let's<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:13.680> forward<00:03:14.130> go<00:03:14.280> back<00:03:14.520> down<00:03:14.910> to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
there let's go forward go back down to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.540 
there let's go forward go back down to
knee<00:03:15.270> turn<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.930> knee<00:03:16.290> turn<00:03:16.890> at<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.190> ankle<00:03:17.959> um

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
knee turn the knee turn at the ankle um

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.620 
knee turn the knee turn at the ankle um
with<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:20.760> figure<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> think<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.510> he's<00:03:21.600> a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
with this figure I think and he's a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.330 
with this figure I think and he's a
little<00:03:21.870> bit<00:03:21.959> more<00:03:22.110> leg<00:03:22.500> articulation<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
little bit more leg articulation the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.120 
little bit more leg articulation the
legs<00:03:23.550> should<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:23.790> able<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.180> out<00:03:24.590> because<00:03:25.590> he

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
legs should be able to go out because he

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
legs should be able to go out because he
is<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.680> way<00:03:28.830> he<00:03:29.040> moves<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.580> in<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.790> movies

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
is a the way he moves like in the movies

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.840 
is a the way he moves like in the movies
he's<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> freaking<00:03:31.290> ninja<00:03:31.440> for<00:03:32.400> goodness<00:03:32.670> sake

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
he's a freaking ninja for goodness sake

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.060 
he's a freaking ninja for goodness sake
so<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.270> little<00:03:34.020> bit<00:03:34.170> more<00:03:34.290> articulation<00:03:34.770> in

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
so a little bit more articulation in

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.729
