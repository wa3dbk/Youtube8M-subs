overall stats 89 agility not the best in
the<00:01:14.520> world<00:01:14.670> he<00:01:14.790> saw<00:01:14.970> his<00:01:15.060> elusiveness<00:01:15.479> pretty

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the world he saw his elusiveness pretty

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.550 
the world he saw his elusiveness pretty
pretty<00:01:16.259> low<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.220> once<00:01:17.490> he<00:01:17.549> catches<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.090> ball

pretty low so once he catches the ball
don't<00:01:19.560> expect<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.850> know<00:01:20.970> breaking

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
don't expect to be you know breaking

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
don't expect to be you know breaking
tackles<00:01:21.659> left<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.070> mean<00:01:23.250> yeah

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
tackles left and right i mean yeah

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.260 
tackles left and right i mean yeah
you're<00:01:23.640> gonna<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.850> able<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> put<00:01:24.150> some

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you're gonna be able to put some

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.260 
you're gonna be able to put some
maneuvers<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.810> people<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> think

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
maneuvers on people but what I think

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
maneuvers on people but what I think
again<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> second<00:01:28.170> most<00:01:28.259> important<00:01:28.740> thing<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
again the second most important thing to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
again the second most important thing to
what<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.939> makes<00:01:30.150> 93<00:01:30.659> Walker<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.409> now

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
what I think makes 93 Walker as of now

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.050 
what I think makes 93 Walker as of now
the<00:01:31.590> best<00:01:31.890> receiver<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> game<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.610> his

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the best receiver in the game is his

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.840 
the best receiver in the game is his
elusiveness<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:34.020> his<00:01:34.170> ability<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.950> create

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
elusiveness in his ability to create

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.210 
elusiveness in his ability to create
missed<00:01:36.270> tackles<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.799> very

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
missed tackles you know up it's very

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
missed tackles you know up it's very
hard<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.939> person<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.420> bring<00:01:39.689> Welker<00:01:40.140> down

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
hard for one person to bring Welker down

just slip away from him you know lucidum
definitely<00:03:40.740> has<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> part<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.100> do<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.400> so

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
definitely has a part to do with that so

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
know get by some people a balky revision

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.730 
know get by some people a balky revision
I'm<00:03:50.760> that's<00:03:51.090> mainly<00:03:51.810> good<00:03:52.140> for<00:03:52.320> running<00:03:52.560> backs

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
I'm that's mainly good for running backs

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.040 
I'm that's mainly good for running backs
to<00:03:52.950> our<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.760> there's<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.000> small<00:03:54.600> gap<00:03:54.930> they're

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
to our if there's a small gap they're

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
to our if there's a small gap they're
gonna<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.260> able<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.470> squeeze<00:03:55.770> right<00:03:56.010> through

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
gonna be able to squeeze right through

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.890 
gonna be able to squeeze right through
so<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:56.610> receiver<00:03:56.910> that's<00:03:57.120> definitely<00:03:57.600> pretty

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
so for receiver that's definitely pretty

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.040 
so for receiver that's definitely pretty
good<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.320> stiff<00:03:59.070> arm<00:03:59.280> no<00:04:00.270> not<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.690> best<00:04:00.870> but

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
good a stiff arm no not the best but

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.780 
good a stiff arm no not the best but
again<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:01.980> know<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.160> don't<00:04:02.370> get<00:04:02.550> this<00:04:02.610> card

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
again you know you don't get this card

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.449 
again you know you don't get this card
to<00:04:02.820> step<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.150> spin<00:04:03.750> move<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.080> pretty<00:04:04.440> high<00:04:04.650> Juke

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
to step on spin move is pretty high Juke

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.180 
to step on spin move is pretty high Juke
move<00:04:05.510> pretty<00:04:06.510> high<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.230> again<00:04:08.070> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
move pretty high so again the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.920 
move pretty high so again the
elusiveness<00:04:08.700> isn't<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.420> for<00:04:09.600> him<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.810> be

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
elusiveness isn't there for him to be

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.750 
elusiveness isn't there for him to be
breaking<00:04:10.230> those<00:04:10.350> manual<00:04:10.770> tackles<00:04:11.220> but<00:04:11.430> his

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760

Juke<00:04:12.060> Norman<00:04:12.360> spin<00:04:12.600> move<00:04:12.750> was<00:04:12.870> definitely

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
Juke Norman spin move was definitely

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.930 
Juke Norman spin move was definitely
high<00:04:13.500> enough<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:14.340> where<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.640> could<00:04:14.790> perform

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
high enough to where you could perform

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.330 
high enough to where you could perform
these<00:04:15.300> actions<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.109> know<00:04:16.260> get<00:04:16.830> by<00:04:16.980> folks
