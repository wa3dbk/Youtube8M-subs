00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.450
 and what happens, people are my mark and today 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.349
 I bring a modern warfare gameplay 2 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:09.480
 it's a little special game 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:12.690
 basically it explains to us if above what 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.580
 that is good is was not well to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 only with the knife with the knife 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.600
 tactical in this case of the m9 and with the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.450
 throwing knife 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.040
 I would not be a fit to try 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.080
 have a little more variety to my channel 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.600
 and then the first thing that came to my mind was 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.180
 that 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.190
 and for what reason I do not know basically 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.960
 I like more how the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.489
 those who are the dolls of this game do not 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.070
 I know the breasts I find much better in 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.600
 the modern warfare 3 on the knife in my 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.269
 opinion is 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.489
 it's fatal to me I 'm not 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.960
 able to kill with him so 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.809
 I decided to come to the bale motors that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.820
 pal knife is one thing is a game 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.859
 quite powerful for the wicket 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.829
 let's leave it impotent because with the 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.449
 command already if the next level is no longer 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.250
 it's a knife we already have a katana 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.479
 directly but good in this case 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.000
 for not going to use much of the knife 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.549
 so I put in I put on strong marathon 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.619
 ahead not because it's not good 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.420
 second I do not know how logical it would be to weight 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.030
 lightweight if lightweight there you see it in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.789
 screen and the third then ninja command 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.450
 I tell you, it would be very abusive and now 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.450
 I have to tell you 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 in the past week 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.260
 good does things two weeks a week 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.540
 last above all I tried 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.540
 I tried so I do not know how many times already but 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 let's try it again is to upload a 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.270
 video every day two video every two days and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.370
 what happened what I did what I did 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.670
 always things of not a week we go no 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.380
 I arrived not even 1 last week 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.380
 whenever I try to do things like that 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.399
 attentive to the campero of the corner and 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.750
 you will see how it came out is incredible follows 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.220
 having campera thing in this game not 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.080
 we have gone the module in strong yet 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.490
 and there they see that the blind blind 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.370
 blind and tied it brown with less 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.830
 and good going back to the subject of before 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.900
 I already liked the title with the theme of 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.310
 before I do myself I usually is amazing 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.819
 the little capacity that I have for 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.370
 remember then the things that I speak 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.680
 and if I always try to upload a 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.329
 video every day every two days and not what 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.159
 I get and that what happens after 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.799
 get it because it happened to me like a 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.329
 week half week without uploading anything in 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.250
 this case the last video that uploaded has 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.610
 been Saturday 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.120
 and good with everything that already so far 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.770
 but come on, I'll give them to you tomorrow though 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.660
 well tomorrow would be today because you 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.090
 you are watching and the video is all a bit 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.400
 paranoia this 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.980
 well that notes give me the notes of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.680
 Friday and I have more time to 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.189
 play for 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.379
 record to upload and all those things 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:55.069
 then I will try to record the egg 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.680
 of videos to leave to leave them 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.659
 already up for when it started again 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.549
 the institute has time to play and 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.099
 to record then you will have the 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.569
 gameplays I will have to fuck this and that 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.849
 I speak fatal , I will have what I say 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.159
 prepared and that more things above 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.099
 the game whenever I go in this I do still 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.489
 first 450 points right now I do not know 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.489
 how many casualties 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.900
 and well the title of the video you can see 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.599
 how to ruin a game 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.750
 basically that's the perfect game or 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.879
 be 9 to 2 I think I was going and then as 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.430
 whenever you will have beautiful things in 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.890
 life because always almost always has 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.030
 than having something that comes better in this 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.519
 case the account of the station was closed 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.750
 network I dropped I tried to reopen 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.640
 because this game many times if I 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.810
 you try to open it so it can continue 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.599
 playing in the game without you throwing 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.859
 but there was no luck it was weird it was weird 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.530
 because if I was not playing yes that 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:56.040
 I would have sure we are going but nothing is not 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.079
 he wanted to reopen and then as no 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.459
 I would have been able because I will bring a 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.930
 video where it is first only with the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.400
 knife and there's nothing you see that closes 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.370
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.689
 give like favorite if you want more and 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.689
 holy and good until next week
