home of aussie plums which is a
fermented<00:02:59.840> japanese<00:03:00.470> conv<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:01.970> is

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
fermented japanese conv and so this is

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.729 
fermented japanese conv and so this is
really<00:03:02.299> it<00:03:02.570> has<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.750> lot<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.959> alkalinizing

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
really it has a lot of alkalinizing

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.140 
really it has a lot of alkalinizing

John is John I think eventually gave the
plantains<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.299> thumbs<00:03:08.540> down

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
um healthy drinks out of the carton of

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.630 
um healthy drinks out of the carton of
milk<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.290> has<00:03:15.410> optimising<00:03:16.220> properties

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
milk so it has optimising properties

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.160 
milk so it has optimising properties
which<00:03:16.820> reduce<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.239> acidity<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.780> body<00:03:17.810> and

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
which reduce the acidity in the body and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.509 
which reduce the acidity in the body and
so<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.530> good<00:03:18.709> for<00:03:18.739> helping<00:03:19.100> with<00:03:19.130> fatigue

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
so this is good for helping with fatigue

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
clear plantains are not just I don't

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.539 
clear plantains are not just I don't
need<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.810> spill<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.260> ate<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.799> butt<00:04:03.069> end<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.430> it

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
need to spill I ate the butt end of it

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:10.050 
need to spill I ate the butt end of it
and<00:04:03.639> it<00:04:03.700> wasn't<00:04:03.849> remotely<00:04:04.389> ripe<00:04:04.959> yet<00:04:09.060> which

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
and it wasn't remotely ripe yet which

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
so I'm not sure this is exactly how you

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.310 
so I'm not sure this is exactly how you
were<00:04:21.880> yeah<00:04:22.599> I<00:04:22.780> think<00:04:22.990> you're<00:04:23.110> supposed<00:04:23.199> to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
were yeah I think you're supposed to

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.870 
were yeah I think you're supposed to
cook<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.710> two<00:04:23.800> things<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.130> put<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.669> in<00:04:24.729> my

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
cook it in two things I put it in my

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.180 
cook it in two things I put it in my
pancake<00:04:25.479> section<00:04:25.960> well<00:04:26.620> yeah<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:26.979> a<00:04:27.039> low

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
pancake section well yeah it's a low

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.189 
pancake section well yeah it's a low
glycemic<00:04:27.370> index<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.300> comparison<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.080> other

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
glycemic index and comparison to other

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:53.249 
glycemic index and comparison to other
sorts<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.710> like<00:04:29.889> like<00:04:30.099> white<00:04:30.280> flour<00:04:52.259> are

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
sorts of like like white flour are

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.430 
sorts of like like white flour are
usually<00:04:53.740> by<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.919> way<00:04:54.659> as<00:04:55.659> a<00:04:55.720> flower<00:04:56.050> for

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
usually by the way as a flower for

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.480 
usually by the way as a flower for
chicken<00:05:00.630> give<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.780> thumbs<00:05:01.990> up<00:05:02.169> but<00:05:03.130> cook<00:05:03.340> it

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
chicken give it a thumbs up but cook it

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.249 
chicken give it a thumbs up but cook it
in<00:05:03.610> things<00:05:03.849> not<00:05:04.380> eat<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:06.310> straight<00:05:06.490> mm-hmm

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
in things not eat it straight mm-hmm

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.740 
in things not eat it straight mm-hmm
lastly<00:05:08.259> is<00:05:08.669> cricket<00:05:09.669> so<00:05:09.940> scientists<00:05:10.389> predict

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
lastly is cricket so scientists predict

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.540 
lastly is cricket so scientists predict
that<00:05:10.870> as<00:05:11.169> population<00:05:11.740> increases<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:12.370> will<00:05:12.490> our

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
that as population increases so will our

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.300 
that as population increases so will our
demand<00:05:12.880> for<00:05:13.030> meat<00:05:13.210> products<00:05:13.860> but<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.070> problem

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
demand for meat products but the problem

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.879 
demand for meat products but the problem
with<00:05:15.400> meat<00:05:15.520> products<00:05:15.940> is<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:16.120> they<00:05:16.889> create

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
with meat products is that they create

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.560 
with meat products is that they create
methane<00:05:18.099> emissions<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.729> pollution<00:05:18.759> and<00:05:19.509> so

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
methane emissions and pollution and so

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.700 
methane emissions and pollution and so
we're<00:05:19.690> gonna<00:05:19.780> need<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.080> find<00:05:20.259> alternative

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
we're gonna need to find alternative

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.279 
we're gonna need to find alternative
sources<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:21.099> protein<00:05:21.930> introducing<00:05:22.930> they

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
sources of protein introducing they

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.629 
sources of protein introducing they
crickets<00:05:23.800> which<00:05:24.039> are<00:05:24.190> high<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.520> protein

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
crickets which are high in protein

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.420 
crickets which are high in protein
without<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.449> carbon<00:05:25.840> footprint<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:26.800> for

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
without the carbon footprint and for

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.089 
without the carbon footprint and for
this<00:05:27.550> one<00:05:27.849> I'm<00:05:28.120> gonna<00:05:28.449> bow<00:05:28.750> out<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.320> let<00:05:29.710> John

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
this one I'm gonna bow out and let John

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.370 
this one I'm gonna bow out and let John
oh<00:05:30.310> do<00:05:30.370> you<00:05:30.550> do<00:05:30.699> not<00:05:30.909> use<00:05:31.120> my<00:05:31.330> thing<00:05:31.840> before<00:05:32.199> the

oh do you do not use my thing before the

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.310 
oh do you do not use my thing before the
crickets<00:05:32.770> no<00:05:33.009> I<00:05:33.159> may<00:05:33.310> use<00:05:33.460> it<00:05:33.580> after<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.090> grave

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
crickets no I may use it after the grave

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.740 
crickets no I may use it after the grave
nope<00:05:35.320> that's<00:05:36.219> that<00:05:36.460> backwash<00:05:36.909> you<00:05:37.419> want<00:05:37.599> my
