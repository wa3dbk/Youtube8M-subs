00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Today we are to the airport in Tegel 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.279
 ridden in berlin around us the consequences of 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.029
 pilot strikes at lufthansa 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.230
 to look 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.090
 In three days, there will be three 1,800 flights 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.469
 Lufthansa made a close half million 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.240
 people are affected 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.640
 Of course that will solve a huge one 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.710
 discussion from the largest ever 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.210
 strike of which Lufthansa affected 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.119
 is and now we'll take a look 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.920
 little bit 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.279
 here at gate 11 equal hit three 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.779
 well-known flights of Lufthansa or Moscow 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.430
 cologne bonn and dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.360
 and if you are here in the now 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.210
 hall looks around there are a few 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.770
 tourists and a few visitors and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.250
 otherwise it is measured by the usual 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.930
 state of the airport pretty much orphaned 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 three days pilot strike at the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.289
 Lufthansa, what do you think about it? 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.969
 I do not think much of ah you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.670
 You could earn that very well 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.309
 regulate in a different way and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 not that everyone is here and 425,000 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.469
 Germans do not fly and they 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.840
 self-affected 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.670
 yes I should pick someone up and wait 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.930
 I've only had that for three hours 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.700
 The news is that there now 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.229
 field beds are set up so I 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.150
 if i know my thing mexican now 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 I come here to change must be 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.930
 not informed and so find that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.460
 I'm not alright so your strikes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.380
 things are ok, everyone wants more 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.159
 But I do not think that's okay 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.780
 always find that the uninvolved 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.520
 it must be suffered 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.380
 the right to not understand there system 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.080
 yes, I think that's not good, but 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.990
 first negotiate and then then 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.380
 strike or take action 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.909
 constitutionally this is her good 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.860
 right from article 9 paragraph 2 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.210
 So there is no political one 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.159
 opportunities even if they are privileged 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 and most of them are not deprived 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.100
 strike because they are stupid 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.750
 that is the problem halt the Lufthansa 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.520
 is not some company that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.159
 Lufthansa is a company of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 national rank of decisive 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.649
 importance for the mobility of a whole 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.960
 society 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.360
 that's why the cdu already has it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 call for a legal intervention in the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.369
 strike law I find that perfect 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.259
 besides the strike right is sacred it 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
 is one of the mainstays of ours 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.000
 Constitution has just one of the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.020
 questioned passengers here rightly 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.060
 detected 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.619
 But I can find the policy 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.390
 Of course not easy to watch though 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.650
 she plays something like that when at the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.599
 Lufthansa or the railway 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.209
 is on strike with profound 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.819
 effects on traffic throughout the country 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.150
 then politics must be the collective bargaining parties 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.250
 Get to a table and convey that 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.409
 is my opinion of the task 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.489
 this would be the case of the 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.819
 transport minister 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.230
 what is the name of the man who does not know the name 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.810
 alexander dobrindt 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.609
 So please sir dobrindt do it yourself 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.609
 known it simple
