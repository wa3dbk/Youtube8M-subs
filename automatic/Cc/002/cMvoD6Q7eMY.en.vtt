00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.109
 by holding weekly four tips on how you de 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.109
 by creating a correct plan 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.480
 hello and welcome to the cricket tv's 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.339
 Peaceful Decline show on the internet 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.199
 my name is he , thank you 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.519
 turned back many has indeed the 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.140
 i need to know someone i am 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.300
 who is always planning again and again 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.340
 and everything has planned and always 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 again puts on structures and I have 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.220
 always call a diary 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.230
 always possible things 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.489
 small town many have got there 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.989
 not really the time for it 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.059
 actually a pity I have a lot of 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.159
 experience made the rats in 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.750
 and want but want to make the diet 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.430
 actually say I have none 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.890
 time to make the plan 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.359
 I'll do it the day after tomorrow or or or 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.800
 it's just too exhausting and me 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.850
 I do not know what I'm doing in there 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.929
 I still should enter 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.219
 but I think it's really very 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.079
 important to make a plan because 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.600
 my diet starts because it's easy 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.940
 belongs to it because prepare there too 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.340
 should make a diet if somehow 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.630
 No plan has, so to speak, or even 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.070
 No preparation in advance 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.899
 gone so thought that made too 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.950
 then it's just that city 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.810
 probably will not work either 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.179
 I have it today because of it 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.640
 Also for tips as you on the day 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.009
 The best way to do it is if you are just that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.720
 sun a plan created in first 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.970
 Tip that I can give you there 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.549
 rather in the beginning ask what goals have 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.170
 that means you have the right goal 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.340
 or short-term goal that is to say 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.899
 example say okay i want to now 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.820
 be sure to meet in six months 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.670
 june meet from my work colleagues 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.469
 or what five years or something like that 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.680
 meet inter meet all right 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.090
 be slim short term goal 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.700
 of course his plan is a bit too 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.079
 being strictly there as a long-term goal 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.600
 For example, if you say in two 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.280
 years my sister and I have to go in 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 two years somehow must be thin 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.880
 and that's why you should be first 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.670
 ask for your plan 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.170
 A goal I have the second tip 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 I can give you that is you too 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.329
 look what carrier you have that is 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.459
 There are usually so many people 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.560
 have we have a clear hunger then one has 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 Of course, always want to any 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.860
 lusts and easily reaches for snacks and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.540
 but it is important to know what 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.849
 start in which situations 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.050
 are you doing that that is on which one 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.030
 emotional association is that 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.459
 mostly emotional situations circled 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.620
 it's somehow back to snacks 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.959
 stress has it with a man or friend 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.120
 or still find work 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.440
 somehow the last one somehow 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.150
 not given report what needs to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.459
 work or in front of the television 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.989
 when does influence next correctly 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.410
 to write out a loan because you know 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.000
 then just just the situation 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.890
 and great s just just better plan 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.239
 that he handle it and accordingly 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.370
 Of course, then not quite so saw 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.010
 also narrow theirs in one 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.569
 preparatory phase the third is the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.069
 can not give her is that you too 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.220
 something behind the weak spots 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.319
 Of course, everyone has expertise and is 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.780
 clearly in a suspicious 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.090
 or sweets that's just important 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.340
 if you then somehow weak 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.690
 have that you look anyway though 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.730
 they do not come up to them 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.549
 somehow do not think anyway 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.200
 tastes that says this great but me 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.209
 can not be real but that you just 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.370
 then take these emotions and say 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.920
 okay I'm full of love for Cuba, I should 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.870
 that means I am sweet guy eighth 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.100
 namely the apple because it just like that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.230
 apple, of course, also fructose 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.139
 inside and he is also full and can 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.150
 just say okay if you have to say that 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.340
 imex quality somehow something great and 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.319
 is working 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.450
 in healthy food and watch that 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.519
 I just when I help something 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.750
 For example, derogatory renovate one 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.090
 bought for example also very with 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.709
 I 'll work with you with a fourth tip 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.290
 In any case , that can go away is that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.450
 you just look what do you expect so 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.250
 that means you can of course in the beginning 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.379
 im planning and say okay i am now 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.420
 someone who now informs great food 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.840
 But he wants to be vegan in three weeks 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.090
 his 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.670
 of course that's a bit more blatant 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.180
 Of course, very high set 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.650
 aim 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.970
 So you should really 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.500
 Pay attention to what you also here , however 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.989
 at your table with your experience 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.579
 that you really say okay 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.709
 when I rest in the whole day 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.880
 and works eating before 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.799
 that 's really more and more 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.239
 will sign because it is so natural 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.739
 in this processing of them 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.560
 of course a lot of things 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.520
 also addictive made from sugar or 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.380
 Of course it is flavor enhancer 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.340
 just that's just a process 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.169
 to getting used to 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.729
 that's why you 're really looking for it 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.740
 so plan make that easy 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.990
 Showers expected by themselves and that 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.630
 Realistically, if you are 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.490
 Of course, even more tips have powerful 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.260
 to the nutrition plan view that means 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.419
 video analysis a healthy diet so 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.280
 could look like this again in your plan 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.900
 What you could do to free everything is 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.610
 I recommend this food to you 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.340
 video in this video pretty much the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.539
 Anyway, markets are kind of healthy anyway 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.099
 food and nutrition issues 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.729
 It can be easy to quote in that 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.229
 video in 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.610
 I would definitely be happy and 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.830
 Of course I am happy if these four 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.400
 Many of them initially burned 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.840
 put 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.760
 Of course, I'm happy about the wide 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.860
 Comment from you and of course if 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.210
 my video like you are a few days 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.510
 again I look forward to is there 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.510
 vincis
