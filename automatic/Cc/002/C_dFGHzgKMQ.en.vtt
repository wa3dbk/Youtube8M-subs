00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
we're going to drag the saturation down

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.529 
we're going to drag the saturation down
all<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.340> way<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.459> zero<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.149> also<00:02:09.300> input

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
all the way to zero you can also input

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.900 
all the way to zero you can also input
zero<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.459> come<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.730> here

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
see that it is a it's kind of pretty

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.170 
see that it is a it's kind of pretty
dark<00:02:47.380> here<00:02:47.470> under<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.550> leaves<00:02:48.730> where<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
dark here under the leaves where the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.750 
dark here under the leaves where the
color<00:02:49.360> may<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.900> varied<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.380> small<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.830> so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
color may have varied to small of it so

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.640 
color may have varied to small of it so
we're<00:02:51.880> going<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.090> come<00:02:52.420> down<00:02:52.600> here<00:02:52.810> where<00:02:53.560> it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
we're going to come down here where it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.040 
we're going to come down here where it
says<00:02:53.680> limit<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.550> now<00:02:55.540> we're<00:02:55.660> going<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.840> it's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
says limit you now we're going to it's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.500 
says limit you now we're going to it's
normally<00:02:56.680> set<00:02:56.860> at<00:02:56.980> ten<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.060> see<00:02:58.300> if<00:02:58.390> you

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
normally set at ten you can see if you

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.620 
normally set at ten you can see if you
adjust<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.020> width<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.730> color<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.390> pink

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
adjust the width the color of the pink

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.760 
adjust the width the color of the pink
begins<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.140> spread<00:03:02.440> now<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.959> can<00:03:05.080> see<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.530> if

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
begins to spread now you can see that if

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.350 
begins to spread now you can see that if
you<00:03:06.040> adjust<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.550> all<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.850> way<00:03:06.940> your<00:03:07.150> color

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
you adjust it all the way your color

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.610 
you adjust it all the way your color
green<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.810> blue<00:03:07.959> is<00:03:08.020> going<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.320> come<00:03:08.440> back

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
green and blue is going to come back

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.590 
green and blue is going to come back
we're<00:03:09.550> going<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.790> try<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.090> make<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:10.570> that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
we're going to try and make it so that

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.120 
we're going to try and make it so that
we<00:03:10.870> keep<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.350> black<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.770> white<00:03:11.890> in<00:03:12.040> the
