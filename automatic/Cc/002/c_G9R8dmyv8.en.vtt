 on 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.929
 we hear from so much 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.869
 everything we have especially 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.559
 arsenal 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.559
 therefor 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.029
 the latter a successor it 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.199
 but you get one 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.759
 the 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.130
 the euro 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.150
 but whatever the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 hopefully now looks almelo 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.309
 women have for tents 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.420

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.140
 rw 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.089
 the cards are 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.560
 looking for the accident on the euro 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.069
 droste summer reporter 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:54.280
 with each other 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 8 to shorten its head a bystander 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 what are you up to 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 that made 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.620
 I'm ali 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.130
 worked on design for years 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
 Unfortunately 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 that's what she's been through 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.490
 for people who end up on the street 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.650
 we don't think about it 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.600
 but about the possibilities 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.670
 is free 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.120
 but yes in this system can enter a series 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.110
 to sit 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.450
 the controversial law 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.430
 of course we hope it is right there with open arms being designed i 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.180
 am with my goals and we hope to recommend the rider 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.410
 villarreal 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.620
 the depoldering third place sample 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.910
 there are rules 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.910
 they were mierlo 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 horner 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.439
 I also become the public interest no 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.549
 becomes mbokani in italy that means 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.119
