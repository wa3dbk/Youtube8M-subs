so<00:00:26.340> there's<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> five<00:00:26.939> basics<00:00:27.480> guys<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:28.050> stay

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
so there's a five basics guys just stay

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
so there's a five basics guys just stay
Sonya<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.580> knee<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.390> we're<00:00:30.539> looking<00:00:30.599> at

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
Sonya one knee when we're looking at

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.569 
Sonya one knee when we're looking at
checking<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.619> be<00:00:31.710> confident<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.430> whole

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
checking we got to be confident a whole

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.010 
checking we got to be confident a whole
bunch<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.850> different<00:00:32.910> skills<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.480> hockey<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
bunch of different skills at hockey the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.720 
bunch of different skills at hockey the
very<00:00:34.260> first<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.700> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
very first one what do you think it is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.889 
very first one what do you think it is
what<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.480> standing<00:00:36.690> up

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
what do you do when you're standing up

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.290 
what do you do when you're standing up
we're<00:00:37.559> skating<00:00:37.829> right<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.790> skating<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we're skating right so skating is the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.690 
we're skating right so skating is the
most<00:00:39.809> basic<00:00:40.230> component<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.010> checking<00:00:41.399> skills

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
most basic component of checking skills

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.010 
most basic component of checking skills
and<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.329> checking<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.840> not

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and when you think of checking it's not

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
and when you think of checking it's not
just<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.500> driving<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> guy<00:00:44.520> into<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.789> boards

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
just about driving a guy into the boards

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 
just about driving a guy into the boards
it's<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.289> separating<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> mound

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it's really about separating the mound

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
it's really about separating the mound
from<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> puck<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> skating

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
from the puck so if we have the skating

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.810 
from the puck so if we have the skating
ability<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.890> push<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> person<00:00:50.700> from

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
ability we can push the person from

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.549 
ability we can push the person from
where<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.239> are<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> ice<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.199> where<00:00:52.350> we

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
where they are on the ice to where we

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
where they are on the ice to where we
want<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.250> which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.820> usually<00:00:54.149> from

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
want them to go which is usually from

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
want them to go which is usually from
the<00:00:54.449> middle<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> ice<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.590> outside<00:00:56.100> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the middle of the ice to the outside of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
the middle of the ice to the outside of
the<00:00:56.370> ACE<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:57.300> doing<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> when<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.320> moving

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the ACE by doing that when we're moving

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.049 
the ACE by doing that when we're moving
middle<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.010> outside<00:00:59.399> we're<00:00:59.760> working<00:00:59.850> on

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
middle to the outside we're working on

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
middle to the outside we're working on
the<00:01:00.210> next<00:01:00.359> step<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.870> positioning<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the next step which is positioning and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
the next step which is positioning and
angling<00:01:02.129> once<00:01:02.760> we've<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> position<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
angling once we've got the position and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570 
angling once we've got the position and
the<00:01:04.110> angle<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> guy<00:01:04.739> then<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the angle on the guy then what do you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
the angle on the guy then what do you
think<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.689> there<00:01:06.840> take<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
think we can do and go in there take the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080 
think we can do and go in there take the
puck<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> usually<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> take

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
puck way right and usually we can take

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.609 
puck way right and usually we can take
the<00:01:09.210> puck<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.049> basic<00:01:10.229> stick

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the puck way just with your basic stick

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.020 
the puck way just with your basic stick
check<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> drive<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> guy

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
check we don't have to drive the guy

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
check we don't have to drive the guy
into<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> boards<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.930> guys<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.260> still<00:01:13.409> an

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
into the boards you guys are still an

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.109 
into the boards you guys are still an
atom<00:01:13.830> getting<00:01:14.040> ready<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> go<00:01:14.430> into<00:01:14.580> PE<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
atom getting ready to go into PE and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.450 
atom getting ready to go into PE and
next<00:01:16.049> year<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.380> start<00:01:16.590> hitting<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.220> even

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
next year we can start hitting so even

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.950 
next year we can start hitting so even
an<00:01:17.549> atom<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.509> use<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> nice

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
an atom we can go in there use a nice

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
an atom we can go in there use a nice
stick<00:01:19.229> check<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.740> maybe<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.330> bit

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
stick check and maybe use a little bit

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.530 
stick check and maybe use a little bit
of<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> rub<00:01:21.979> driving<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> guy<00:01:23.159> into<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.939> boards

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
of a rub driving the guy into the boards

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030 
of a rub driving the guy into the boards
but<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.840> too<00:01:25.049> hard<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> referee

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
but not too hard so that the referee

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.469 
but not too hard so that the referee
doesn't<00:01:26.189> put<00:01:26.400> us<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> penalty<00:01:26.970> box<00:01:27.060> right
