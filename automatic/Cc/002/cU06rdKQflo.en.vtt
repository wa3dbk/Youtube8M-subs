campsites<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.760> there's<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.420> piece<00:00:21.689> here

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
campsites so there's a piece here

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.570 
campsites so there's a piece here
there's<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.410> piece<00:00:22.680> here<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:28.310> but<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.460> I'm

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
there's a piece here and but what I'm

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.460 
there's a piece here and but what I'm
guessing<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.539> they<00:00:30.689> came<00:00:30.900> across<00:00:31.019> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
guessing is as they came across this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.790 
guessing is as they came across this
hill<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.309> kind<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.640> high<00:00:32.820> hill

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
hill right here it's kind of a high hill

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.139 
hill right here it's kind of a high hill
they<00:00:34.800> come<00:00:35.010> over<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.340> hill<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.850> stopped

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
they come over this hill they stopped

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600 
they come over this hill they stopped
off<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.630> side<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> trail<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.829> they

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
off to the side of the trail and they

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.310 
off to the side of the trail and they
probably<00:00:38.850> camped<00:00:39.270> overnight<00:00:39.629> there's<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.140> nice

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
probably camped overnight there's a nice
