gonna show you just a few places where

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.050

the<00:00:18.359> mannequins<00:00:18.690> normally<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.699> yeah

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the mannequins normally are and so yeah

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.450 
the mannequins normally are and so yeah
they<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:22.260> hard<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.710> spot<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.430> of

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
they are a little hard to spot some of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
they are a little hard to spot some of
the<00:00:23.670> ones<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.029> aren't<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.539> obvious<00:00:24.769> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the ones that aren't as obvious the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.929 
the ones that aren't as obvious the
reason<00:00:26.099> being<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.880> see

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
reason being is because as you can see

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.200 
reason being is because as you can see
Newtown<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.720> fucked<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.429> mannequins

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
Newtown is fucked up and the mannequins

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.609 
Newtown is fucked up and the mannequins
aren't<00:00:30.420> really<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:30.720> brightest<00:00:31.050> colorful<00:00:31.500> as

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
aren't really as brightest colorful as

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
aren't really as brightest colorful as
they<00:00:31.710> used<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.369> they're<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:32.969> be

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
they used to be so they're gonna be

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.479 
they used to be so they're gonna be
hiding<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.870> some<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.590> weird<00:00:34.800> corners<00:00:35.309> here

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

houses outside I do believe there's one
in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.479> shed<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.350> open<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
in the shed that you can open when you

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.620 
in the shed that you can open when you
open<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> shed<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> power<00:01:21.450> up

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
open the shed to get the power up

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.270 
open the shed to get the power up

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
there's one sometimes back there there's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.999 
there's one sometimes back there there's
one<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.580> car<00:01:24.380> just<00:01:25.380> picture<00:01:25.710> his<00:01:25.830> head

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
fell off but yeah guys the thing I
recommend<00:01:29.369> most<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.240> you're<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.420> able<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
recommend most is if you're not able to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.179 
recommend most is if you're not able to
get<00:01:31.140> these<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:32.759> take<00:01:33.540> your<00:01:33.840> time<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.770> very

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
get these just take your time it's very

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
get these just take your time it's very
frustrating<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:36.119> took<00:01:36.299> me<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> while<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:36.900> I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
frustrating it took me a while because I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.690 
frustrating it took me a while because I
kept<00:01:37.290> quitting<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.159> thinking<00:01:38.549> that's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
kept quitting out thinking that's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.890 
kept quitting out thinking that's
