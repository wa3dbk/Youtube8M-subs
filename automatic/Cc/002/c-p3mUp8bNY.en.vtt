piece<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.769> white<00:00:20.099> paper<00:00:20.369> then<00:00:21.710> transfer<00:00:22.710> that

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
piece of white paper then transfer that

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.999 
piece of white paper then transfer that
stencil<00:00:23.220> onto<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.789> thicker<00:00:24.119> piece<00:00:24.419> of

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
stencil onto a thicker piece of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.159 
stencil onto a thicker piece of
construction<00:00:26.009> paper<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.939> thin<00:00:27.300> cardboard

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.439 

begin<00:00:31.940> with<00:00:32.940> making<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.660> regular<00:00:34.530> triangle

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
begin with making a regular triangle

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.330 
begin with making a regular triangle
regular<00:00:36.449> triangle<00:00:36.930> means<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.469> sides<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
regular triangle means all sides are the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
regular triangle means all sides are the
same<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> our<00:00:39.750> sides<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.289> 4<00:00:40.620> inches<00:00:40.890> in

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
same and our sides will be 4 inches in

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.760 
same and our sides will be 4 inches in
the<00:00:41.160> beginning<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.210> we'll<00:00:42.329> cut<00:00:42.570> off<00:00:42.770> 0.5

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the beginning and then we'll cut off 0.5

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
the beginning and then we'll cut off 0.5
centimeters<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.489> each<00:00:44.640> end<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.629> 3

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
centimeters on each end to have 3

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.639 
centimeters on each end to have 3
centimeters<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.879> edges<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> each<00:00:49.199> angle

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
centimeters on the edges and each angle

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.400 
centimeters on the edges and each angle
is<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:49.949> be<00:00:50.039> 60<00:00:50.370> degrees<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.079> this

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
is going to be 60 degrees to make this

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.660 
is going to be 60 degrees to make this
we<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.399> start<00:00:53.730> off<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> base<00:00:54.420> angle<00:00:54.989> of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:08.130 

two<00:00:59.670> centimeters

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.639 

let's<00:01:09.140> make<00:01:09.289> that<00:01:09.439> four<00:01:09.740> centimeters<00:01:10.990> one<00:01:11.990> two

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
let's make that four centimeters one two

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.340 
let's make that four centimeters one two
three<00:01:14.770> four

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
three four

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.340 
three four
well<00:01:18.350> then<00:01:18.469> use<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:18.859> protractor<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.780> do<00:01:20.959> 60

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
well then use the protractor to do 60

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.929 
well then use the protractor to do 60
degree<00:01:21.649> angles<00:01:22.100> off<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:23.240> endpoints<00:01:27.939> 60

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
degree angles off the endpoints 60

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:41.810 
degree angles off the endpoints 60
degrees

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:55.250 

sixty<00:01:42.820> degrees<00:01:43.090> from<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> other<00:01:43.450> end<00:01:43.630> point

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.679 

there

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.050 

and<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.130> confirm<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.880> measure

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and then just to confirm we can measure

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.830 
and then just to confirm we can measure
each<00:02:06.420> side<00:02:06.780> making<00:02:07.319> sure<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.840> four

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
each side making sure that it is four

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.229 
each side making sure that it is four
centimeters<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:12.019> four<00:02:13.019> centimeters<00:02:14.239> next

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
centimeters and four centimeters next

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.710 
centimeters and four centimeters next
we'll<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.569> 0.5<00:02:17.000> centimeter<00:02:19.220> knock<00:02:20.220> off

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
we'll do the 0.5 centimeter knock off

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.070 
we'll do the 0.5 centimeter knock off
cutoff<00:02:21.720> portion<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:24.180> cut<00:02:24.390> off<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.660> portion

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
cutoff portion we cut off this portion

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.589 
cutoff portion we cut off this portion
so<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.349> there's<00:02:25.799> about<00:02:26.549> extra<00:02:26.970> material

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
so that there's about extra material

00:02:27.599 --> 00:03:02.100 
so that there's about extra material
inside<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> foot<00:02:28.769> bag

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:12.940 

and<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.470> lines

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.650 

well<00:03:13.490> we<00:03:13.580> can<00:03:13.730> tell<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.060> one<00:03:14.240> looks<00:03:14.420> off<00:03:14.630> a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
well we can tell this one looks off a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:29.430 
well we can tell this one looks off a
little<00:03:15.020> bit<00:03:15.140> let<00:03:15.319> me<00:03:15.410> go<00:03:15.530> ahead<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.770> remeasure

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.010 

this<00:03:30.070> is<00:03:30.250> where<00:03:30.400> we'll<00:03:30.580> cut<00:03:30.820> him<00:03:30.940> off<00:03:31.090> now

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
this is where we'll cut him off now

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.750 
this is where we'll cut him off now
let's<00:03:32.230> go<00:03:32.350> ahead<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.770> make<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.160> regular

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
let's go ahead and make the regular

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.400 
let's go ahead and make the regular
Pentagon's<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:37.000> Pentagon's<00:03:37.570> are<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.140> five

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
Pentagon's the Pentagon's are is a five

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.800 
Pentagon's the Pentagon's are is a five
sided<00:03:38.650> object<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.910> total<00:03:40.240> degrees<00:03:40.570> of<00:03:40.600> the

sided object the total degrees of the
five<00:03:40.990> sided<00:03:41.290> object<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.790> 540<00:03:42.790> we'll<00:03:43.330> divide

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
five sided object is 540 we'll divide

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.020 
five sided object is 540 we'll divide
that<00:03:43.960> by<00:03:44.290> five<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:45.340> get<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.520> hundred<00:03:45.760> eighty

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
that by five to get a hundred eighty

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.180 
that by five to get a hundred eighty
degrees<00:03:46.450> for<00:03:46.720> each<00:03:46.840> angle<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.680> then<00:03:48.070> we'll

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
degrees for each angle and then we'll

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.510 
degrees for each angle and then we'll
have<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> two<00:03:48.700> centimeter<00:03:49.260> edge<00:03:50.260> for<00:03:51.130> each<00:03:51.190> side

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
have a two centimeter edge for each side

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.580 
have a two centimeter edge for each side
so<00:03:52.390> all<00:03:52.630> we<00:03:52.720> have<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.930> do<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.140> start<00:03:53.320> off<00:03:53.380> with

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
so all we have to do is start off with

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:13.949 
so all we have to do is start off with
our<00:03:53.710> two<00:03:53.920> centimeters<00:04:00.540> measure<00:04:01.540> 108<00:04:02.170> degrees

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.070 

and<00:05:50.199> let's<00:05:50.379> just<00:05:50.469> confirm<00:05:51.180> that<00:05:52.180> each<00:05:52.509> side<00:05:52.839> is

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
and let's just confirm that each side is

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:04.529 
and let's just confirm that each side is
two<00:05:53.949> signatures<00:05:55.860> -<00:05:59.069> two<00:06:01.830> -<00:06:02.830> yes<00:06:03.369> so<00:06:04.210> everything

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
two signatures - two - yes so everything

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.670 
two signatures - two - yes so everything
looks<00:06:04.689> good<00:06:04.960> this<00:06:05.680> is<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:05.949> construction<00:06:06.580> of

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
looks good this is the construction of

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.249 
looks good this is the construction of
the<00:06:08.680> Pentagon's<00:06:09.249> and<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:10.119> triangles<00:06:10.719> will

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
the Pentagon's and the triangles will

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.219 
the Pentagon's and the triangles will
need<00:06:11.409> 20<00:06:11.860> regular<00:06:12.399> triangles<00:06:13.119> with<00:06:13.749> the<00:06:13.899> edges

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
need 20 regular triangles with the edges

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.360 
need 20 regular triangles with the edges
cut<00:06:14.439> off<00:06:14.559> and<00:06:14.800> 12<00:06:15.520> regular<00:06:15.759> Pentagon's
