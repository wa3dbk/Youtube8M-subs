 each one you follow can end 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.130
 being a nuisance 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.280
 truck series comes to be the application 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.530
 almost perfect for us with this 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.479
 application for windows 8 we can 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.820
 connect to a database of 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.460
 practically all series of 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.340
 existing television see information from 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.380
 each chapter a summary and mark which 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.770
 It has been the last episode we have 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.770
 viewed 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.850
 we can also add how many series 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.160
 we want to see when it emits in the next 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.400
 chapter and even receive a 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.280
 notification of it the interface of 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.770
 tracks series for windows 8 is very very 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.370
 good also the content is super 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.290
 complete but as always there is a but 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.320
 is in English and the information of the 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.740
 episodes and their broadcast days are for 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.290
 the versions of the US chains do not 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.020
 But at least it tells us that one day 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.320
 or two after will be issued in our 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.320
 country 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.870
 every week we show you some of the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.909
 best games that we can find by 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.999
 the moment in the app store 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.310
 of windows 8 in it are the 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:46.340
 proposals that serve both for pc or 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.010
 laptop is like for tablet well 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.139
 this week we are possibly talking about 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.230
 one of the best games for tablets 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:57.019
 windows 8 and windows nt 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.599
 it's called impact and it's one of the few 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.249
 projects that I have seen at the moment 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.739
 designed to take advantage of the interface 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:06.340
 a touch screen in this system 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.340
 operative 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.750
 the simple but the concept of chimpa us 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.870
 has loved at the graphics level is 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.050
 great carefree very colorful with a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.209
 fantastic setting in addition in what 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.190
 a game mechanics is only concerned 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.410
 needed a finger on the mouse to 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.660
 play it 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.270
 starting from the trigger system of 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.610
 angry birds where we think a kind 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.980
 of invisible slingshot we will throw at 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.440
 chimpanzee protagonist with an angle and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.690
 concrete power to go 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.280
 advancing the map and picking 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.069
 bananas diamonds and other objects 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.470
 the goal is to finish each level what 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.390
 as soon as possible with the least number of 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.810
 releases and the greatest number of 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.740
 collected objects easy dynamic and worthy 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.740
 from a tablet 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.950
 I have not been going to class for some time 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.830
 I remember that the organization of classes 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.950
 classroom studies and other tasks was for 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.530
 me a real chaos I guess today in 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.170
 day will be similar only now we have 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.000
 at our disposal tools like 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.160
 the smartphones or the tablets that we 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.990
 allow to carry in a more comfortable way 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.840
 neat and readable 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.480
 these planning 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.550
 Well, if you have a windows tablet 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.400
 8 or even on the home computer 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.100
 you can download study planner and 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.070
 organize all your classes dvds exams 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.880
 and other aspects of your day to day in the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.860
 Institute or university easily study 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.199
 planner is as its name suggests a 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.139
 study planner with a style 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.120
 metro where we can enter 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.639
 our weekly classes the teacher of 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.030
 each one the schedules of each subject 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.650
 also entering each subject 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.860
 We can include the duties we have 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.360
 for the next week or class 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.720
 appearing later all the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.820
 entered in order of time 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.680
 let's see we already know that this kind of 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.290
 applications in require of a use 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.390
 constant so as not to be obsolete but 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.850
 is a tool that is there and that 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.320
 can give your tablet windows 8 a 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.320
 reason more than its existence 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.120
 and we ended up in the section on windows 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.120
 8 this week with a game like that 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.740
 Once you know who you come from xbox line 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.740
 it's called and I dominate it 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.750
 this puzzle game has turned out to be 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.729
 for me an incredible title after 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.620
 that did not give a euro to be able to see the 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.500
 captures offered by the creative studio 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.900
 in the app store 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.539
 but good illuminated is the name of a 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.569
 puzzle game that especially highlights 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:10.210
 by two sections its spectacular and 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.220
 artistic graphic section plus a 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.650
 huge expertise when it comes to creating 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.270
 labyrinths and challenges like few games 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.270
 before they have shown us 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.720
 and emilio are two friends that before 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.240
 they were to hang out and now 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.550
 they see less and less the reason 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.130
 metaphorical is that to be face to face 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.950
 you have to work hard every day 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.660
 overcome obstacles obstacles these 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.660
 obstacles are the puzzles that 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.930
 we will find in each compound level 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.990
 by a kind of labyrinth in each 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.310
 level we control the two characters 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.680
 simultaneously and the goal is 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.620
 put them together we will have to use the 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.870
 imagination move us with intelligence and 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.630
 the same requires concentration and 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.270
 attention what perhaps makes it a 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.870
 game as addictive and entertaining as 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.870
 magical 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.199
