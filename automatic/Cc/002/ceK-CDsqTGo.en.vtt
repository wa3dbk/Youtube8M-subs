00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.310
 the best goalkeepers to the son than the goalkeeper 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.690

 53 henninga 2 kinga thong and 10 9 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 positions and by the way this is one of the most 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.780
 old cards him as you can 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.750
 see 45 years old imagine 45 years old 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.270
 standing on the gate is something incredible 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.460
 well, it's all on the central position 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 defender we will have multiple 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.969
 central defense with a rating of 46 you 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.430
 imagine really ranking on 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.300
 really existed and honest 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.670
 look at his stats then he has 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 protection 47 some attackers even 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.600
 better protection 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 she is on position 2 defender and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.070
 still put de havilland with him 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.220
 protection in general 42 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.580
 how can I defend myself with such protection 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.619
 don't really understand me 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.350
 okay on the position right back and we 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.960
 put not the smallest rbk fur 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.100
 the hall on it will stand mansur him 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 27 blow and 44 defenses 31 more postings 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.079
 the shaft is just awful 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.840
 will deal it's just one of 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.770
 the most terrible wreaths in the loft position 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 Bek we will stand 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.880
 politics a second here he is 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.920
 loaded in position on the run we 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.340
 will stand about hanwon 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.679
 the man who plays in the Bulgar canton 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 yes all the same he is 96 years old and that gives him 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.289
 chance of development but now his card 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.179
 just something incredibly awful 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.170
 so you go our team my friend on 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.140
 love me do positions 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.450
 we first Pole in the team at 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.950
 I think the only Pole Pole under 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.079
 the name pi reflects la and he generally 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.349
 terrible stats and his card 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.870
 he has a rating of 4040 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.019
 this is one of the worst fifa cards 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.250
 ultimate team that ever was 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.060
 she is in position cm and we still put 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.060
 still in my 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.209
 one unknown Arabs or Austrians 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.799
 Yes, we still put the Austrians Mayer 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.140
 46 speed 45 hryvnia 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.829
 thirty two blows 32 defense 42 by 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.440
 blue 47 physicists of God is terrible 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:44.230
 the card is just incredibly awful 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.810
 we will have cards on the cdma position 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.530
 we will be on cdma damn position right away it 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.120
 did not work on the cd position - there will be a player 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.859
 43 rated out of 32 protection 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.090
 how can you be a sedan with such 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:06.319
 circumstances, I do not know it at the position of a cm 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.590
 we will put another player in my 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.290
 he is also Irish I don't remember no this 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.019
 Maltese and he also turns out to be the most 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.170
 worst rating ever he had 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.239
 rating is also 40 and it's fair to say 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.609
 The most terrible food card 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.019
 can see 38 speeds 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:30.319
 44 dribbling 36 strikes 31 defense 33 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.450
 physics and 42 posting as they do 40 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.680
 have given 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.209
 I don't know how it happened at all 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.610
 let's go to our paradise book 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.440
 before us they will stand with glory 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.160
 god there is no so terrible game to 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.209
 members cue he has a rating of 48 and in my opinion 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.849
 this is the best card that is in the 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.360
 our composition well, except for breathing Windows either 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:58.180
 explain all of them he has 48 protection too 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.769
 Lana and the last and bright will be our 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.450
 a striker who was worth less than 10 pieces 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.450
 ten freaking pieces didn't cost the most 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:14.680
 the best striker in the world and his last name 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.540
 leg well that's the worst team in 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.070
 world gentlemen 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.200
 gameplay I won't do it because 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.859
 I have already made it impossible 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.859
 competition 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.210
 and at 0 chemistry and I think that the result 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.229
 honestly say it will not be better if I 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.139
 I will do it again I really and that 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.949
 did you now see the best 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.979
 team world and to be honest with you was 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.470
 fountain with it was a warehouse builder on the very 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.509
 the worst team in the world subscribe 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.070
 put huskies and remember that this is me 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.070
