 they were suspended and stood 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.009
 that's what the southern minister announced 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.929
 African mineral resources the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.930
 Central African Republic failed to fulfill the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.609
 kimberley process requirements the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.529
 decision was taken at the end of four 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 meeting days in south africa 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.480
 last week this is a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.910
 certification system that allows 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 control the traceability of diamonds and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.399
 prevent him from financing conflicts 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
 armed 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.219
 set up in 2003 the process of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.640
 kimberley count in november 2012 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 almost 80 countries to be admitted the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.629
 States are required to put in place 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 legislative provisions and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 export controls at 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.590
 import and internal trade 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.590
 diamonds these are these controls that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.000
 would fail in the country of the Central African Republic 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.309
 since the coup d'Ã©tat of the coalition 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 rebellious is the case last March these 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.260
 controls would have almost disappeared 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.479
 the transition president michel djoko 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.390
 dia had tried to give 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.890
 pledges by announcing a moratorium on 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.530
 rotations and the sale of diamonds 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 a few days before the meeting he had 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 declared wanting to put in place 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.100
 measures to moralize the sector a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.259
 centralized diamond purse should 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.840
 be created the cash transactions 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.780
 will be banned and controls 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.579
 strengthened it nevertheless seems that this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.460
 announcement is not convinced the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.380
 responsible for the regulatory system 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.450
 consequence the Central African Republic must do 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 faced with an embargo on the export of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 these diamonds 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 a blow to this country where the industry 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.549
 precious stone makes live more 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.229
 900,000 fellow citizens 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.990
 it's almost a fifth of the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.030
 Central African population is one of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.450
 five largest global producers of 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450
 diamond 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.259
 the Senegalese general babacar gaye was 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.180
 appointed at the head of the UN mission 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.340
 in the Central African Republic this

 five years the blue helmets in republic 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.130
 democratic of the congo 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.050
 always concerning the Central African Republic the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.610
 Central African Prime Minister Nicolas 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.069
 from shanghai formed a new 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.110
