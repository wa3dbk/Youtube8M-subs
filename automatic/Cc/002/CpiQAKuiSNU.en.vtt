00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.759 

flying<00:02:17.819> saucers<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.019> he<00:02:19.110> gets<00:02:19.290> away<00:02:19.409> from<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
flying saucers and he gets away from the

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.440 
flying saucers and he gets away from the
ground<00:02:20.010> effects<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.580> flies<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.849> lot<00:02:21.090> better
