00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.549
 saleh well we are women for peace for this new tutorial 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.190
 video that dedicated to creating custom ringtones this 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.409
 feeling was that his iphone 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.619
 so for that we do not have a small software promises on the computer 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.989
 it's called a war no longer ir i mg pr 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.349
 alleluia 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.510
 we will make sure the first link this meal and meet point net 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.380
 at the bottom of the page we have a category of aude 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.890
 we take the executable 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 we record 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.210
 that's a word that were loaded with prime oil 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.050
 and when we run executable 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.960
 we find ourselves on this interface 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.910
 that will allow me to actually create the room 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.750
 from an mp3 file that we have on his computer 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.160
 so we're carrying 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.980
 we will search 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.470
 his oil 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.470
 so to answer these to try 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.720
 here 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.370
 but we are saved 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.540
 so we let work a little bit 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.660
 and there we can choose 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.330
 the duration 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.630
 so 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.270
 a second 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 Indian oil demand 10 seconds maximum 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.270
 and we will be able to choose also 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 that's how 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.440
 at what time the song for their ranking express france des calanques 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.000
 in fact 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.450
 so I want to start for example here and there 47th seoul 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.170
 but after that it is true that to begin 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.740
 it's beautiful hermant am happy with my fate and I proved when 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.540
 I wanted to put it 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 so he had on the export 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.079
 I know export all the kiosks 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.749
 and that I made big 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.509
 she had access to masonry directly 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.509
 alain the ringtone was created 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.349
 I then in the kiosks 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.389
 morris dances 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.389
 and we find it here duration 30 seconds 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.609
 so if 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.169
 the menu is dying he is not very proud 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.029
 so we're going to edit preference 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
