00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:11.160
 The smartphone which is a window suma was announced from the mouse computer 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.030
 This is a windows phone, but details such as the price have not been announced yet 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 But 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:25.780
 The use of the terminal is such a feeling that Windows Phone has developed so so is msm 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:32.110
 8916 area of I So memory first gas is up Dragon 410 storage's different 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.950
 Sd memory card with the 16 gb But I'm wondering memory slot I 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.890
 I want to 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:41.530
 This is also possible because there is not enough space for recovery sd card 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.770
 Maybe kind of pattern that say therefore are against 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.980
 After all internal storage 8 gb it 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.160
 What's not it h Prize about 5 inches 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.390
 Who's h and ips lcd 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.880
 It is the corresponding network 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:05.780
 Easy is Band 189 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.700
 I don't know what this coolness is, but og corresponds to band 139 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.450
 It is called 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.649
 Well that's basically it 's basically assuming nowhere, but that alone 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.500
 It is not 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:25.750
 Band 8 Now it's a softbank platinum band, isn't it? 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:33.610
 So this is clearly a specification that also looks to Softbank 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:36.130
 So maybe DoCoMo's team and I wonder if not it can use normally be Softbank of competent 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.880
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.780
 I'm substituting and there is also bluetooth 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.480
 And it's 4 ceilings 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.690
 Camera 8 million and 200 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:53.490
 Well, it's normal but not high performance though 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:02:01.980
 I perfectly I sensor example also of the minimum necessary things are equipped in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:05.500
 Construction light acceleration electronic compass gps and a gps yo corresponding to liquid crystal nearly c 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.210
 I have a ridge, I wrote that the main body is pasted 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.480
 Thought 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.550
 That's right 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:17.400
 I wonder if such that the liquid crystal surface wonder if there is wanna flight this is the fact that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 I do not know well but let's check the appearance 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.330
 It has always been this way 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.500
 This is a speaker 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.020
 Camera and led 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.090
 google led 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:35.530
 So it's usually a speaker for the camera in front too 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.310
 Although it has a button but it is a physical touch sensor 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.270
 The 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.270
 It becomes like this 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.980
 Range yes yes yes 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.250
 Well quite 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.460
 I mean 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.600
 It looks like a cost down feeling 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.020
 There is no special feature 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.970
 Summary 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:10.850
 The spec is minimal, so this time the mouse is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.310
 The intention is that the product is planned with priority given to price impact. 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.150
 a 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.050
 It will be most anxious whether it becomes the price general to that much 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.130
 By the way 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:26.490
 Goo 01 I What is this 10,000 yen in Tampa 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.640
 I wonder if the terminal is 8 and that looks at the spec 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.660
 It's very similar, you're right 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:39.060
 I feel like it's better to be here 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:43.260
 I wonder if you are aiming to cut 10,000 yen 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.480
 In I'm resulting in little expectation of Ne Ja do possible if the mouse's 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.110
 But if you think about reality it will be quite tough 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:56.780
 Why is it that also with a protection sheet 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:03.410
 The sd card will also follow , including the saas in a 10,000 yen machine 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:09.860
 It will actually feel like it would be around 15,000 yen or something 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.100
 However, it is not a single item, but somehow we hand in hand with some mvno seam companies 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.780
 If it is a plan and a set 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:23.700
 If the terminal will be significantly cheaper or lipid 0 yen or such measures may be done 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:31.120
 There is a terminal that is well-suited to the domestic radio wave conditions with windows phone 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:34.860
 Great Nde that would be Oh yeah hottest If Dasa disadvantageous if 15,000 yen 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.860
 You will then want Check it out
