00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
kind of habit after every smoke of using

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.980 
kind of habit after every smoke of using
your<00:00:19.980> traditional<00:00:20.400> cotton<00:00:21.210> pipe<00:00:21.420> cleaner<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
your traditional cotton pipe cleaner and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
your traditional cotton pipe cleaner and
basically<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.890> pipe<00:00:23.490> cleaner<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.880> designed

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
basically this pipe cleaner is designed

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.080 
basically this pipe cleaner is designed
just<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.630> pick<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> excess<00:00:25.529> moisture<00:00:26.090> in

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
just to pick up the excess moisture in

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.650 
just to pick up the excess moisture in
the<00:00:27.500> shank<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> skim<00:00:29.359> moisture<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the shank and in the skim moisture that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.900 
the shank and in the skim moisture that
the<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.080> briar<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.800> captured<00:00:32.130> so

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the the briar is not captured so

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
the the briar is not captured so
basically<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> habit<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
basically if I get the habit of a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.940 
basically if I get the habit of a
running<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> pipe<00:00:36.660> cleaner<00:00:37.020> through<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
running of a pipe cleaner through it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.180 
running of a pipe cleaner through it
after<00:00:38.100> every<00:00:38.550> smoke<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> line<00:00:40.190> even

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
after every smoke now down the line even

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.040 
after every smoke now down the line even
a<00:00:41.280> fine<00:00:41.520> pipe<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> fighting<00:00:42.300> tobacco<00:00:42.570> control

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
a fine pipe and fighting tobacco control

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
a fine pipe and fighting tobacco control
a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.260> sour<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.550> basically<00:00:45.059> what

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
a little sour on you and basically what

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
a little sour on you and basically what
happens<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.559> guitar<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.039> built<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
happens is the guitar is built up in the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549 
happens is the guitar is built up in the
shank<00:00:47.969> area<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> give<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
shank area and you have to give it a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
shank area and you have to give it a
more<00:00:49.739> thorough<00:00:50.070> cleaning<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:51.420> likely<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
more thorough cleaning pretty likely and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
more thorough cleaning pretty likely and
that's<00:00:52.469> where<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.820> bristle

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that's where you use the the bristle

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.840 
that's where you use the the bristle
pipe<00:00:54.960> cleaner<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> rough<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.489> use<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
pipe cleaner the rough and I use the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
pipe cleaner the rough and I use the
analogy<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.600> boar<00:00:57.840> bristle<00:00:57.870> brush<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
analogy of a boar bristle brush for a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.250 
analogy of a boar bristle brush for a
rifle<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.219> shotgun<00:00:59.449> where<00:01:00.449> you're<00:01:00.690> taking<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
rifle or shotgun where you're taking the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.520 
rifle or shotgun where you're taking the
the<00:01:01.500> bristle<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.399> dipping<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
the bristle you're dipping it in the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.410 
the bristle you're dipping it in the
pipe<00:01:04.530> cleaning<00:01:05.369> fluid<00:01:05.700> which<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.000> basically

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pipe cleaning fluid which is basically

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.929 
pipe cleaning fluid which is basically
an<00:01:07.229> alcohol<00:01:07.740> base<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> little<00:01:08.520> sweetener

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
an alcohol base with a little sweetener

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
an alcohol base with a little sweetener
dipping<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> first<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> take<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.799> stem

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
dipping it the first you take your stem

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100 
dipping it the first you take your stem
off<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.520> basically<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.869> your

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
off and basically you're like with your

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.020 
off and basically you're like with your
rifle<00:01:13.530> bore<00:01:13.920> you're<00:01:14.130> doing<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> scrubbing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
rifle bore you're doing the scrubbing

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.100 
rifle bore you're doing the scrubbing
and<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.140> picks<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> tars<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.960> dip<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and that picks up the tars how I dip the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.950 
and that picks up the tars how I dip the
other<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.880> real<00:01:21.330> cheap<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
other in I do it I'm real cheap with the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.580 
other in I do it I'm real cheap with the
pipe<00:01:22.140> cleaner

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
pipe cleaner

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
pipe cleaner
so<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.280> I'll<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.720> I'll<00:01:24.720> fold<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.259> half

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
so what I'll do is I'll fold it in half

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
so what I'll do is I'll fold it in half
because<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.890> middle<00:01:26.100> part<00:01:26.340> still<00:01:26.670> clean

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because your middle part still clean

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.539 
because your middle part still clean
work<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.770> might<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.070> through<00:01:29.280> two

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
work that in you might go through two

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
work that in you might go through two
three<00:01:29.759> even<00:01:30.090> four<00:01:30.119> cleaners<00:01:30.780> okay<00:01:31.229> where<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
three even four cleaners okay where it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.999 
three even four cleaners okay where it
comes<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.920> relatively<00:01:32.460> clean<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.829> pipe

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
comes up relatively clean and the pipe

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
comes up relatively clean and the pipe
smoking<00:01:35.759> well<00:01:36.030> again<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.689> sounds<00:01:36.900> good

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
smoking well again it sounds good

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.440 
smoking well again it sounds good
and<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.430> got<00:01:38.610> done<00:01:38.939> smoking<00:01:39.299> my
