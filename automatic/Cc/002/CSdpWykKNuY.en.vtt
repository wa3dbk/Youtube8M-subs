00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.769
 hi to all and balsan case i hope that 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.129
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.509
 nickel 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.769
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.999
 new glitch that will allow you to 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.590
 to enter any vehicle in 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.880
 your garage so I had you 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.949
 proposed a few days ago it was necessary 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.449
 that you are three there you will not have 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.740
 need only one mate in there is 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.570
 sure to help you so what's going to be 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.769
 a little more practical there I'm going to you 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.420
 show that this vehicle could not 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.679
 to have entered my garage so there you 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.419
 go put it like me in the video 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.740
 you can leave the door open 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.590
 story that it's a little easier 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.550
 for the rest so there then once 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.930
 that he's placed like that you're going 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.949
 go into your garage on foot has 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.820
 then once you arrive in 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.649
 your garage you're going to have to 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.239
 select a vehicle that you go 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.530
 lose afterwards so take the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.980
 the purest vehicle and you can 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.809
 take 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.480
 I do not have much choice so I have 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.960
 take a dader duplication have it 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.430
 mounted in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.750
 once you will be in your 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.300
 car you're going to have to press the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.559
 r2 key to get out of the garage and quickly 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.579
 change character so just to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.500
 give a little something like this 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.540
 here and if it worked you go 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.560
 able to roll in your garage so there 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.890
 you want me to ride in my 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.689
 garage 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.340
 so it's really the hardest thing in the 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.909
 manip you're going to press the key 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.360
 start 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.460

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.750

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.729

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.579

 so there we arrive in the welcome you 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.600
 have to have fun leaving the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.040
 as quickly as possible so there you 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.330
 see I have left you 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.439
 arrive on a load that is rather 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.890
 long so I'm going to go beyond that 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:02.180
 accelerated and after this loading you 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 go see that I will repair in the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.270
 life of my garage so there will have to be that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.320
 you ran as fast as possible 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.909
 to get into the vehicle of your 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.720
 mate 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.280
 So here you go in the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.989
 vehicle there you will have to wait 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.090
 which is the little cinematic that bug 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.260
 so there you do not move and especially not there 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.519
 there is the little cinematic you see 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.840
 that the vehicle has just disappeared 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.880
 so there you have more than to go out 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.170
 from the garage on foot came in and there 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.370
 you will see that you have been able to enter the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.260
 your friend's vehicle in your garage 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.610
 hawks that is really convenient for them 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.480
 people who start the game or so 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.040
 those who have no money for 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 to be able to make some money in 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.459
 unlimited 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.470
 and so that's my buddy's vehicle 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.220
 that in the beginning of the video I could not 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.170
 put my garage 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.330

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.650
 liter worked well me I you 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.599
