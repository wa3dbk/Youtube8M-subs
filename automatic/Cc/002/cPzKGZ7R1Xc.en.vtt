like I think it was like five games out
of<00:02:51.209> like<00:02:51.540> 20<00:02:51.810> probably<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.800> hitting<00:02:53.130> from

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

of like 20 probably for hitting from
behind<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.110> sucks<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.010> it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
