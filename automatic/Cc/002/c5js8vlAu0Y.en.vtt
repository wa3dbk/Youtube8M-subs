00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.090
 Welcome to my workshop there. 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.860
 Have you ever made Italian slash? 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.559
 some doubt as to how it mainly 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.089
 using the sewing machine then the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.839
 Today's video will clarify your 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.570
 doubts 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.300
 Let's go watch the video today. 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.000
 we will need the following material to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.699
 cause we're going to make the bar 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.900
 another pair of pants for us to take measurements 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.660
 is had the color line of the pants or more 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.829
 Approximate you have zone 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.170
 precision iron scissors 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.170
 I'm going to use this one this time it's a good one. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.050
 seam mark and if you have it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.289
 best is a ironing board 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 Let's begin to make our cause the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.940
 our cause 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 We will win the cause and you will 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.100
 pick up this part and fold it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.379
 just as we touch the social cause 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.629
 right 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.189
 so the two front pockets of 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 Work will look golden this way. 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.840
 You'll put her on the ironing board. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.650
 pass so she also had on 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.619
 Ironing board is straightened 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 iron and you will pass your house passes 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.280
 It's bad as if it were to be used 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 especially here from half a stone 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.990
 forth here only gives greater for fechadinha 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.280
 she play we will pass the pants 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.280
 as if you were going to use it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.659
 will be a good as her courage to catch 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:52.469
 best olympic and leaves well rating well 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.539
 flat on the right ironing board 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.740
 done that we'll get the other cause 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.720
 that will serve as measure 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.390
 then you are already looks just pass it 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.979
 it was good here on the board 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.780
 We 'll get the pants that will fit 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.880
 for us as a measure that is already 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.229
 folded just like you already did 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.140
 took a break to stay more 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.319
 Stretched too and we 'll put it by 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.840
 top of the other and we'll watch and we 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.180
 Let's put shore with coast occur 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.489
 this part where the belt is going will not go 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.079
 put on the waistcoat and you will see 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.319
 yes she is very right 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:31.739
 here you will analyze well the pants stay 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.890
 well stretched because we want it 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.510
 She really is cuddled in size, right? 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.239
 another cause that it is as a measure 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.890
 also right then we pull 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.720
 here a little bit for her to come on your 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.239
 house is so close to the iron 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.489
 I'm going to take that first one of you. 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.709
 see well, how do I do? 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.709
 So here you go, I'm not going to 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.250
 She's the one in here, I'm leaving. 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.819
 two little fingers and I'll fold my pants 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.819
 planet 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.739
 after you're turned she'll see if 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.290
 she 's very straight here she is not 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.080
 with one side larger than the other 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.420
 by doing this you can adjust here and see if 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.980
 You're crazy, baby. 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.430
 I'm going to make a mistake of the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:23.230
 one more pull on it also the two 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.420
 here you have to see if they are 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.640
 same said straight 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.780
 so I like a certain well straight to 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.150
 two digits 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.160
 was not what I wanted okay that I 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.340
 I'll do it, I'll go get the iron. 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.769
 I came here the steam faith not you 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:54.450
 have steam help to play more 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:54.450
 quick and I'm done right 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.310
 now that I'm going to do I 've seen that she is 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.989
 to be in danger of doubling because the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.409
 of these causes are usually well 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.310
 I'll get a line and a 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:11.430
 needle is from a proposal the strong nor 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.959
 here may be white it may be red 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.570
 Orange anything else not 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.430
 Be the color of your pants and you will do 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.570
 points to align to give a 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.570
 insured in this case 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.000
 here you do not need capri is just for 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.530
 learn even that you will do in the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.020
 two legs, it's okay 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.340
 now that we've done it 's the line 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.080
 Plans and boys in the two are feathers we 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.729
 let's put the machine to the sewing machine 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.060
 what are we going to do we will become 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.449
 from the wrong side and we are going to 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.910
 pants bar on the machine I always 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.220
 I usually take this part here because 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.530
 Well, I'm not good, I'm fine. I'll go by 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.690
 Thesis machine here in the edge is fine. 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.789
 because here is the end of the bar 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.220
 here would be and I'll sew all around 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:11.409
 Stretching well to send Let's go then 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:13.330
 Sew all the way back to the seam, you see. 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.760
 She is already here so she will not 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.530
 back foot over it you will do 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.960
 on both legs are 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.270
 after sewing this and a little 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.280
 Chubby machine, we're going back to 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.139
 ironing board so now we already 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.120
 You've passed that posture right here. 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.580
 learn to bar that first battle 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.470
 people did on both legs 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.560
 What we're going to do, we had 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.630
 left two fingers bigger nÃ© to us 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.370
 can also come by donating these 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.389
 two of them exactly what we are going to 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:48.039
 turn it over here it will also cover 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:52.449
 this seam that we will turn to 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:57.250
 right bar and let's hit it right 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:06:01.479
 so she is not to be pie right 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.370
 and let's do it on both legs being 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.669
 This one I will already come I have already passed with faith 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:14.300

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:17.270
 also look a little, it's not right 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.250
 nor if you pull because we went and 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.620
 stirring it goes out of the right place 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:34.760
