00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.340
 good friends greetings 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.430
 I am mega fitch is colombia my name is 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.750
 carlos jurado creator of sales from 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:18.099
 approximately 5 years founder of 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.099
 group people beta colombia 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.380
 this is an initiative that we are 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.740
 starting with the administrative staff of 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.170
 beta people colombia to make a series 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.430
 of explanatory videos in everything that 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 has to do about the beta not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.770
 in this video it is specially oriented 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 for the newbies for the people who 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.120
 they are starting in this wonderful 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.890
 then betta fish world 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.590
 considering that many people 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.570
 they ask in the group and ask about 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.460
 inbox what are the differences between 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.670
 the betas that ask what kind of 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.980
 betas this what kind of sales that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.399
 then the need arises to do 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.620
 this video to teach the newbies 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.220
 to the new ones what are the differences 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.369
 Regarding the type of fins and colors 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.729
 today we are going to talk about the fins maybe 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.220
 do not have all the variety in my farm 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.690
 of existing fins but let's talk 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.620
 a little of the most common 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.990
 speaking from the beginning the kind of 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.940
 most common fin we have 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.940
 well that we know everywhere 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.360
 beta splenda veil tail 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.970
 the tail of veil belta he is the species 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.890
 most common that we find in any 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.040
 fish store or that we found in 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.330
 any side 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.120
 unfortunately I do not have in my 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.760
 hatchery that kind of fin variation 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.360
 but main characteristics that its 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.700
 tail falls on point 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.540
 and then the most basic of all 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 betas but that's not why we're going to not 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.470
 admire it then we have to have in 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.180
 account that thanks to the veil tail is 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.289
 that we have all these types of varieties 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.930
 in our homes in our hatcheries 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.050
 after the tail of veil comes the beta 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.670
 delta has an opening 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.030
 not greater than 120 degrees 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.920
 It is a very nice fish and also 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.110
 we found it in stores in this 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.380
 I do not have it either 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.270
 and a little further on from that kind of 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.910
 fins we found the super delta 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.220
 that goes from the final delta range 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:45.180
 up to 179 degrees does not exceed 179 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.900
 degrees and here we have a copy 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.170
 and we have let's show it here we have 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.599
 a good this is another machito that 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.800
 we there ready to start 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.060
 fight with the other 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.060
 let's put it 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.800
 and here we have a beta delta 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.740
 This color is known as chocolate 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.220
 it is a color also very nice 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.580
 that is a delta remember you can not 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.470
 overcome the opening of 179 degrees because 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.780
 if it is already exceeded then we would be talking 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:28.010
 of a half moon or half moon 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.049
 the abbreviation is hm 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.569
 in Spanish because it is half moon and in 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:36.440
 English we are talking about common jade 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:40.210
 then this is one of a super delta 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.210
 so they know how it is 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.519
 they are also very cute they are not so 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.970
 commercial as people are 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.110
 totally in love with the crescent 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.160
 so 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.160
 there we can see it 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:02.030
 here we also have a ready 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:05.560
 half moon a half moon let's show it 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.550
 we take this out carefully 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.730
 let's see we will locate the crescent here 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.730
 is 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.299
 this is the most popular fish the fish 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.299
 cutest in terms of letters 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.400
 here is this color is a color that 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:35.100
 Cambodian flame let's give it a few 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:39.050
 seconds to try to recover 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.050
 the temperature change and all that 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.270
 there is 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.590
 and hey it's like tim I matter 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:57.120
 to go while counting the beta 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:59.690
 half moon at first was corrected 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.860
 in contests that made the 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.570
 international beta congresses not yet 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.930
 was cataloged at that time not what 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.570
 they wanted the judges did not like 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.910
 then most of all they chose delta 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.790
 yes 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.780
 and super deltas including the queue was 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.630
 the one who was leading at that time 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.330
 the first half competencies that data 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.110
 Well, the first one that was called a contest 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.810
 I will read 39 his way a very cute fish 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.249
 It was blue if I was not wrong it was a 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.720
 turquoise or a royal blue 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:36.310
 I do not remember very well 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.840
 it seems that it is already 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.200
 starting to 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.330
 to excite effectively 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.710
 sometimes you have to let them go you have to have 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.100
 be very careful when you loose two 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.840
 betas they attack us immediately 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.840
 immediately they never attack 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.810
 first they start a dance they threaten and 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.790
 because there if after a while they attack 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.470
 already with time one learns to know 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.560
 all types of movements that 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.560
 have then for sure we are going to 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.470
 introduce it to separate it because we already saw 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.900
 that blue is very aggressive 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.390
 so I wanted to show him that's the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.890
 Half moon there is opening 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.370
 It is already beginning to surround 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.900
 exactly there we can see that the 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.639
 caudal opening 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.639
 it is 180 degrees 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.120
 that is the half men ' 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.960
 here we can see suddenly a small 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.960
 Photography 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.760
 there is 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.250
 after the half moon 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.090
 other variations come out also very 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.010
 beautiful 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.680
 there is even one that exceeds 180 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.880
 degrees that call it over half moon 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.730
 let's see if we can see that kind of 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.110
 pc in this let's see if we see that in 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.030
 this fish that we are going to demonstrate in the 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.310
 moment 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.310
 this is a white halfon over 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.280
 let's see let's choose if here is 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.070
 and here is 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:20.320
 we hope that 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.320
 I started fighting immediately 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.270
 always the temperature varies a little 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.270
 from the bottle to the aquarium 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.350
 we'll see 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.970
 let's give it a time so that it 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.970
 Replace and already back
