wheels and benefit of having a really

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.130 
wheels and benefit of having a really

thank<00:00:24.950> you<00:00:25.040> Tim<00:00:25.220> this<00:00:25.940> wheel<00:00:26.210> is<00:00:26.330> probably<00:00:26.630> my

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
thank you Tim this wheel is probably my

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.660 
thank you Tim this wheel is probably my
favorite<00:00:27.290> bit<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:27.530> trike<00:00:27.800> it<00:00:28.070> because<00:00:28.520> they

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
favorite bit a trike it because they

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.950 
favorite bit a trike it because they
look<00:00:28.850> really<00:00:28.880> good<00:00:29.270> and<00:00:29.480> they<00:00:29.690> make<00:00:29.840> a<00:00:29.870> really

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
look really good and they make a really

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.260 
look really good and they make a really
nice<00:00:30.410> noise<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:30.980> want<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.550> talk<00:00:31.700> a<00:00:31.730> little<00:00:32.090> bit

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
nice noise I want to talk a little bit

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.450 
nice noise I want to talk a little bit
about<00:00:32.300> why<00:00:33.020> this<00:00:33.080> wheel<00:00:33.530> is<00:00:33.710> good<00:00:33.980> why<00:00:34.400> you

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
about why this wheel is good why you

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.190 
about why this wheel is good why you
should<00:00:34.670> think<00:00:34.820> about<00:00:34.970> using<00:00:35.270> one<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.780> maybe

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
should think about using one and maybe

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.780 
should think about using one and maybe
just<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:36.590> spell<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:36.920> couple<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.430> myths<00:00:37.610> about

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
just to spell a couple of myths about

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.330 
just to spell a couple of myths about
disc<00:00:38.180> wheels

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
disc wheels

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.640 
disc wheels
thank<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.270> one<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.140> things<00:00:42.350> that<00:00:42.500> goes

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
thank you so one of the things that goes

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.380 
thank you so one of the things that goes
around<00:00:42.800> about<00:00:43.070> disc<00:00:43.340> wheels<00:00:43.550> an<00:00:43.730> awful<00:00:44.030> lot<00:00:44.180> is

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
around about disc wheels an awful lot is

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.850 
around about disc wheels an awful lot is
that<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.570> have<00:00:44.809> to<00:00:44.960> hit<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.200> certain<00:00:45.500> speed

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
that you have to hit a certain speed

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.860 
that you have to hit a certain speed
before<00:00:46.130> it<00:00:46.370> starts<00:00:46.670> working<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.450> number

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
before it starts working and the number

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.570 
before it starts working and the number
I<00:00:47.900> hear<00:00:48.110> on<00:00:48.320> is<00:00:48.410> 40<00:00:48.710> kilometres<00:00:49.010> an<00:00:49.280> hour<00:00:49.400> is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
I hear on is 40 kilometres an hour is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.280 
I hear on is 40 kilometres an hour is
powerful<00:00:50.059> magic<00:00:50.090> speed<00:00:50.660> before<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:51.080> disc

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
powerful magic speed before a disc

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.220 
powerful magic speed before a disc
starts<00:00:51.530> working<00:00:52.010> absolutely<00:00:52.550> untrue<00:00:53.360> as<00:00:54.020> long

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
starts working absolutely untrue as long

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.990 
starts working absolutely untrue as long
as<00:00:54.320> you're<00:00:54.440> going<00:00:54.650> faster<00:00:55.040> than<00:00:55.100> about<00:00:55.309> 15<00:00:55.760> K

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
as you're going faster than about 15 K

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.270 
as you're going faster than about 15 K
now<00:00:56.240> this<00:00:56.630> is<00:00:56.840> working<00:00:57.230> for<00:00:57.470> you<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:58.070> reason

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
now this is working for you the reason

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.880 
now this is working for you the reason
that<00:00:58.490> it<00:00:58.700> works<00:00:58.910> two<00:00:59.690> ways<00:00:59.900> firstly<00:01:00.650> there's

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
that it works two ways firstly there's

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.560 
that it works two ways firstly there's
no<00:01:01.070> spokes<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.520> drag<00:01:01.760> through<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.120> air<00:01:02.239> so

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
no spokes to drag through the air so

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.229 
no spokes to drag through the air so
you've<00:01:02.750> got<00:01:02.960> lower<00:01:03.410> drag<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.190> secondly<00:01:04.820> most

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
you've got lower drag and secondly most

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.820 
you've got lower drag and secondly most
the<00:01:05.449> discs<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:05.900> use<00:01:06.080> now<00:01:06.229> have<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.470> little<00:01:06.650> bit

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
the discs we use now have a little bit

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.469 
the discs we use now have a little bit
of<00:01:06.860> an<00:01:07.009> ellipse<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.460> them<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:07.940> we<00:01:08.060> get<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> little

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
of an ellipse on them so we get a little

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.060 
of an ellipse on them so we get a little
bit<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.660> lift<00:01:08.780> off<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.140> disc<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.740> works<00:01:09.950> a

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
bit of lift off the disc so it works a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.440 
bit of lift off the disc so it works a
little<00:01:10.190> bit<00:01:10.369> like<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.610> wheel<00:01:10.820> on<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> aircraft

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
little bit like a wheel on the aircraft

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.990 
little bit like a wheel on the aircraft
so<00:01:12.020> it's<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.290> smoother<00:01:12.800> wheel<00:01:13.190> it<00:01:13.520> has<00:01:13.550> less

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
so it's a smoother wheel it has less

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.510 
so it's a smoother wheel it has less
drag<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:15.229> also<00:01:15.380> has<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.770> little<00:01:16.040> bit<00:01:16.160> of<00:01:16.280> what<00:01:16.399> we

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
drag it also has a little bit of what we

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.249 
drag it also has a little bit of what we
call<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.790> flywheel<00:01:17.240> effect<00:01:17.270> there's<00:01:18.110> a

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
call the flywheel effect there's a

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.630 
call the flywheel effect there's a
little<00:01:18.500> bit<00:01:18.649> more<00:01:18.680> weight<00:01:19.009> throughout<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
little bit more weight throughout the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.430 
little bit more weight throughout the
wheel<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:20.060> little<00:01:20.360> bit<00:01:20.450> more<00:01:20.600> inertia<00:01:21.080> and

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
wheel a little bit more inertia and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.620 
wheel a little bit more inertia and
momentum<00:01:21.649> in<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.220> wheel<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.030> once<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.420> get<00:01:23.600> a

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
momentum in this wheel so once you get a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.600 
momentum in this wheel so once you get a
wound<00:01:23.869> up<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.380> will<00:01:24.740> spin<00:01:25.009> out<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.190> keep<00:01:25.460> you

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
wound up it will spin out and keep you

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.539 
wound up it will spin out and keep you
rolling<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.119> rolling<00:01:26.149> in<00:01:26.509> right<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.310> disc

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
rolling and rolling in right so the disc

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.010 
rolling and rolling in right so the disc
will<00:01:28.729> give<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.030> little<00:01:29.270> bit<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.479> free<00:01:29.690> speed

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
will give you a little bit of free speed

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.289 
will give you a little bit of free speed
not<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.500> whole<00:01:30.710> lot<00:01:30.920> but<00:01:31.100> probably<00:01:31.940> somewhere

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
not a whole lot but probably somewhere

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.360 
not a whole lot but probably somewhere
in<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.450> vicinity<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:33.049> around<00:01:33.409> about<00:01:33.740> 20<00:01:34.100> or<00:01:34.190> 30

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
in the vicinity of around about 20 or 30

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.789 
in the vicinity of around about 20 or 30
seconds<00:01:34.820> over<00:01:35.090> other<00:01:35.240> wheels<00:01:35.510> at<00:01:36.409> around<00:01:36.680> the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
seconds over other wheels at around the

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.469 
seconds over other wheels at around the
40<00:01:37.040> kilometer<00:01:37.430> distance<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.299> it's

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
40 kilometer distance so it's

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.450 
40 kilometer distance so it's
significant<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:39.290> measurable<00:01:39.710> but<00:01:40.310> it's

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
significant and it's measurable but it's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.340 
significant and it's measurable but it's
also<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:40.790> for<00:01:41.150> triathlon<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.659> really<00:01:42.049> really

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
also just for triathlon a really really

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.080 
also just for triathlon a really really
nice<00:01:42.500> sensation<00:01:43.010> getting<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:43.640> thing<00:01:43.850> round

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
nice sensation getting this thing round

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.570 
nice sensation getting this thing round
up<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.570> getting<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.320> moving<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:46.159> doesn't

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
up and getting and moving it doesn't

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.160 
up and getting and moving it doesn't
matter<00:01:46.760> what<00:01:46.940> speed<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.360> got<00:01:47.540> whether<00:01:48.020> you're

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
matter what speed you got whether you're

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.190 
matter what speed you got whether you're
doing<00:01:48.380> 25k<00:01:48.890> an<00:01:49.190> hour<00:01:49.520> or<00:01:49.670> 55<00:01:50.270> cutting<00:01:50.659> out<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
doing 25k an hour or 55 cutting out the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.810 
doing 25k an hour or 55 cutting out the
disc<00:01:51.440> is<00:01:51.590> giving<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.010> roughly<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.549> same

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
disc is giving you roughly that same

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.760 
disc is giving you roughly that same
advantage<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.570> in<00:01:54.020> fact<00:01:54.200> for<00:01:54.380> those<00:01:54.470> of<00:01:54.650> us

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
advantage and in fact for those of us

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.080 
advantage and in fact for those of us
that<00:01:54.799> go<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.070> little<00:01:55.310> bit<00:01:55.490> slight<00:01:55.790> in

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
that go a little bit slight in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.670 
that go a little bit slight in
percentage<00:01:56.600> terms<00:01:56.630> we'll<00:01:57.170> actually<00:01:57.350> get<00:01:57.619> a

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
percentage terms we'll actually get a

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.590 
percentage terms we'll actually get a
bigger<00:01:57.979> game<00:01:58.280> out<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.729> changing<00:01:59.090> across<00:01:59.270> with

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
bigger game out of changing across with

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.899 
bigger game out of changing across with
this<00:01:59.780> than<00:02:00.320> someone<00:02:00.680> who<00:02:00.770> goes<00:02:00.920> faster<00:02:01.490> who

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
this than someone who goes faster who

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.520 
this than someone who goes faster who
again<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:02.330> those<00:02:02.630> percentage<00:02:03.080> terms<00:02:03.290> will

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
again in those percentage terms will

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.750 
again in those percentage terms will
actually<00:02:03.830> get<00:02:04.010> a<00:02:04.040> slightly<00:02:04.400> smaller

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
actually get a slightly smaller

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.870 
actually get a slightly smaller
advantage<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.950> that's<00:02:07.130> why<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.369> works

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
advantage so that's why this works

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.130 
advantage so that's why this works
really<00:02:08.090> well<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.660> why<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:08.959> should<00:02:09.110> think

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
really well and why you should think

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.199 
really well and why you should think
about<00:02:09.380> using<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.399> only<00:02:10.519> other<00:02:10.759> question<00:02:10.880> I

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
about using it the only other question I

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.970 
about using it the only other question I
get<00:02:11.360> asked<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.690> lot<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:12.080> how<00:02:12.530> am<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.650> going<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.860> get

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
get asked a lot is how am I going to get

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.470 
get asked a lot is how am I going to get
knocked<00:02:13.190> off<00:02:13.370> or<00:02:13.580> blown<00:02:13.790> around<00:02:13.940> with<00:02:14.330> this

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
knocked off or blown around with this

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.259 
knocked off or blown around with this
and<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.170> answer<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.620> no<00:02:15.769> not<00:02:15.920> really<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.519> most

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
and the answer is no not really in most

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.970 
and the answer is no not really in most
cases<00:02:17.540> there's<00:02:17.989> about<00:02:18.260> six<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.799> eight<00:02:18.830> inches

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
cases there's about six to eight inches

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.729 
cases there's about six to eight inches
of<00:02:19.420> sturdy<00:02:20.420> air<00:02:20.630> going<00:02:20.900> down<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.350> side<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
of sturdy air going down the side of the

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.350 
of sturdy air going down the side of the
bike<00:02:21.980> that's<00:02:22.459> already<00:02:22.820> bounced<00:02:23.180> off<00:02:23.329> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
bike that's already bounced off the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.330 
bike that's already bounced off the
front<00:02:23.750> wheel<00:02:23.959> your<00:02:24.290> body<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.799> knees<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
front wheel your body you knees the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.160 
front wheel your body you knees the
frame<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.299> there's<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.660> thick<00:02:26.959> protective

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
frame so there's this thick protective

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.560 
frame so there's this thick protective
boundary<00:02:27.980> layer<00:02:28.190> between<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> disc<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
boundary layer between the disc and the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.780 
boundary layer between the disc and the
Widman<00:02:29.930> Tinian<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.769> in<00:02:30.890> most<00:02:31.010> cases<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
Widman Tinian so in most cases the the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.940 
Widman Tinian so in most cases the the
gusts<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.630> hit<00:02:32.840> your<00:02:33.020> bike<00:02:33.170> are<00:02:33.470> really<00:02:33.800> just

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
gusts that hit your bike are really just

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.440 
gusts that hit your bike are really just
bouncing<00:02:34.370> off<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.670> front<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.940> your<00:02:35.060> bike<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
bouncing off the front of your bike the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.059 
bouncing off the front of your bike the
front<00:02:35.720> leading<00:02:36.050> edge<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.200> your<00:02:36.410> front<00:02:36.650> wheel

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
front leading edge of your front wheel

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.500 
front leading edge of your front wheel
they're<00:02:37.400> not<00:02:37.519> really<00:02:37.640> affecting<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.180> desk<00:02:38.360> at

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
they're not really affecting the desk at

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.170 
they're not really affecting the desk at
all<00:02:38.629> now<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.409> only<00:02:39.709> time<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.069> changes<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:41.030> in

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
all now the only time that changes is in

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.449 
all now the only time that changes is in
extreme<00:02:41.810> gusts<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.799> kinds<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.159> winds<00:02:43.310> they

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
extreme gusts so the kinds of winds they

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.490 
extreme gusts so the kinds of winds they
get<00:02:43.670> in<00:02:43.790> Kona<00:02:44.000> where<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:44.750> wind<00:02:44.959> gust<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.379> up

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
get in Kona where the wind gust is up

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.949 
get in Kona where the wind gust is up
around<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:45.920> 40<00:02:46.219> or<00:02:46.340> 50<00:02:46.670> knots<00:02:46.879> and<00:02:47.150> it's<00:02:47.689> it's

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
around the 40 or 50 knots and it's it's

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.199 
around the 40 or 50 knots and it's it's
it's<00:02:48.560> fast<00:02:48.920> enough<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.459> pierce<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.879> boundary

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
it's fast enough to pierce the boundary

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.089 
it's fast enough to pierce the boundary
lines<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.719> push<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.140> bike<00:02:51.319> around<00:02:51.500> now

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
lines that push the bike around now

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.190 
lines that push the bike around now
that's<00:02:52.280> extremely<00:02:52.879> unlikely<00:02:53.359> on<00:02:53.659> nearly<00:02:53.959> all

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
that's extremely unlikely on nearly all

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.660 
that's extremely unlikely on nearly all
the<00:02:54.439> courses<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.859> we<00:02:55.040> race<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.400> here<00:02:55.579> in
