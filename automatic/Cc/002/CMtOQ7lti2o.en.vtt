quarterback<00:01:43.439> competition<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> can

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
quarterback competition that you can

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.139 
quarterback competition that you can
argue<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.320> probably<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.619> two<00:01:46.829> spots<00:01:47.220> maybe

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
argue is probably for two spots maybe

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.670 
argue is probably for two spots maybe
three<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.720> they're<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.049> change<00:01:49.350> what

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
three if they're going to change what

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
three if they're going to change what
they've<00:01:49.890> done<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.000> point<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
they've done to get to this point and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.969
