so<00:00:32.140> I'm<00:00:32.439> basically<00:00:33.010> trying<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.760> come<00:00:34.030> up<00:00:34.059> with

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
so I'm basically trying to come up with

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.860 
so I'm basically trying to come up with
an<00:00:34.690> essential<00:00:35.260> contrapposto<00:00:36.040> pose<00:00:36.540> my<00:00:37.540> focus

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
an essential contrapposto pose my focus

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.680 
an essential contrapposto pose my focus
primarily<00:00:38.379> will<00:00:39.250> be<00:00:39.430> on<00:00:39.790> a<00:00:40.120> better

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
primarily will be on a better

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.210 
primarily will be on a better
understanding<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.590> relationship<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.160> the

understanding the relationship of the

understanding the relationship of the
ribcage<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.199> pelvis<00:00:45.040> and<00:00:47.760> when<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:48.790> start

off with is the break in the mid line

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.360 
off with is the break in the mid line
which<00:00:52.269> runs<00:00:52.629> along<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.110> spinal<00:00:53.680> column<00:00:53.980> and

allure of the vertebrae at the top I'm
just<00:00:59.379> going<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.649> think<00:00:59.950> about<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.489> basic

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
just going to think about the basic

just going to think about the basic
shape<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.719> I<00:01:01.750> want<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.210> avoid<00:01:04.930> region

located<00:01:09.550> at<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> rib<00:01:10.390> cage<00:01:10.630> mass<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:17.710> I'm

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
located at the rib cage mass now I'm

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.529 
located at the rib cage mass now I'm
drawing<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.310> in<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.490> white<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.090> makes<00:01:19.300> it

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
drawing it in a white so it makes it

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.580 
drawing it in a white so it makes it
easier<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.580> know<00:01:21.759> lightly<00:01:22.479> knock<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.470> in

and I'm a big fan of revisions if I see

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.140 
and I'm a big fan of revisions if I see
something<00:01:29.619> wrong<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:30.189> try<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.520> fix<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:31.000> right

particular male upper body area at I'm

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.430 
particular male upper body area at I'm
drawing<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.690> here<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:29.110> pelvic

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.530 
drawing as it is here in the pelvic
region<00:02:29.769> and<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:30.730> notice<00:02:31.090> about<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
region and you just notice about the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.569 
region and you just notice about the
same<00:02:31.750> width<00:02:32.049> roughly<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> same<00:02:32.799> heights<00:02:33.310> or

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.030 
so and then halfway through this
boy<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.269> where<00:02:37.480> we're<00:02:37.629> going<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.049> knock<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
on the view that you're trying to draw

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.720 
on the view that you're trying to draw
for<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.959> demonstration<00:02:50.499> I'm<00:02:51.159> probably

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
for this demonstration I'm probably

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.080 
for this demonstration I'm probably
going<00:02:52.030> with<00:02:52.329> more<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.079> posterior<00:02:54.040> view<00:02:54.430> for

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
going with more of a posterior view for

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.199 
going with more of a posterior view for

bone<00:03:08.079> region<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:09.790> known<00:03:10.299> primarily<00:03:10.659> as

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
bone region this is known primarily as

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.860

the<00:03:11.950> halfway<00:03:12.280> mark<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.879> body<00:03:13.090> because

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
the halfway mark of the body because

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.110 
the halfway mark of the body because
from<00:03:14.109> this<00:03:14.290> point<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.400> top<00:03:15.639> of<00:03:15.669> the<00:03:15.909> head

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
from this point to the top of the head

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.589 
from this point to the top of the head
it's<00:03:16.840> roughly<00:03:17.290> about<00:03:17.669> half<00:03:18.669> of<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.120> length<00:03:19.389> of

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
it's roughly about half of the length of

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.509 
it's roughly about half of the length of
the<00:03:19.719> body<00:03:19.930> overall<00:03:20.560> or<00:03:20.919> height<00:03:21.099> of<00:03:21.219> the<00:03:21.310> body

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
the body overall or height of the body

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.879 
the body overall or height of the body
so<00:03:22.299> from<00:03:22.719> here<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.379> here<00:03:24.449> is<00:03:25.449> equal<00:03:26.409> to<00:03:26.709> this

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
so from here to here is equal to this

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.709 
so from here to here is equal to this
distance<00:03:27.280> from<00:03:27.340> here<00:03:27.519> at<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.419> halfway<00:03:28.569> mark

down<00:03:29.469> to<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.829> feet<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:31.150> I'm<00:03:31.209> just<00:03:31.329> going<00:03:31.449> to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
down to the feet so I'm just going to

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.920 
down to the feet so I'm just going to
start<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.079> in<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.500> beginning<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:33.930> I'm

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
start with that in the beginning and I'm

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.539 
start with that in the beginning and I'm
just<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.379> try<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.530> see<00:03:35.799> this<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.189> a<00:03:36.219> mass

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
just going to try to see this is a mass

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.020 
just going to try to see this is a mass
and<00:03:36.939> look<00:03:37.689> for<00:03:37.959> simple<00:03:38.560> shapes<00:03:38.949> within<00:03:39.760> this

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
and look for simple shapes within this

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.030 
and look for simple shapes within this
mess<00:03:40.530> with<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.650> basic<00:03:42.129> shape<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:42.729> pelvis

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
mess with the basic shape of the pelvis

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:56.350 
mess with the basic shape of the pelvis
coming<00:03:45.040> together

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.199 

great<00:03:57.360> trochanter<00:03:58.110> and<00:04:01.610> how<00:04:02.610> about<00:04:02.730> how<00:04:02.970> long

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
great trochanter and how about how long

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.199 
great trochanter and how about how long
do<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.540> make<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.200> femoral<00:04:04.620> boom<00:04:05.190> well<00:04:05.910> that's

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
do I make the femoral boom well that's

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.180 
do I make the femoral boom well that's
pretty<00:04:06.420> easy<00:04:06.540> i<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:07.170> take<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.680> distance

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
pretty easy i just take this distance

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.199 
pretty easy i just take this distance
from<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:09.300> rough<00:04:09.510> halfway<00:04:10.080> mark<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.970> body

the top of the head to the halfway mark

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.440 
the top of the head to the halfway mark
have<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:28.229> that<00:04:28.320> distance<00:04:28.860> from<00:04:29.729> here<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.060> here

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
have for that distance from here to here

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.260 
have for that distance from here to here
it<00:04:30.630> or<00:04:30.930> from<00:04:31.380> here<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.860> here<00:04:32.100> this<00:04:32.820> would<00:04:33.090> be

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
it or from here to here this would be

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.480 
it or from here to here this would be
like<00:04:33.300> your<00:04:33.780> leg<00:04:33.990> bones<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.620> femur<00:04:35.040> or<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
like your leg bones of the femur or the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.110 
like your leg bones of the femur or the
tibia<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.960> distance<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:38.190> that's<00:04:38.669> how<00:04:38.820> i<00:04:38.850> can

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
tibia this distance so that's how i can

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.969 
tibia this distance so that's how i can
check<00:04:39.240> myself<00:04:39.479> early<00:04:40.229> on<00:04:40.380> with<00:04:40.530> just<00:04:40.770> very

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
check myself early on with just very

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.870 
check myself early on with just very
little<00:04:41.430> on<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.669> page<00:04:42.410> from<00:04:43.410> there<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.880> started

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
little on the page from there I started

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.440 
little on the page from there I started
thinking<00:04:45.419> about<00:04:46.520> just<00:04:47.520> something<00:04:48.090> really

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
thinking about just something really

00:04:48.450 --> 00:05:02.279 
thinking about just something really
simple

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.700 

with<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.099> way<00:05:03.249> the<00:05:03.669> group<00:05:03.909> cage<00:05:04.119> maps<00:05:04.710> might

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
with the way the group cage maps might

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.679 
with the way the group cage maps might
be<00:05:05.860> shaded<00:05:06.309> in<00:05:06.490> if<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.939> light<00:05:07.119> was<00:05:07.149> coming<00:05:07.360> in

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:07.689 
be shaded in if the light was coming in

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:15.420 
be shaded in if the light was coming in
from<00:05:07.839> this<00:05:08.050> side<00:05:08.379> and<00:05:13.649> again<00:05:14.649> i'm<00:05:14.919> primarily

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
from this side and again i'm primarily

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.939 
from this side and again i'm primarily
constituting<00:05:16.360> my<00:05:16.449> attention<00:05:16.990> on<00:05:17.199> what's

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
constituting my attention on what's

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.570 
constituting my attention on what's
happening<00:05:18.460> on<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:19.080> area<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.229> body<00:05:20.580> from

the rib cage match to the pub's because

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.689 
the rib cage match to the pub's because
so<00:05:23.289> much<00:05:23.439> of<00:05:23.499> the<00:05:23.740> movement<00:05:24.219> that<00:05:24.309> the<00:05:24.430> pose<00:05:24.669> of

so much of the movement that the pose of

so much of the movement that the pose of
a<00:05:25.059> pose<00:05:25.330> is<00:05:25.599> dependent<00:05:26.499> on<00:05:26.649> what's<00:05:27.009> happening

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:27.399 
a pose is dependent on what's happening
