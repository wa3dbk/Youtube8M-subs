know<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.920> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
know if you can see that it it is so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.360 
know if you can see that it it is so
interesting

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.330 

hmmm<00:02:11.370> that's<00:02:11.700> pretty<00:02:12.030> interesting<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.920> like

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
hmmm that's pretty interesting I do like

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.800 
hmmm that's pretty interesting I do like
the<00:02:14.519> one<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:16.640> right<00:02:17.640> off<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.910> bat<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.420> noticed

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the one like right off the bat I noticed

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.110 
the one like right off the bat I noticed
that<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.610> gives<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.940> lot<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.180> volume<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:23.120> like

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that it gives a lot of volume and like

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.809 
that it gives a lot of volume and like
really<00:02:24.930> conical<00:02:25.530> combs<00:02:25.860> through<00:02:26.129> your<00:02:26.310> lashes

really conical combs through your lashes

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.630 
really conical combs through your lashes
the<00:02:27.510> formula<00:02:28.140> feels<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.950> really<00:02:29.280> wet

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the formula feels like a really wet

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.380 
the formula feels like a really wet
formula<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.819> don't<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.060> care<00:02:33.360> for

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
formula so if you don't really care for

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.210 
formula so if you don't really care for
a<00:02:33.599> wet<00:02:33.750> formula<00:02:34.200> mascaras<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.890> might<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
a wet formula mascaras you might want to

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.100 
a wet formula mascaras you might want to
let<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.489> one<00:02:35.670> dry<00:02:35.940> out<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> little<00:02:36.360> bit<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:42.110> like

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110

let this one dry out a little bit I like
how<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.620> one<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.400> shaped<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.209> it's

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
how the one is shaped because it's

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.600 
how the one is shaped because it's
smaller<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.470> inner<00:02:46.650> corner<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.459> can

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
smaller and the inner corner and you can

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.640 
smaller and the inner corner and you can
kind<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.849> get<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.480> while<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.319> rest<00:02:49.470> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
kind of get right in while the rest of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the bristles are still getting to the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.119 
the bristles are still getting to the
the<00:02:54.510> lashes<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.290> really<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.739> how<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.980> can

I<00:03:46.169> like<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.560> formula<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.579> how<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.880> builds

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
I like the formula I like how it builds

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.170 
I like the formula I like how it builds
this<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.079> just<00:03:49.319> one<00:03:49.709> ish<00:03:50.130> coat<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.760> guys<00:03:50.910> saw<00:03:51.150> I

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
this is just one ish coat you guys saw I

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.970 
this is just one ish coat you guys saw I
went<00:03:51.450> over<00:03:51.599> at<00:03:51.690> several<00:03:52.049> times<00:03:52.079> but<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.739> would

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
went over at several times but I would

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.589 
went over at several times but I would
consider<00:03:53.099> this<00:03:53.459> one<00:03:53.760> coat<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.180> would<00:03:54.329> let<00:03:54.480> this

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
consider this one coat I would let this

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.800 
consider this one coat I would let this
dry<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:54.959> then<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:56.209> will<00:03:57.209> let<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.480> set<00:03:57.780> a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
dry and then I will let this set a

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.449 
dry and then I will let this set a
minute<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.349> then<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.530> would<00:03:58.769> build<00:03:58.980> upon<00:03:59.310> it

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
minute and then I would build upon it

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.539 
minute and then I would build upon it
let<00:03:59.609> me<00:03:59.639> try<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.239> do<00:04:00.329> my<00:04:00.480> lower<00:04:00.750> lashes<00:04:04.220> use<00:04:05.220> I

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
let me try and do my lower lashes use I

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:15.620 
let me try and do my lower lashes use I
used<00:04:06.000> like<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:07.280> more<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.310> angled<00:04:09.180> side

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.530 

those<00:04:16.630> are<00:04:16.780> nice<00:04:17.400> okay<00:04:18.400> I'm<00:04:18.549> gonna<00:04:18.699> go<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.239> for

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
those are nice okay I'm gonna go in for

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:28.140 
those are nice okay I'm gonna go in for
one<00:04:20.109> more<00:04:20.350> coat<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:26.610> really<00:04:27.610> think<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
one more coat I really think that the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.879 
one more coat I really think that the
way<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.630> brush<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:28.900> formed<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.650> gives

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
way that the brush is formed it gives

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.909 
way that the brush is formed it gives
you<00:04:30.040> a<00:04:30.070> lot<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.520> movement<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:32.080> lashes<00:04:32.650> to

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
you a lot of movement to the lashes to

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.219 
you a lot of movement to the lashes to
be<00:04:33.310> able<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.729> grip<00:04:34.060> them<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.600> kind<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:34.900> place

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
be able to grip them and kind of place

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.189 
be able to grip them and kind of place
them<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:35.740> like<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.490> pull<00:04:36.760> these<00:04:37.090> lashes<00:04:37.419> inward

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
them I like to pull these lashes inward

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.860 
them I like to pull these lashes inward
these<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.220> middle<00:04:39.460> lashes<00:04:39.850> upward<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:40.660> then

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
these the middle lashes upward and then

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.650 
these the middle lashes upward and then
the<00:04:41.229> outer<00:04:41.740> lashes<00:04:42.160> outward<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.449> think

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
the outer lashes outward and I think

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.990 
the outer lashes outward and I think
this<00:04:43.810> brush<00:04:44.080> really<00:04:44.440> gives<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:45.160> lot<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.430> great

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
this brush really gives a lot of great

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.750 
this brush really gives a lot of great
grip<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.320> lashes<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.100> just<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.460> way<00:04:48.580> it's

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
grip to the lashes and just the way it's

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.610 
grip to the lashes and just the way it's
shaped<00:04:49.060> it<00:04:49.330> lets<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.690> get<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:50.169> all<00:04:50.440> those
