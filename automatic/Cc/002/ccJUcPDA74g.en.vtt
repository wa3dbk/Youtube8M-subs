00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:13.550
 hello friends ask here they say 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.929
 some states but allow freezing 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.329
 and it's cold there because the freezing stats 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:22.970
 so I'm not okay, not like there 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.980
 then you know numb well of course from below he 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.739
 sometimes cold happens and year like this 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.359
 media 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:34.219
 tell show freezing state 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.980
 I can be you give a cough and take 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.269
 like the media in general 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.949
 some climatic anomalies there 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.120
 cover the matter is that if 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.219
 takes on the character 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.969
 some disaster but then let us go 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.859
 flooded new york is one story 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.350
 if somewhere there is a high temperature or 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:58.519
 there is low or snow a lot but 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.999
 something like that is cool 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.700
 Accordingly, it means that the subject is 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.730
 cool it takes less time it 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.710
 will be more entertaining than 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.770
 let's say something where call for 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.040
 sympathize there and so on but 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.890
 substantially as if news in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.550
 the united states is of character 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.220
 take local and so what 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.880
 happens outside of my local 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.860
 a place somewhere out there she lives wrong 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.590
 so that someone interested there 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.290
 here so it turns out therefore in local 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.600
 news if something goes on 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.880
 state or level there 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.780
 countries then this must have something very 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.380
 very noticeable 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.040
 there are channels which by their nature 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.950
 national federal yes of course 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.110
 that is, let's say cnn there or there 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.049
 let's say fox news 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.149
 radically different there 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.450
 who are here under the TV and turned on here 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.689
 local guides go things so there 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.190
 more attention to this will be 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:14.620
 given but the idea is such that the less 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.239
 consequences at the level of disaster 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 some 700 thousand will be less 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.450
 attention that in general is naturally well 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.810
 Well, so here we will tell more 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.550
 should be spectacular so let's say let's say 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.260
 if a lot of snow should be seen that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.910
 its a lot it should be interesting 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.670
 there must be some video 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.319
 such here is nothing more suitable nothing 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.750
 especially i think that like any other 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.180
 the country is unlikely the United States something 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.480
 in this sense, they differ moreover 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.060
 what's local news dominates 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.049
 local channels that's all 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.049
 arrived at the gas station
