cone so let's get started with this
drawing<00:00:18.390> we're<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> first<00:00:19.050> start<00:00:19.289> by

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
drawing we're going to first start by

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.830 
drawing we're going to first start by
drawing<00:00:19.680> our<00:00:19.859> top<00:00:20.100> ice<00:00:20.310> cream<00:00:20.640> scoop<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.180> by

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
drawing our top ice cream scoop so by

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.660 
drawing our top ice cream scoop so by
right<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.289> we're<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> draw<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> curve

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
right here we're going to draw a curve

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.970 
right here we're going to draw a curve
so<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:24.930> start<00:00:25.380> draw<00:00:26.160> curve<00:00:26.580> like<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
so right here start draw curve like this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.589 
so right here start draw curve like this
now<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.460> right<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> start

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
now but right here we're going to start

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.069 
now but right here we're going to start
by<00:00:30.810> drawing<00:00:30.869> our<00:00:31.439> bow<00:00:34.340> like<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.719> little<00:00:36.719> oval

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
by drawing our bow like that little oval

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:47.139 
by drawing our bow like that little oval
and<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:41.270> bows<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> side<00:00:44.690> like<00:00:45.690> that

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
and the two bows on the side like that

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
and the two bows on the side like that
and<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.719> continue<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.379> curve<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and now we can continue this curve that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.970 
and now we can continue this curve that
goes<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.760> way<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:52.170> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
goes all the way to the other side so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.100 
goes all the way to the other side so
just<00:00:53.579> imagine<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.180> curve<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
just imagine this curve going all the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.319 
just imagine this curve going all the
way<00:00:55.230> over<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.719> bring<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> other<00:00:58.260> side

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
way over and bring it to the other side

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.650 
way over and bring it to the other side
like<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:01.640> since<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:02.820> using<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.210> sharpie

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
like that since I'm using a sharpie

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
like that since I'm using a sharpie
that's<00:01:03.899> why<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.229> drawing<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.769> Kurvers<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that's why I'm drawing this Kurvers and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
that's why I'm drawing this Kurvers and
then<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> bow<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.689> curve<00:01:06.990> if

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
then the bow and then this curve if

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
then the bow and then this curve if
you're<00:01:07.439> using<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.830> pencil<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.850> draw<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> curve

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you're using a pencil just draw a curve

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.179 
you're using a pencil just draw a curve
that<00:01:09.540> goes<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.920> can

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that goes all the way and then you can

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.830 
that goes all the way and then you can
draw<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:11.580> bow<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.119> erase<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> lines

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
draw your bow and just erase the lines

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.550 
draw your bow and just erase the lines
that'd<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.650> much<00:01:13.830> easier<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:15.270> here

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
that'd be much easier and right here

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.210 
that'd be much easier and right here
just<00:01:16.560> start<00:01:16.830> start<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> draw<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:17.820> curves<00:01:19.220> so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
just start start to draw our curves so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
just start start to draw our curves so
one<00:01:20.670> curve<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> were<00:01:22.200> drawing

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
one curve kind of as if you were drawing

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.679 
one curve kind of as if you were drawing
a<00:01:22.619> fluffy<00:01:23.009> cloud<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.610> let's<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.360> into<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a fluffy cloud and let's go into the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
a fluffy cloud and let's go into the
other<00:01:24.780> side<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> draw<00:01:25.409> another<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
other side and draw another one on the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.539 
other side and draw another one on the
same<00:01:26.930> like<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> side<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> other

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
same like like this side on the other

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
same like like this side on the other
side<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> connected

side like that and now we can connected

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.240 
side like that and now we can connected
with<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.369> curves<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:35.600> two<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.770> kind

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
with more curves so one two you see kind

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
with more curves so one two you see kind
of<00:01:38.310> eyeball<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.880> how<00:01:39.000> many<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> fit

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.860 
of ice cream so right here we're going
to<00:02:19.530> draw<00:02:19.709> another<00:02:19.980> curve<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.610> comes<00:02:20.870> down

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to draw another curve that comes down

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.480 
to draw another curve that comes down
like<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.270> other<00:02:24.270> side<00:02:24.600> as<00:02:24.810> well

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
like that and other side as well

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.000 
like that and other side as well
curve<00:02:26.490> comes<00:02:27.000> down<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.350> when<00:02:28.920> you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
curve comes down like that so when you

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.920 
curve comes down like that so when you
draw<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.490> one<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:30.240> make<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.570> slightly

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
draw this one just make it slightly

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.860 
draw this one just make it slightly
bigger<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.830> kind<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.130> imagine<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.540> thing

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
bigger just kind of imagine the thing

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.290 
bigger just kind of imagine the thing
just<00:02:34.620> kind<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.980> coming<00:02:35.310> outwards<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:36.060> that

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
just kind of coming outwards like that

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.780 
just kind of coming outwards like that
so<00:02:36.510> don't<00:02:36.750> make<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.020> scoop<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.830> down<00:02:38.130> in

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
so don't make the scoop you know down in

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.130 
so don't make the scoop you know down in
here<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.420> too<00:02:39.630> small

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
here be too small

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.890 
here be too small
make<00:02:40.590> sure<00:02:40.770> it's<00:02:40.920> fatter<00:02:41.700> than<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> top<00:02:42.360> and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
make sure it's fatter than the top and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.340 
make sure it's fatter than the top and
the<00:02:43.560> same<00:02:43.800> thing<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.370> top<00:02:44.989> draw<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.020> curve

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
the same thing like the top draw a curve

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.790 
the same thing like the top draw a curve
like<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.040> go<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.090> other<00:02:48.239> side<00:02:48.800> another

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
like that go to the other side another

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.240 
like that go to the other side another
curve<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:51.270> kind<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.600> see<00:02:51.930> how<00:02:52.260> many<00:02:53.100> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
curve and just kind of see how many you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.140 
curve and just kind of see how many you
can<00:02:53.459> fit<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:55.500> two<00:02:55.950> three<00:02:56.930> four<00:02:58.550> five<00:02:59.550> maybe

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
can fit it so two three four five maybe

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.610 
can fit it so two three four five maybe
one<00:03:00.720> more<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.120> very<00:03:03.120> simple<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.200> so

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
and right here let's just give him

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.260 
and right here let's just give him
curved<00:03:47.990> line<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.500> top<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.860> his<00:03:49.010> I<00:03:49.190> just<00:03:50.060> give

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
curved line on top of his I just give

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.960 
curved line on top of his I just give
him<00:03:50.390> some<00:03:50.600> character<00:03:51.310> another<00:03:52.310> one<00:03:52.580> on<00:03:52.760> that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
him some character another one on that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.770 
him some character another one on that
side<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.690> let's<00:03:54.560> give<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.800> cute<00:03:55.520> smile<00:03:56.120> right

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
side and let's give a cute smile right

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.830 
side and let's give a cute smile right
in<00:03:57.170> between<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:58.400> two<00:03:58.610> eyes<00:03:58.790> like<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.420> and

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
in between the two eyes like that and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.670 
in between the two eyes like that and
now<00:04:00.650> we<00:04:00.890> can<00:04:01.220> draw<00:04:01.489> or<00:04:01.700> sugar<00:04:02.000> cone<00:04:02.330> so<00:04:03.230> it's

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
now we can draw or sugar cone so it's

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.280 
now we can draw or sugar cone so it's
kind<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:03.980> imagine<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.730> center<00:04:05.300> this<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:05.959> where

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
kind of imagine the center this is where

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.220 
kind of imagine the center this is where
you<00:04:06.470> kind<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.709> want<00:04:06.770> your<00:04:07.100> cone<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:08.330> n<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:09.050> you

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
you kind of want your cone to n so you

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.050 
you kind of want your cone to n so you
can<00:04:09.470> kind<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.709> put<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.310> thought<00:04:10.580> right<00:04:10.819> there

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
can kind of put the thought right there

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.140 
can kind of put the thought right there
so<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.239> kind<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.569> know<00:04:11.900> where<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.220> angle<00:04:14.120> your

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
so you kind of know where to angle your

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.140 
so you kind of know where to angle your
cone<00:04:14.540> ad<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.140> but<00:04:15.860> right<00:04:16.070> here<00:04:16.100> we're<00:04:16.970> going<00:04:17.090> to

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
cone ad so but right here we're going to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.080 
cone ad so but right here we're going to
draw<00:04:17.470> an<00:04:18.470> angle<00:04:18.620> line<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.220> goes<00:04:19.370> straight<00:04:19.700> down

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
draw an angle line it goes straight down

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.260 
draw an angle line it goes straight down
kind<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.260> where<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:21.590> put<00:04:21.769> that<00:04:21.950> point<00:04:22.310> like

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
kind of to where we put that point like

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.890 
kind of to where we put that point like
that<00:04:23.710> same<00:04:24.710> thing<00:04:24.890> on<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.070> other<00:04:25.130> side<00:04:25.900> all

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
that same thing on the other side all

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.090 
that same thing on the other side all
the<00:04:27.470> way<00:04:27.620> down<00:04:27.980> with<00:04:28.220> your<00:04:28.340> angle<00:04:28.700> line<00:04:28.880> and

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
the way down with your angle line and

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.890 
the way down with your angle line and
right<00:04:31.100> here<00:04:31.370> we're<00:04:31.610> just<00:04:31.640> going<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.970> curve<00:04:32.510> it

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
right here we're just going to curve it

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.950 
right here we're just going to curve it
just<00:04:33.560> soften<00:04:33.950> it<00:04:34.100> out<00:04:34.250> like<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.720> it's<00:04:35.870> not

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
just soften it out like that so it's not

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.100 
just soften it out like that so it's not
to<00:04:36.229> point<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.890> a<00:04:36.919> curve<00:04:37.540> soft<00:04:38.540> point<00:04:38.870> like<00:04:39.080> that

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
to point to a curve soft point like that
