00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.270
 let's work on a rack myself 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.100
 I'm working on a wood and what 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.280
 first thing I did was work with base 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.439
 light blue acrylic baby once 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.439
 give the flat acrylic base what we're going 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:24.340
 to do is with a stencil in this case 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.800
 it looks like a cloth and acrylic earth 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.380
 shadow toast with dry brush let's 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.540
 work on the entire surface very 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.140
 well finished this what we are going to do 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.420
 is sanding the sausages a little 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.510
 to wear the surface and that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.900
 look like a pretty aged fabric 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.250
 very well finished this what we do 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.380
 is to transfer only the edge of the flower 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.710
 in this case of the rose that I'm going to 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.180
 work because the edge because I'm going to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.130
 start from the dark and then 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.299
 making a mix of shadow earth 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:07.920
 Toast with white I will give all the 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.259
 base to that rose that I worked 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 after we do that we're going to 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.600
 transfer if with an acre with a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.070
 carbonic all the internal part of the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.530
 pink and then there the work starts 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.250
 principal of this table and how 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.830
 we are going to be careful 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 in how are we putting the flower together 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.350
 based on the model that we have 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 we are going to give the first targets 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.890
 directly on this land of shadow 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.440
 toast whiter than I put together brushstroke 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.319
 pretty sloppy i what I want is 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.540
 make a first layer that's going to 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.450
 work different color 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.300
 that if I put the target directly 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.830
 on the surface because because already 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.860
 I have a toasted shade base down 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.070
 whiter than my color will be 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.429
 the darker color that after I'll 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.100
 reinforce also with the dark ones 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.340
 directly with the toasted shadow I'm going to 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.250
 work then assembling the petals if 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.290
 you see that the flower is transferred 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.310
 is transferred with a carbon in 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.400
 this white case and there comes to gabi 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.480
 Babic is lucky that it's obvious to me 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.030
 olive good look and I think that the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.920
 resolution is quite simple I 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.440
 it seems easier than if we start with 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.060
 the whites exactly because I already have 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.610
 the dark one that afterwards I 'm going to 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.640
 reinforce I keep giving you look 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.730
 whites but I already brought another stage that is 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.770
 the bottom part of the flower that is here 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.290
 we can discover it because the dark 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.850
 serves as a border to delimit the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.580
 petals that go on top of each other 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.620
 exactly is very good at the moment and 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.230
 now if I started working with 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.050
 glaze then I will use a brush 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.250
 clean'll put the icing to look 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.550
 that or notice that here I already have all 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.620
 petals and dice with white that is already 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.360
 I have the petals finished and now what 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.000
 I'm going to do 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.910
 using the glaze, I will work 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.130
 again the whites because I gave only 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.060
 a layer of white then I have to 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.150
 strengthen and health because the rose flower 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.250
 it's a white rose then once 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.800
 the glaze I will work with white yes 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.890
 reinforcing the targets of these of these 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.770
 petals and I will also get with very 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.959
 little white to these dark 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.000
 if every time you still see what 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.120
 dark and it will be and to feel exactly 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.760
 who is white but I have that shadow 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.030
 down then I will take part 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.030
 of the toasted shadow I already have the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.120
 glaze down and then what does 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.430
 the glacier the glaze after lights or 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.440
 it makes the color more translucent and 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.040
 I will also work with some dyes 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.110
 of land of natural Siena because it is that 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.709
 finally I always end up working 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.709
 with the same 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.570
 the land of shadow of toast I think 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.780
 that is in all my works with the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.470
 browns have to do with home in 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.920
 the earth the home the family will be 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.550
 for that harmonic case 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.220
 in family flag the home and there I go 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.669
 look before you show the house 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.790
 I'm passing the mobile and then I'm going 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.370
 and there I am doing this and then no longer 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.130
 I have time 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.800
 and one more minute what I want is 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.530
 simply because the background has me 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.130
 I say it's like dramatic then 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.410
 it also has the glaze and with gray 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.889
 paint I will make all these shadows 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.100
 while for showing the knowledge of viva 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.580
 I continue with this white more in the magazine 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.530
 of eternal as well says monica godfroid 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.380
 remember to be presented this the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.780
 Previous time is full of techniques 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.020
 interview works 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.380
 and here inside look at the work there you see 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.260
 the work of mónica godfroid that is a 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.350
 imitation metal inspired by a job 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.320
 from parents vilaró loved it 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.550

 best artistic of the country 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.530
 it's very economical and if the lord of the 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.500
 bookstore does not have it does not have the magazine 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.930

 use and now have it in your home is 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.440
 well exactly at the end of the lord

 Garitano not to the boyfriend of liberality and 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.430

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.530
 infinite techniques there is explanation of 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.950
 the products and there are many jobs with 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:14.140
