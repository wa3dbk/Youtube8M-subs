00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.140 

that<00:02:53.290> was<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.590> transistor<00:02:54.250> organ<00:02:54.550> setting<00:02:54.940> it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
that was the transistor organ setting it

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.880 
that was the transistor organ setting it
actually<00:02:55.569> has<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> tremolo<00:02:56.050> instead<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.739> a

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
actually has a tremolo instead of a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.280 
actually has a tremolo instead of a
rotary<00:02:57.280> speaker<00:02:57.550> effect<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.270> we've<00:02:59.110> been

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
rotary speaker effect on it we've been

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.170 
rotary speaker effect on it we've been
listening<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.830> b9<00:03:00.190> making<00:03:00.790> your<00:03:00.910> guitar

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
listening to the b9 making your guitar

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.089 
listening to the b9 making your guitar
sound<00:03:01.390> exactly<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:02.170> an<00:03:02.319> organ<00:03:02.620> what<00:03:02.980> we're

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
sound exactly like an organ what we're

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.610 
sound exactly like an organ what we're
going<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.280> do<00:03:03.400> now<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.880> play<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.020> context

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
going to do now is play it in context

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.880 
going to do now is play it in context
with<00:03:05.830> your<00:03:06.099> clean<00:03:06.370> guitar<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.680> kind

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
with your clean guitar so it's just kind

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.830 
with your clean guitar so it's just kind
of<00:03:08.920> backing<00:03:09.370> up<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.670> sound<00:03:09.970> giving<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.780> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
of backing up the sound giving it a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.020 
of backing up the sound giving it a
little<00:03:10.989> bit<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.260> fullness<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.819> take<00:03:13.000> a

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
little bit of fullness it can take a
