you know and bigger devices as well kind
of<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.490> brief<00:01:17.640> history<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> DMB<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> was

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
of a brief history of DMB it was

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710 
of a brief history of DMB it was
originally<00:01:19.650> meant<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.909> used<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
originally meant to be used as a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
originally meant to be used as a
replacement<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.439> FM<00:01:22.920> radio<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> don't

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
replacement for FM radio but I don't

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
replacement for FM radio but I don't
think<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.150> taken<00:01:27.810> root<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.200> much

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
think that's really taken root as much

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.740 
think that's really taken root as much
as<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.920> hoped<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> would<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:30.119> available<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
as they hoped it would it's available in

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.060 
as they hoped it would it's available in
a<00:01:30.840> couple<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.409> countries<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:31.979> they're

few other places now the reason you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
few other places now the reason you
cannot<00:01:45.540> use<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> US<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:47.159> the

cannot use it in the US is because the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.810 
cannot use it in the US is because the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
terrestrial DMB uses transmissions on

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.550 
terrestrial DMB uses transmissions on
band<00:01:54.210> 3<00:01:54.479> which<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.689> VHF<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> L<00:01:56.250> which<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.610> UHF

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
band 3 which is VHF and L which is UHF

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.440 
band 3 which is VHF and L which is UHF
now<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.619> problem<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.119> North<00:02:00.360> America

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
now the problem is that in North America

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.109 
now the problem is that in North America
we<00:02:00.960> use<00:02:01.140> obviously<00:02:01.469> VHF<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.700> television

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
we use obviously VHF for television

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.910 
we use obviously VHF for television
broadcasting<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:05.509> UHF<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.780> reserved<00:02:07.649> for

English that I have seen they might have
a<00:02:51.419> few<00:02:52.609> but<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.700> majority<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.239> obviously

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
a few but the majority of it obviously
