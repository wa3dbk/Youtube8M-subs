00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
easiest way to do this in my opinion is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
easiest way to do this in my opinion is
to<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> weekly<00:00:43.469> heroic<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:44.129> level

few buddies you can get it done in like
30<00:00:48.870> minutes<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.100> step<00:00:50.430> 2<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.660> complete<00:00:52.170> 25

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
strikes that is a ton of strikes it's a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590 
strikes that is a ton of strikes it's a
lot<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> strikes<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.850> easiest<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> do

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
lot of strikes and the easiest way to do

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
lot of strikes and the easiest way to do
this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.530> doubles<00:00:59.039> layer<00:00:59.250> over<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this is just do doubles layer over and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.490 
this is just do doubles layer over and
over<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.149> over<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.539> sounds<00:01:00.899> incredibly

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
over and over it sounds incredibly

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
over and over it sounds incredibly
boring<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.030> want<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.600> done

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
boring but if you want to get this done

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.560 
boring but if you want to get this done
as<00:01:04.140> quickly<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.619> possible<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.970> suggest

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
as quickly as possible then I suggest

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740 
as quickly as possible then I suggest
doing<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.130> step<00:01:08.130> 3<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> bring<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> black

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
doing that step 3 is to bring the black

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.899 
doing that step 3 is to bring the black
market<00:01:10.229> coin<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.830> xur<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.460> normally<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
market coin to xur now normally I

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
market coin to xur now normally I
wouldn't<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.869> signify<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.650> as<00:01:13.830> an

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
wouldn't you know signify this as an

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.090 
wouldn't you know signify this as an
individual<00:01:14.430> step<00:01:14.820> however<00:01:15.390> xur<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.710> agent

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
individual step however xur is the agent

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
individual step however xur is the agent
