Street more Regent Street than it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.270 
Street more Regent Street than it
actually<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:58.140> did<00:00:58.320> look<00:00:58.469> into<00:00:58.710> using<00:00:58.920> real

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
actually is we did look into using real

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
actually is we did look into using real
taxes<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.090> they're<00:01:00.270> too<00:01:00.510> heavy<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.170> too

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
taxes but they're too heavy and it's too

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
taxes but they're too heavy and it's too
dangerous<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.520> end<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.789> took<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> cast

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
dangerous so in the end we took a cast

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.620 
dangerous so in the end we took a cast
of<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> more<00:01:05.159> vintage<00:01:06.000> style<00:01:06.390> ones

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630

it's called a fairway

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.670 
it's called a fairway
I<00:01:08.090> think<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> fairway<00:01:09.570> taxi<00:01:09.990> symbolized<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I think the fairway taxi symbolized the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
I think the fairway taxi symbolized the
60s<00:01:11.189> where<00:01:11.520> London<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.180> exciting

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
60s where London was very exciting

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.450 
60s where London was very exciting
they're<00:01:13.320> quite<00:01:13.560> regal<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.130> almost<00:01:14.250> look

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
they're quite regal they almost look

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.719 
they're quite regal they almost look
like<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> Rolls<00:01:14.850> Royce<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:19.470> chose<00:01:19.799> truly

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
like a Rolls Royce I just chose truly

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
like a Rolls Royce I just chose truly
ridiculous<00:01:21.150> elements<00:01:21.840> funny<00:01:22.290> sort<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
ridiculous elements funny sort of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
ridiculous elements funny sort of
English<00:01:22.979> icons<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.000> there's<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> unicorn

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I thought each taxi needs to have its

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
I thought each taxi needs to have its
own<00:01:30.990> story<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> different<00:01:31.860> color<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> different

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.550 
theme a different vibe the thousand
bones<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> sort<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
