after<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:19.299> bought<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.780> code<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.619> put<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.159> SIM

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
after I bought the code I put the SIM

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.399 
after I bought the code I put the SIM
card<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.270> phone<00:01:22.479> started<00:01:22.900> asking<00:01:23.380> for

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
card and the phone started asking for

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.940 
card and the phone started asking for
the<00:01:23.680> unlock<00:01:24.009> code<00:01:24.040> which<00:01:24.729> I<00:01:25.090> had<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.110> when<00:01:26.920> I

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
the unlock code which I had and when I

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.859 
the unlock code which I had and when I
tried<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.340> input<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.240> ah

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
tried to input it ah

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.700 
tried to input it ah
the<00:01:29.740> phone<00:01:29.950> would<00:01:30.130> says<00:01:30.460> Network<00:01:31.119> request

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the phone would says Network request

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.240 
the phone would says Network request
unsuccessful<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:35.320> kind<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.799> grabbed<00:01:36.070> my

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
unsuccessful so it kind of grabbed my

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.090 
unsuccessful so it kind of grabbed my
attention<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.240> I<00:01:37.689> thought<00:01:38.170> maybe<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.829> first

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
attention and I thought maybe the first

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.210 
attention and I thought maybe the first
seller<00:01:39.630> soul<00:01:40.630> being<00:01:40.869> code<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.649> didn't<00:01:41.979> work

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
seller soul being code that didn't work

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.480 
seller soul being code that didn't work
and<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.409> figured<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:45.189> there<00:01:45.310> was

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and then I figured that there was

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.719 
and then I figured that there was
something<00:01:45.969> else<00:01:46.149> going<00:01:46.329> on<00:01:46.750> there<00:01:47.399> after<00:01:48.399> I

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
something else going on there after I

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.569 
something else going on there after I
ordered<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.869> same<00:01:50.140> code<00:01:50.799> from<00:01:51.219> a<00:01:51.340> different

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
ordered the same code from a different

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.760 
ordered the same code from a different
seller<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.540> turned<00:01:52.810> out<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.229> be<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.530> same

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
seller and it turned out to be the same

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.530 
seller and it turned out to be the same
number<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.659> I<00:01:55.990> figured<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:57.219> that<00:01:57.549> probably<00:01:58.420> I'm

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
number so I figured on that probably I'm

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.270 
number so I figured on that probably I'm
not<00:01:58.750> alone<00:01:59.020> there<00:01:59.380> some<00:01:59.680> people<00:01:59.979> who<00:02:00.070> has

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
not alone there some people who has

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.550 
not alone there some people who has
bought<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.909> load<00:02:01.119> codes<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.840> don't<00:02:02.079> work<00:02:02.289> for

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
bought on load codes that don't work for

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.459 
bought on load codes that don't work for
your<00:02:02.649> Galaxy<00:02:03.189> s4<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.630> went<00:02:04.960> on<00:02:05.079> looking<00:02:05.439> for
