I<00:00:02.360> don't<00:00:02.780> know<00:00:02.930> why<00:00:03.170> I<00:00:03.200> stopped<00:00:03.590> recording<00:00:04.010> but

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
I don't know why I stopped recording but

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.840 
I don't know why I stopped recording but
it's<00:00:04.819> just<00:00:05.290> anyway<00:00:06.290> i'm<00:00:06.410> still<00:00:06.680> going<00:00:06.890> here

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
it's just anyway i'm still going here

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.310 
it's just anyway i'm still going here
one<00:00:09.240> point<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:09.720> nine<00:00:10.020> volts

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.720 

this<00:00:15.799> is<00:00:16.039> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.929

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
5.0 2 gigahertz I got the voltage at one

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.150 
5.0 2 gigahertz I got the voltage at one

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
the cpu northbridge problems are running

the cpu northbridge problems are running
two<00:00:34.449> minutes<00:00:34.809> now<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.480> it<00:00:37.780> just<00:00:38.050> stopped

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
two minutes now and it just stopped

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.590 
two minutes now and it just stopped
mother

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.590 

and<00:00:43.140> while<00:00:43.320> held<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:44.519> home<00:00:44.699> for<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.329> minutes

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
and while held it home for two minutes

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.990 
and while held it home for two minutes
there<00:00:46.190> soon<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.609> the<00:00:47.760> voltage<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.359> 1.75

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
there soon as it up the voltage to 1.75

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
there soon as it up the voltage to 1.75
but<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.839> think<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.620> gonna<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:52.980> any

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
but I do not think that I'm gonna go any

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.110 
but I do not think that I'm gonna go any
higher<00:00:53.399> than<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.839> so<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.610> what<00:00:59.820> why

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
higher than that so you know what why

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.820 
higher than that so you know what why
not<00:01:01.100> we'll<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> 1.5<00:01:03.180> eight<00:01:03.449> 125<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.320> that's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
not we'll go to 1.5 eight 125 and that's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.940 
not we'll go to 1.5 eight 125 and that's
as<00:01:05.159> far<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.610> we're<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.509> go<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.950> my

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
as far as we're going to go so my

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:28.870 
as far as we're going to go so my
multimeter<00:01:11.640> just

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.520 

what

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:42.840 

there<00:01:34.159> we<00:01:34.280> go<00:01:34.690> so<00:01:36.040> 1.58<00:01:37.930> I<00:01:39.010> got<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.130> set<00:01:40.430> at<00:01:41.229> 1.58

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
there we go so 1.58 I got it set at 1.58

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.370 
there we go so 1.58 I got it set at 1.58
125<00:01:43.850> volts<00:01:44.299> on<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.900> cpu<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.740> 1.40<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:48.110> the

Northbridge<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.390> we<00:01:50.390> will<00:01:50.630> try<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.930> prime<00:01:51.320> here

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
Northbridge and we will try a prime here

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:07.880 
Northbridge and we will try a prime here

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.960 

please<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:08.789> boil<00:02:09.210> up

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:25.400

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.990 

just<00:02:52.099> jumped<00:02:52.459> at<00:02:52.579> 1.6<00:02:53.450> for<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> second

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
just jumped at 1.6 for a second

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.170 
just jumped at 1.6 for a second

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.850 

and<00:03:07.019> we<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.409> gotta<00:03:07.650> stop

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.610 

alright<00:03:11.700> well<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.360> guess<00:03:12.960> that's<00:03:13.170> going<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> do

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
alright well I guess that's going to do

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.690 
alright well I guess that's going to do
it<00:03:13.770> for<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:14.100> chip

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.790 

and<00:03:20.060> lower<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.569> voltage<00:03:21.020> before<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.620> blows

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
and lower this voltage before it blows

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.820 
and lower this voltage before it blows
the<00:03:22.040> hell<00:03:22.220> up<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:25.510> 5<00:03:26.510> gigahertz<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.290> cannot<00:03:27.620> get

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
the hell up so 5 gigahertz I cannot get

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.400 
the hell up so 5 gigahertz I cannot get

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410

bolts<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.780> could<00:03:39.200> probably<00:03:39.349> get<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.620> little<00:03:39.830> bit

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
bolts I could probably get a little bit

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.050 
bolts I could probably get a little bit
lower<00:03:40.220> haven't<00:03:40.970> tried<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.209> yet<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:42.819> once<00:03:43.819> I

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
lower haven't tried it yet but once I

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.949 
lower haven't tried it yet but once I
increase<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.810> multiplier<00:03:45.519> 225<00:03:46.720> front<00:03:47.720> side

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
increase the multiplier 225 front side

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.470 
increase the multiplier 225 front side
bus<00:03:48.340> 200<00:03:49.340> megahertz<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.950> CPU<00:03:52.549> voltage<00:03:53.180> up

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
bus 200 megahertz and the CPU voltage up

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.910 
bus 200 megahertz and the CPU voltage up
to<00:03:54.670> 1.5<00:03:55.670> eight<00:03:56.090> 125<00:03:57.049> volts<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:59.620> could<00:04:00.620> not<00:04:00.769> get

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
to 1.5 eight 125 volts I could not get

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.990 
to 1.5 eight 125 volts I could not get
stable<00:04:01.430> so<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:06.650> there<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.010> for<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:07.430> chip<00:04:07.760> I

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
stable so so there it is for this chip I

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.800 
stable so so there it is for this chip I
think<00:04:08.450> that's<00:04:08.660> as<00:04:08.810> high<00:04:08.959> as<00:04:08.989> it's<00:04:09.319> going<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.530> go

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
think that's as high as it's going to go

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.890 
think that's as high as it's going to go
so<00:04:11.810> I<00:04:12.260> will<00:04:12.620> install<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.370> other<00:04:13.670> chip<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.360> we

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
so I will install this other chip and we

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.960 
so I will install this other chip and we
will<00:04:15.079> do<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.290> same<00:04:15.410> thing<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.190> see<00:04:16.400> if<00:04:16.549> we<00:04:16.729> can

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
will do the same thing and see if we can

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.800 
will do the same thing and see if we can
I<00:04:17.120> get<00:04:17.359> more<00:04:17.630> out<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.440> 8120<00:04:19.690> thanks<00:04:20.690> for

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
I get more out of the 8120 thanks for

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.229 
I get more out of the 8120 thanks for
watching
