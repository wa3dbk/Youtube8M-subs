little bit about the design sort of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.009 
little bit about the design sort of
thing<00:01:01.460> only<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.840> about

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.789 
make out on the video you can see just
how<00:01:07.200> small<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:08.250> bezel<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> screen<00:01:09.869> and

how small the bezel is on the screen and
as<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.430> below<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.200> basically

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
as you can see below the to basically

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.280 
as you can see below the to basically
stereo<00:01:14.610> speakers<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.240> integrated<00:01:15.900> into<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
stereo speakers are integrated into the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.670 
stereo speakers are integrated into the
stand<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.850> depth<00:01:18.150> wise<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.439> only

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
stand now the depth wise you only

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
stand now the depth wise you only
looking<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.460> inch<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.090> terms<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.600> depth

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
looking at about inch in terms of depth

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
looking at about inch in terms of depth
and<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.710> they've<00:01:22.950> done<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.189> good

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and I think they've done a really good

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 
and I think they've done a really good
job<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:24.000> integrating<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.960> than<00:01:25.259> actually

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
job of integrating this than actually

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
job of integrating this than actually
the<00:01:26.549> speakers<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.780> look<00:01:28.049> part<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.799> they

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the speakers do look part of it and they

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.160 
the speakers do look part of it and they
don't<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.430> stick<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:30.119> too<00:01:30.450> much<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.960> for

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
don't really stick out too much so for

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.380 
don't really stick out too much so for
those<00:01:31.320> who<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> worried<00:01:32.850> about<00:01:33.150> they

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
those who are kind of worried about they

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
those who are kind of worried about they
were<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.140> clunky<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.920> think

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
were going to be really clunky I think

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.469 
were going to be really clunky I think
you<00:01:35.250> don't<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> worry<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.329> think

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you don't have to worry at all i think

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
you don't have to worry at all i think
they've<00:01:36.930> done<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.229> good<00:01:37.619> job<00:01:37.680> ioc<00:01:38.549> now

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
they've done a really good job ioc now

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.410 
they've done a really good job ioc now
you<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> second<00:01:40.710> set<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.420> touchscreen

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you do get a second set of touchscreen

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
you do get a second set of touchscreen
controls<00:01:43.110> here<00:01:43.409> i<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:43.799> know<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> can

touch<00:01:57.270> sensitive<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> only<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
touch sensitive the only thing is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.770 
touch sensitive the only thing is
sometimes<00:01:59.100> i<00:01:59.729> found<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> touch

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
sometimes i found that the touch

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
sometimes i found that the touch
sensitivity<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.729> bit

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
sensitivity can be a little bit

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.510 
sensitivity can be a little bit
temperamental<00:02:03.630> sometimes<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.310> put

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
temperamental sometimes you have to put

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940 
temperamental sometimes you have to put
a<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:05.939> pressure<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:07.380> other<00:02:07.829> than

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
a bit more pressure on it but other than

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.260 
a bit more pressure on it but other than
that<00:02:08.099> i<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.459> hold<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.730> design

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that i think the the hold of the design

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.650 
that i think the the hold of the design
actually<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.959> he's<00:02:13.110> really

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
actually is that he's really

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
actually is that he's really
actually<00:02:14.020> I'm<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.470> show<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.710> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
actually I'm just going to show you the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.110 
actually I'm just going to show you the
side<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.750> screen<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.610> just<00:02:18.850> see

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
side of the screen you can just see

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.590 
side of the screen you can just see
there<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:20.590> not<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.160> thick<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.940> terms<00:02:22.270> of

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
there it's not that thick in terms of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.980 
there it's not that thick in terms of
obviously<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:24.760> terms<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.270> actual<00:02:25.420> screen

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
obviously in terms of the actual screen

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.310 
obviously in terms of the actual screen
itself<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.360> there's<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.840> would<00:02:29.080> say

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
itself and there's not I would say

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.350 
itself and there's not I would say
there's<00:02:29.560> not<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> master<00:02:30.400> Matt<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.820> moving<00:02:31.180> you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
there's not a master Matt of moving you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.060 
there's not a master Matt of moving you
can<00:02:31.570> do<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.840> can<00:02:31.870> obviously<00:02:32.260> tilt<00:02:32.860> it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
can do you can obviously tilt it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.980 
can do you can obviously tilt it
backwards<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.940> forwards<00:02:34.390> slide<00:02:34.630> there's<00:02:34.870> no

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
backwards and forwards slide there's no

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.410 
backwards and forwards slide there's no
vertical<00:02:35.500> or<00:02:35.860> kind<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.190> swivel<00:02:36.520> kind<00:02:37.330> of

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
vertical or kind of swivel kind of

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.870 
vertical or kind of swivel kind of
repositioning<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:39.070> that's<00:02:39.280> kind<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
repositioning so that's kind of a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.720 
repositioning so that's kind of a
downside<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.660> would<00:02:40.960> say<00:02:41.200> well<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.100> suppose<00:02:42.430> in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
downside I would say well I suppose in

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.270 
downside I would say well I suppose in
terms<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.270> connectivity<00:02:44.080> up<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:45.070> can

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
terms of the connectivity up you can

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.700 
terms of the connectivity up you can
just<00:02:45.550> make<00:02:45.790> her<00:02:46.030> hear<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.930> are<00:02:46.960> missing

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
just make her hear that you are missing

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.830 
just make her hear that you are missing
some<00:02:48.100> key<00:02:48.340> connectivity<00:02:49.180> options<00:02:49.330> for

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
some key connectivity options for

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.780 
some key connectivity options for
example<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.290> don't<00:02:50.560> have<00:02:50.710> a<00:02:50.740> DVI<00:02:51.250> connection

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
example you don't have a DVI connection

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.780 
example you don't have a DVI connection
and<00:02:52.210> neither<00:02:53.170> do<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.500> have<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:53.790> DisplayPort

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
and neither do you have a DisplayPort

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.440 
and neither do you have a DisplayPort
but<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.410> HDMI<00:02:57.250> which<00:02:57.520> also<00:02:57.760> allows

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
but you do get a HDMI which also allows

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.250 
but you do get a HDMI which also allows
you<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.990> plug<00:02:59.380> in<00:02:59.590> an<00:02:59.740> MHL<00:03:00.400> compatible<00:03:01.260> device

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
you to plug in an MHL compatible device

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.590 
you to plug in an MHL compatible device
such<00:03:02.620> as<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.980> an<00:03:03.130> Android<00:03:03.550> device<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.300> use<00:03:04.570> a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
such as like an Android device so use a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.040 
such as like an Android device so use a
basically<00:03:04.990> dual<00:03:05.320> function<00:03:05.830> hdmi<00:03:06.490> port<00:03:07.050> you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
basically dual function hdmi port you

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.890 
basically dual function hdmi port you
also<00:03:08.290> get<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.500> decent<00:03:08.770> connector<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.330> also<00:03:10.630> get

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
also get a decent connector you also get

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.740 
also get a decent connector you also get
that<00:03:11.140> line<00:03:11.440> lining<00:03:12.280> connection<00:03:13.000> it's

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
that line lining connection it's

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.480 
that line lining connection it's
obviously<00:03:14.080> if<00:03:14.260> you're<00:03:14.380> not<00:03:14.470> using<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.950> HTM

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
obviously if you're not using the HTM

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.420 
obviously if you're not using the HTM
are<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.760> can<00:03:15.910> still<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.300> sound<00:03:16.660> from<00:03:16.840> your

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
are you can still get sound from your

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.000 
are you can still get sound from your
computer<00:03:18.430> via<00:03:18.790> back<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.630> port<00:03:19.959> there<00:03:20.320> so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
computer via back on that port there so

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.890 
computer via back on that port there so
you<00:03:21.070> also<00:03:21.370> got<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.670> headphone<00:03:22.090> port<00:03:22.390> next<00:03:22.780> to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
you also got the headphone port next to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.500 
you also got the headphone port next to
it<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:23.709> meet<00:03:23.920> means<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.790> could<00:03:25.000> plug<00:03:25.330> in

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
it so it's meet means you could plug in

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.960 
it so it's meet means you could plug in
an<00:03:25.630> external<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:26.470> set<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.160> speakers<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.670> so

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
an external a set of speakers you so

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.780 
an external a set of speakers you so
desire<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.630> then<00:03:29.230> finally<00:03:29.830> you<00:03:29.860> do<00:03:30.160> get<00:03:30.459> the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
desire and then finally you do get the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.750 
desire and then finally you do get the
DC<00:03:31.540> connection<00:03:32.320> for<00:03:32.740> your<00:03:32.980> separate<00:03:33.490> power

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
DC connection for your separate power

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.720 
DC connection for your separate power
brick<00:03:34.440> however<00:03:35.440> though<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.830> misses<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.340> couple

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
that separate power brick so I think

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.100 
that separate power brick so I think
overall<00:04:43.340> really<00:04:43.730> this<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.480> I've<00:04:44.930> actually

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
overall really this is I've actually

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.830 
overall really this is I've actually
quite<00:04:45.440> enjoyed<00:04:45.770> using<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.400> screen<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:47.060> think

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
quite enjoyed using this screen I think

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.140 
quite enjoyed using this screen I think
the<00:04:47.960> screen<00:04:48.230> quality<00:04:48.590> for<00:04:49.130> games<00:04:49.400> or<00:04:49.730> windows

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
the screen quality for games or windows

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.740 
the screen quality for games or windows
use<00:04:50.510> is<00:04:50.690> really<00:04:51.050> good<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.850> also<00:04:52.850> think<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.510> the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
use is really good I also think that the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.410 
use is really good I also think that the
speaker<00:04:54.320> quality<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:55.130> definitely<00:04:55.730> a<00:04:55.760> mass

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
speaker quality is definitely a mass

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.930 
speaker quality is definitely a mass
improvement<00:04:57.170> over<00:04:57.380> some<00:04:57.680> of<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.860> monitors<00:04:58.790> of

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
improvement over some of the monitors of

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.120 
improvement over some of the monitors of
use<00:04:59.150> in<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.390> past<00:04:59.830> obviously<00:05:00.830> when<00:05:00.980> you're

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
use in the past obviously when you're

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.650 
use in the past obviously when you're
purchasing<00:05:01.670> it<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:02.000> need<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.180> take<00:05:02.480> in

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
purchasing it you need to take in

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.300 
purchasing it you need to take in
consideration<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.830> don't<00:05:04.100> get<00:05:04.280> a

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
consideration that you don't get a

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.940 
consideration that you don't get a
DisplayPort<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:06.080> don't<00:05:06.290> get<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.500> DVI

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
DisplayPort and you don't get a DVI

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.000 
DisplayPort and you don't get a DVI
connection<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.790> back<00:05:08.060> but<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.110> think<00:05:09.440> as

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
connection on the back but I think as

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.440 
connection on the back but I think as
what<00:05:10.220> are<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.460> only<00:05:10.580> other<00:05:10.790> thing<00:05:10.850> is<00:05:11.120> why<00:05:11.240> yes

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
what are the only other thing is why yes

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.820 
what are the only other thing is why yes
you<00:05:11.630> saw<00:05:11.810> you<00:05:11.870> don't<00:05:12.140> get<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.410> don't<00:05:12.440> get<00:05:12.740> any

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
you saw you don't get you don't get any

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.310 
you saw you don't get you don't get any
USB<00:05:13.160> ports<00:05:13.790> are<00:05:13.970> then<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.360> don't<00:05:14.540> get<00:05:14.720> much<00:05:14.990> in

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
USB ports are then you don't get much in

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.440 
USB ports are then you don't get much in
the<00:05:15.530> way<00:05:15.560> of<00:05:15.760> vertical<00:05:16.760> or<00:05:17.000> kind<00:05:17.360> of

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
the way of vertical or kind of

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.050 
the way of vertical or kind of
horizontal<00:05:18.410> adjustment<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.700> don't<00:05:19.940> get

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
horizontal adjustment and you don't get

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.900 
horizontal adjustment and you don't get
that<00:05:20.120> swivel<00:05:20.690> function<00:05:21.230> but<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.400> think<00:05:22.790> you'll

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
that swivel function but I think you'll

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.670 
that swivel function but I think you'll
be<00:05:23.000> just<00:05:23.030> looking<00:05:23.510> for<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.720> monitor<00:05:24.200> that's<00:05:24.470> got
