00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.050 

and<00:00:00.120> this<00:00:00.750> science<00:00:01.260> off<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.620> sphere<00:00:02.060> involves

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
and this science off the sphere involves

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.269 
and this science off the sphere involves
filling<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.510> balloon<00:00:03.659> up<00:00:04.170> with<00:00:04.799> water<00:00:05.069> and

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
filling a balloon up with water and

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.299 
filling a balloon up with water and
popping<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.509> what<00:00:06.720> happens<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:08.099> a

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
popping it and what happens to it in a

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
popping it and what happens to it in a
weightless<00:00:08.550> environment<00:00:09.139> we're<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.320> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
weightless environment we're going to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.430 
weightless environment we're going to
see<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.710> many<00:00:10.980> times<00:00:11.400> during<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.630> short

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
see this many times during this short

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.599 
see this many times during this short
video<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:15.650> we'll<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:17.010> able<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> look<00:00:17.430> at

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
video so so we'll be able to look at

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.490 
video so so we'll be able to look at
some<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> physics<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.900> there's<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> balloon

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
some of the physics so there's a balloon

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.950 
some of the physics so there's a balloon
and<00:00:19.980> I've<00:00:20.760> got<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> little<00:00:21.150> needle<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.720> pop

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
and I've got a little needle and you pop

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.550 
and I've got a little needle and you pop
it<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.580> you<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.789> watch<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.170> observe

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
it and you can watch the you can observe

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
it and you can watch the you can observe
the<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:27.840> behavior<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.650> water<00:00:29.000> without

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the the behavior of the water without

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.600 
the the behavior of the water without
having<00:00:30.800> gravitational<00:00:31.800> effects<00:00:32.160> make<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
having gravitational effects make it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.870 
having gravitational effects make it
just<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.000> fall<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> floor<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.760> we

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
just a fall to the floor so here here we

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.010 
just a fall to the floor so here here we
go<00:00:36.000> again<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.800> pop<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.280> same<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.450> skin

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
go again and you pop this same the skin

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
go again and you pop this same the skin
disappears<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:41.010> quick<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> you're<00:00:41.940> left

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
disappears really quick and you're left

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
disappears really quick and you're left
with<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> pseudo<00:00:43.320> sphere<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> water<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
with a pseudo sphere of water that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
with a pseudo sphere of water that
ungulates<00:00:44.760> around<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.239> little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
ungulates around a little bit and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
ungulates around a little bit and
eventually<00:00:46.050> surface<00:00:46.770> tension<00:00:47.129> forces<00:00:47.460> will

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
eventually surface tension forces will

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.069 
eventually surface tension forces will
convert<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> sphere<00:00:50.030> or<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
convert it into a sphere or no this is a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.860 
convert it into a sphere or no this is a
slow<00:00:52.649> motion<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.340> watch<00:00:53.820> closely<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> goes

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
slow motion so watch closely so it goes

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.500 
slow motion so watch closely so it goes
pop<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.949> skin<00:00:56.219> disappears<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:57.149> really

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
pop the skin disappears really really

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.830 
pop the skin disappears really really
quickly<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.219> then<00:00:59.270> to<00:01:00.270> shockwaves<00:01:00.899> form<00:01:02.000> as<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
quickly and then to shockwaves form as a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
quickly and then to shockwaves form as a
result<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.949> rubber<00:01:05.250> skin<00:01:05.610> peeling

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
result of this the rubber skin peeling

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510 
result of this the rubber skin peeling
away<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> they're<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.560> opposite<00:01:08.040> ends<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
away and they're on opposite ends of the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.710 
away and they're on opposite ends of the
balloon<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:10.880> they<00:01:11.880> come<00:01:12.090> together<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
balloon and they come together in the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840 
balloon and they come together in the
middle<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> make<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> squeeze<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:14.820> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
middle and make it squeeze out kind of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.190 
middle and make it squeeze out kind of
like<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> pancake<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:19.020> after

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
like a pancake and this and then after

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.940 
like a pancake and this and then after
that<00:01:19.470> surface<00:01:19.950> tension<00:01:20.310> forces<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:21.950> make

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that surface tension forces will make

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.850 
that surface tension forces will make
the<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.700> resultant<00:01:24.119> water<00:01:24.330> pull<00:01:25.110> together<00:01:25.290> in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the the resultant water pull together in

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
the the resultant water pull together in
an<00:01:26.040> undulating<00:01:26.369> mass<00:01:26.880> until<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> eventually

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
an undulating mass until it eventually

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.819 
an undulating mass until it eventually
forms<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> nice<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.770> pretty<00:01:29.100> sphere<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> again

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
forms a nice a pretty sphere so again

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.480 
forms a nice a pretty sphere so again
here's<00:01:32.310> here's<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> balloon<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.720> gets<00:01:33.960> popped

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
here's here's a balloon it gets popped

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.730 
here's here's a balloon it gets popped
notice<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.210> rubber<00:01:36.450> peels<00:01:36.869> away<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.590> you're

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
notice the rubber peels away and you're

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.069 
notice the rubber peels away and you're
left<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.280> water<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> shape<00:01:39.780> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
left with this water in the shape of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.350 
left with this water in the shape of
what<00:01:40.290> used<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.950> balloon<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.610> then

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
what used to be the balloon and then

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.910 
what used to be the balloon and then
here<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> two<00:01:43.350> shockwaves

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
here you can see the two shockwaves

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240 
here you can see the two shockwaves
moving<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.729> towards<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> center<00:01:46.250> squeezing

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
moving in towards the center squeezing

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.969 
moving in towards the center squeezing
the<00:01:47.340> water<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.479> pancake<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.200> structure

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the water into a pancake like structure

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.020 
the water into a pancake like structure
and<00:01:50.130> then<00:01:50.700> surface<00:01:51.390> tension<00:01:51.810> forces<00:01:52.170> will

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and then surface tension forces will

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.350 
and then surface tension forces will
will<00:01:54.350> pull<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.159> pancake<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.000> make<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
will pull on that pancake and make it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.959 
will pull on that pancake and make it
into<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> potato<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.549> potato

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
into a potato and then that potato

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
into a potato and then that potato
oscillates<00:02:00.540> around<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.110> eventually<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.649> end

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
oscillates around and eventually you end

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.539 
oscillates around and eventually you end
up<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> nice<00:02:02.340> pretty<00:02:02.579> sphere

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.639 

and<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> course<00:02:06.359> you<00:02:06.659> can't<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.229> too<00:02:07.439> many

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and of course you can't do this too many

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.919 
and of course you can't do this too many
times<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.310> mean<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.789> really<00:02:09.509> neat<00:02:09.720> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
times I mean this is really neat so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.740 
times I mean this is really neat so
here's<00:02:10.170> here's<00:02:10.649> yet<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.280> more<00:02:11.519> example<00:02:12.420> of

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
here's here's yet one more example of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.350 
here's here's yet one more example of
what<00:02:12.959> happens<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:14.489> each<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.090> little

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
what happens and each one is a little

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.369 
what happens and each one is a little
different<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:17.480> again<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> skin<00:02:18.900> peels<00:02:19.200> away

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
different and again the skin peels away

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.460 
different and again the skin peels away
really<00:02:19.980> quickly<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.610> you're<00:02:21.120> left<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:22.140> this

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
really quickly and you're left with this

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.920 
really quickly and you're left with this
a<00:02:23.959> unsupported<00:02:25.220> shape<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.430> water<00:02:26.700> which<00:02:27.599> on

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
a unsupported shape of water which on

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.750 
a unsupported shape of water which on
earth<00:02:28.319> would<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.890> fall<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.459> ground

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
earth would just fall to the ground

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.789 
earth would just fall to the ground
under<00:02:30.090> gravitational<00:02:30.840> forces<00:02:31.140> really

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
under gravitational forces really

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.000 
under gravitational forces really
quickly<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:33.120> won't<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.900> able<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.110> see<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
quickly and you won't be able to see the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.059 
quickly and you won't be able to see the
resultant<00:02:35.459> behavior

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
resultant behavior

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.949 
resultant behavior
now<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.130> balloons<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.790> had<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:39.569> were

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
now the balloons that I had here were

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.460 
now the balloons that I had here were
kind<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.459> oval<00:02:41.459> shaped<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:42.480> oblong<00:02:42.840> well<00:02:43.380> I

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
kind of oval shaped or oblong well I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.740 
kind of oval shaped or oblong well I
found<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.579> was<00:02:44.730> more<00:02:44.940> spherical<00:02:45.390> so

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
found one that was more spherical so

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.300 
found one that was more spherical so
let's<00:02:45.930> look<00:02:46.110> what<00:02:46.260> happens<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:46.860> with

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
let's look what happens with a with

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.309 
let's look what happens with a with
something<00:02:47.519> that's<00:02:47.760> close<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.209> sphere<00:02:48.750> when

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
something that's close to a sphere when

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.350 
something that's close to a sphere when
the<00:02:49.650> rubber<00:02:49.829> balloon<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.430> removed<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.120> here

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
the rubber balloon is removed so here

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.750 
the rubber balloon is removed so here
goes<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> again<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.660> skin<00:02:54.900> peels<00:02:55.110> away<00:02:55.760> you're

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
goes so again the skin peels away you're

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.880 
goes so again the skin peels away you're
left<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.390> close<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.440> sphere<00:02:58.860> of

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
left with this close to a sphere of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.190 
left with this close to a sphere of
water<00:02:59.269> unsupported<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:00.630> some<00:03:00.840> ripples

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
water unsupported you see some ripples

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.619 
water unsupported you see some ripples
on<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.380> surface<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.310> now<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.269> see<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
on the surface and now you can see the

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.369 
on the surface and now you can see the
two<00:03:03.780> shockwaves<00:03:04.440> coming<00:03:05.190> together<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.690> and

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
two shockwaves coming together and and

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.440 
two shockwaves coming together and and
squeezing<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:07.890> into<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.190> pancake<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.299> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
squeezing it into a pancake and this is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.750 
squeezing it into a pancake and this is
a<00:03:09.630> really<00:03:10.139> interesting<00:03:10.590> example<00:03:11.370> where<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
a really interesting example where a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.440 
a really interesting example where a
single<00:03:12.269> point<00:03:12.560> initiated<00:03:13.560> shockwave<00:03:14.450> will

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
single point initiated shockwave will

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.490 
single point initiated shockwave will
end<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:16.019> making<00:03:17.389> two<00:03:18.389> adjacent<00:03:18.840> shock<00:03:19.260> waves

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
end up making two adjacent shock waves

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.220 
end up making two adjacent shock waves
coming<00:03:20.069> together<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.630> middle<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
coming together in the middle and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.349 
coming together in the middle and
squeezing<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.859> into<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> pancake<00:03:23.519> oh<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
squeezing this into a pancake oh and

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.140 
squeezing this into a pancake oh and
watch<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.989> if<00:03:25.290> formed<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:25.799> long<00:03:26.100> column<00:03:26.910> of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
watch this if formed this long column of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.970 
watch this if formed this long column of
water<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.290> Rayleigh<00:03:28.650> instability

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
water and then the Rayleigh instability

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.580 
water and then the Rayleigh instability
comes<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.120> breaks<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.569> up<00:03:30.750> if<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.440> have<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
comes and breaks it up if you have a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.920 
comes and breaks it up if you have a
column<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.130> water<00:03:32.310> greater<00:03:33.120> than<00:03:33.359> pi<00:03:33.600> times

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
column of water greater than pi times

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.500 
column of water greater than pi times
the<00:03:34.170> diameter<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:35.190> becomes<00:03:35.670> unstable<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.329> it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
the diameter it becomes unstable and it

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.349 
the diameter it becomes unstable and it
breaks<00:03:36.720> up<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.769> here's<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.459> final<00:03:38.639> one<00:03:38.970> shown

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
breaks up so here's the final one shown

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.860 
breaks up so here's the final one shown
in<00:03:39.389> real<00:03:39.900> speed<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:41.400> want<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.389> end<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:42.810> by

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
in real speed and I want to end this by

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.800 
in real speed and I want to end this by
saying<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.410> we<00:03:44.010> did<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.430> these<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:45.060> our

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
saying that we did all of these in our

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.620 
saying that we did all of these in our
hygiene<00:03:46.349> area<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.819> had<00:03:48.060> plenty<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.419> towels

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
hygiene area and we had plenty of towels

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.740 
hygiene area and we had plenty of towels
around<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.410> see<00:03:49.620> after<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.669> release<00:03:51.510> one

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
around you can see after you release one

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.900 
around you can see after you release one
of<00:03:51.840> these<00:03:51.959> spheres<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.769> can<00:03:53.400> easily<00:03:53.700> capture

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
of these spheres you can easily capture

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.180 
of these spheres you can easily capture
that<00:03:54.269> in<00:03:54.419> a<00:03:54.510> towel<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.109> now<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.680> have<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:55.950> wet

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that in a towel and now you have a wet

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.309 
that in a towel and now you have a wet
towel<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.299> use<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:58.019> towel<00:03:59.480> for<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.840> tape

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
towel you can use this towel for a tape

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.050 
towel you can use this towel for a tape
for<00:04:01.799> your<00:04:01.889> hygiene<00:04:02.310> break<00:04:02.519> where<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.790> do<00:04:02.940> your
