an upcycled video which I'll link down

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.880 
an upcycled video which I'll link down
below<00:00:19.239> but<00:00:19.419> basically<00:00:20.020> they<00:00:20.259> are<00:00:20.290> just<00:00:20.739> a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
below but basically they are just a

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.710 
below but basically they are just a
t-shirt<00:00:21.310> that<00:00:21.340> has<00:00:21.669> been<00:00:21.820> reworked<00:00:22.060> into<00:00:22.689> a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
t-shirt that has been reworked into a

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.229 
t-shirt that has been reworked into a
dress<00:00:23.110> and<00:00:23.410> it's<00:00:24.070> just<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.430> really<00:00:24.700> cute<00:00:24.939> fun

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
dress and it's just a really cute fun

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.510 
dress and it's just a really cute fun
style<00:00:25.570> that<00:00:26.200> I<00:00:26.230> think<00:00:26.800> is<00:00:26.950> an<00:00:27.070> acquired<00:00:27.369> taste

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
style that I think is an acquired taste

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.370 
style that I think is an acquired taste
because<00:00:28.029> I<00:00:28.059> didn't<00:00:28.450> originally<00:00:28.960> like<00:00:29.169> these

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
because I didn't originally like these

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.740 
because I didn't originally like these
when<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:29.680> started<00:00:30.070> buying<00:00:30.220> customs<00:00:30.759> but<00:00:31.390> once

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
when we started buying customs but once

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.600 
when we started buying customs but once
I've<00:00:32.020> seen<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.410> girls<00:00:32.529> in<00:00:32.860> them<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.340> they

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
I've seen the girls in them and they

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.520 
I've seen the girls in them and they
think<00:00:34.120> that<00:00:34.180> they're<00:00:34.390> super<00:00:34.570> comfortable<00:00:35.230> and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
think that they're super comfortable and

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.200 
think that they're super comfortable and
this<00:00:36.010> may<00:00:36.250> be<00:00:36.280> what<00:00:36.670> we<00:00:36.790> start<00:00:37.030> gravitating

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
this may be what we start gravitating

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.030 
this may be what we start gravitating
towards<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.290> I'm<00:00:38.500> going<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.710> try<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:38.860> go

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
towards so I'm going to try to go

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
towards so I'm going to try to go
through<00:00:39.070> this<00:00:39.310> as<00:00:39.490> quickly<00:00:39.550> as<00:00:39.940> possible

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
through this as quickly as possible

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.570 
through this as quickly as possible
there's<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.140> lot<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.470> used<00:00:41.800> ones<00:00:42.070> in<00:00:42.280> here

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
there's a lot of used ones in here

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.160 
there's a lot of used ones in here
because<00:00:43.030> we<00:00:43.180> were<00:00:43.270> just<00:00:43.450> trying<00:00:43.720> not<00:00:43.930> used

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170

so<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:51.040> need<00:02:51.489> more<00:02:51.730> for<00:02:52.000> Natalie<00:02:52.450> more<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.989> and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
so I need more for Natalie more so and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.589 
so I need more for Natalie more so and
then<00:02:53.859> this<00:02:54.099> is<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> really<00:02:54.609> cute<00:02:54.970> Rapunzel<00:02:55.450> one

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
then this is a really cute Rapunzel one

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.210 
then this is a really cute Rapunzel one
but<00:02:55.810> again<00:02:56.049> it's<00:02:56.260> not<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.680> size<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.920> I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
but again it's not the size that I

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.699 
but again it's not the size that I
thought<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.579> was<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.030> be<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:59.109> those<00:02:59.349> two

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
thought it was going to be so those two

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.000 
thought it was going to be so those two
may<00:03:00.040> actually<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.640> go<00:03:00.790> back<00:03:00.970> out<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:01.420> anyhow

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
may actually just go back out but anyhow

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.680 
may actually just go back out but anyhow
Natalie<00:03:03.010> really<00:03:03.159> likes<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.700> one<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.299> I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
Natalie really likes this one and I

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.390 
Natalie really likes this one and I
think<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.079> Bella<00:03:05.349> definitely<00:03:05.950> has<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.099> bunch

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
think that Bella definitely has a bunch

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.170 
think that Bella definitely has a bunch
of<00:03:06.519> cute<00:03:06.730> ones

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
of cute ones
