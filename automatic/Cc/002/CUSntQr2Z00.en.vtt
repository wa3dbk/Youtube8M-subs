00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
via implementation out doesn't quite use

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.430 
via implementation out doesn't quite use
tags<00:00:58.970> because<00:00:59.180> our<00:00:59.390> little<00:00:59.629> non-standard<00:01:00.199> but

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
tags because our little non-standard but

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.229 
tags because our little non-standard but
we<00:01:00.530> do<00:01:00.680> directories<00:01:01.250> for<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.610> for<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.030> venue

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239

but<00:01:02.870> we<00:01:02.989> do<00:01:03.110> use<00:01:03.140> metadata<00:01:03.739> in<00:01:03.920> other<00:01:04.070> in<00:01:04.729> other

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
but we do use metadata in other in other

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.300 
but we do use metadata in other in other
features<00:01:05.510> which<00:01:05.690> I<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.650> limit<00:01:06.860> my<00:01:07.010> demo

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
features which I have to limit my demo

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.830 
features which I have to limit my demo
but<00:01:07.490> yeah<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:07.820> can<00:01:08.000> use<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.210> photo<00:01:08.390> metadata

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
but yeah we can use the photo metadata

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.270 
but yeah we can use the photo metadata
to<00:01:09.110> categorize<00:01:09.979> things<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:11.979> then<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.100> can

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
to categorize things and then you can

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.200 
to categorize things and then you can
transfer<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.149> into<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.800> grid<00:01:15.800> view<00:01:16.009> we<00:01:16.880> found<00:01:17.119> a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
transfer it into a grid view we found a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.580 
transfer it into a grid view we found a
she<00:01:17.300> i<00:01:17.360> was<00:01:17.540> i<00:01:17.660> was<00:01:17.780> always<00:01:17.960> saying<00:01:18.170> well<00:01:18.320> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
different different groups in the grid

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.320 
different different groups in the grid
and<00:01:30.080> we<00:01:31.070> scale<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.520> as<00:01:31.580> many<00:01:31.670> photos<00:01:31.970> as<00:01:32.090> you

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
and we scale to as many photos as you

can<00:01:32.450> throw<00:01:32.600> at<00:01:32.780> us<00:01:32.810> basically<00:01:33.350> build<00:01:34.310> and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
can throw at us basically build and

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.400 
can throw at us basically build and
expand<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:34.940> most<00:01:35.090> expands<00:01:35.420> Berkeley's<00:01:36.170> loans

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
expand in most expands Berkeley's loans
