00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
man can you can you give us a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.359 
man can you can you give us a
demonstration<00:00:14.160> motion<00:00:15.000> yeah<00:00:18.140> I'll<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.350> ready

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.640 

so<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:23.880> gonna<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.359> zoom<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
so what I'm gonna do is zoom out and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.490 
so what I'm gonna do is zoom out and
zooming<00:00:26.130> first<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.119> repeated<00:00:28.019> two

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
zooming first and then repeated two

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
zooming first and then repeated two
times

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.750 

so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.410 

this<00:00:42.760> technology<00:00:43.420> is<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.980> placed<00:00:45.280> here<00:00:45.910> where

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
this technology is not placed here where

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.250 
this technology is not placed here where
it's<00:00:47.050> it's<00:00:47.530> in<00:00:47.680> progress<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.900> whole

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
it's it's in progress and the whole

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.140 
it's it's in progress and the whole
version<00:00:50.710> would<00:00:50.890> be<00:00:50.950> coming<00:00:51.250> out<00:00:51.490> sometime

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
version would be coming out sometime

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.010 
version would be coming out sometime
this<00:00:52.330> year<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:54.330> we<00:00:55.330> are<00:00:55.420> really<00:00:55.510> working<00:00:55.690> on

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
this year so we are really working on

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.050 
this year so we are really working on
that<00:00:56.080> right<00:00:56.440> now<00:00:56.500> and<00:00:56.770> then<00:00:57.100> maybe<00:00:57.370> next<00:00:57.760> words

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060

that right now and then maybe next words
you<00:00:58.210> would<00:00:58.390> be<00:00:59.730> Angus<00:01:00.730> yours<00:01:01.030> for<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.950> for<00:01:02.950> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you would be Angus yours for the for the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.310 
you would be Angus yours for the for the
sidebars<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:07.590> yeah<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:08.620> think<00:01:08.830> that's<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:10.320> okay

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
have here is the second part of the same

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.490 
have here is the second part of the same
technology<00:01:17.500> using<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.920> webcam<00:01:18.190> sensing<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
technology using the webcam sensing so

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.290 
technology using the webcam sensing so
right<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:20.979> what<00:01:21.430> we<00:01:21.580> are<00:01:21.610> going<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.820> try<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.060> do

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
right now what we are going to try to do

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.510 
right now what we are going to try to do
is<00:01:22.510> we<00:01:22.720> are<00:01:23.140> going<00:01:23.260> to<00:01:23.470> scroll<00:01:23.740> down<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:24.310> then

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
is we are going to scroll down and then

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.020 
is we are going to scroll down and then
scroll<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.900> using<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.680> webcam<00:01:26.830> sensing<00:01:27.430> so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
scroll up using the webcam sensing so

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.570 
scroll up using the webcam sensing so
they're<00:01:28.270> going<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.540> go<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.720> quick<00:01:29.170> down<00:01:30.720> slow

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
they're going to go a quick down slow

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.240 
they're going to go a quick down slow
click<00:01:33.580> down<00:01:35.070> quick<00:01:36.070> up<00:01:37.470> okay<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.680> then<00:01:38.979> I'm

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
click down quick up okay and then I'm

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.940 
click down quick up okay and then I'm
gonna<00:01:39.400> learn<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.090> do<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.300> slow<00:01:40.600> down<00:01:41.460> slow<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
gonna learn to do is slow down slow and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
that's the second part of the same

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.970 
that's the second part of the same
technology<00:01:54.340> basically<00:01:54.550> and
