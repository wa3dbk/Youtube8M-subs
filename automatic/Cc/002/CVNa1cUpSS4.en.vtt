00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 bio people is saying I hope it 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 okay so today we end up 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 to lead dating pack number 2 you 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.429
 are going to have a ton of small files 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.530
 which represents ganda animations there 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.710
 in 40 years all so there is a little 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.990
 near all the list hop here cries I 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.300
 only know 40 elements so here it is 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 be aware that it's not me who has them 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.130
 did I find them the pack on youtube 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 but it was actually they were all at 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.250
 following on a very long video with 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.260
 full there are plenty that are useless 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.290
 between us I have made you the sort of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.640
 all this and I put them in a pack 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.530
 john trap south start using 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.030
 because in fact they are all on bottom 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.870
 green 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.100
 I could have put them on bottom 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.540
 black but I thought it would be 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 it's better to keep them on his glass 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.530
 and I 'm just going to show you the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 technique so you're going to place them on 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.190
 a video track above your clip 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.600
 to combine a clip on rails but we 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.399
 not see yet because she worms by 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.129
 on top of it to remove the green you 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 go to a street station in chrome a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.570
 solid license and this effect allows for 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 to do green screen I'm passionate 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.949
 it's this term and this notion but I 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.299
 shows you this sequel you are 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.600
 that it is done by default and you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.240
 apply it on the tac track so that's it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.430
 makes a weird setting like that you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 go in color you scroll 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.869
 uncheck the application like this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.090
 it does not apply you click on the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 pipette and you select the color 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.509
 green and watch that will detect it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.900
 automatically it's this one 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.790
 then you re activate the facts had to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.350
 close that you put in propulsion 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.010
 complete to see the details 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.530
 and there you go a little down 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.550
 increase the pressure saw up we see 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.120
 that he is happy or become more 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.430
 blue night 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.500
 it's worth the pc a bit and you settle quickly 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.230
 does the details you see that if you 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.940
 touch that it takes a little bit more 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.330
 outline 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.580
 tired of the crazy but not used in the show 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.400
 so here it is that will allow you 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.920
 from matur and every year to the east by 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.450
 above all the animations if you 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.330
 want a little more style you can 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.330
 put the track between different things 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.210
 gives even more effects to us 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.910
 do not say that kind fire to sign it so 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.290
 here you have all of you have all 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.050
 the small the small animations I 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.980
 used in my furious editor and no 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.800
 not bad in addition so here I hope that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.640
 this pack will help you a lot and tells you 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.640
 next year
