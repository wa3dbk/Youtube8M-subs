00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.309
 or guys trying my youtube 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.290
 name is to fight and scales and good 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.880
 guys because today I have a new video that 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.220
 is about a way that the truth is one of 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.529
 the best ways and is that it could be the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.029
 best way is almost almost for what it is 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.439
 minecraft but good is not a mode 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.329
 aesthetics is not a way that modifies 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.640
 things is simply a help may 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.570
 to say it this way 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.850
 and well then let's see what it is 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.480
 it is simply this is like having a 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.790
 creative mode but 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 with more good options let's see what 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 I mean with this we are going to press the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.970
 button x can manually be button with 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.739
 the one that we're going to open our - of objects 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.410
 and all this and we'll see what appears 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.870
 this window to start we can 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 hide with or remove the put 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.960
 depending on what you want 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.110
 this mode has and has the good name 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 has a name we do not have to see 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.450
 let him quickly find his name in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 general is the nou 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.539
 I noticed in audi times that good 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 generally the pure mod is this but 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.640
 almost always in the pages they put another 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.750
 additional mode that is that I would travel 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.270
 here the discussion of the video that is that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.039
 so we 're just going to a capture 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.899
 let's see how things are loaded 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.399
 example but good but let's talk about 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.350
 the first thing is this because 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.869
 interface that we have we have to give us 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.550
 these options and good the options that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.649
 we have here are obvious always had 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.229
 if we press this button we do day 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.420
 if we press the button we do this 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.700
 noon if we press these buttons 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.870
 Well, it's obvious that we 're not going to stop 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.560
 this way we can 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.660
 here the creative way survival adventure 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.060
 we can put here we can rain 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.950
 we can do delete things once it's 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.770
 that we do not want to have things from a 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.420
 way so fast and simple that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.550
 good this furniture are the best 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
 for how I'm doing right now 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.880
 same to be giving reviews of mod 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.960
 we can also save our 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.820
 articles 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.490
 so an example let's say let's go 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.790
 a mission we put our objects like this 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.910
 and we give it in save ok we go to a mine 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.350
 We do not die, I do not know how they say 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.970
 when they kill us and we give him here they can 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.160
 see that they load our things and it's 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.690
 just in case we want to have then 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.840
 equipment already pre-finished and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.130
 saved and good in this would be this here 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.290
 simply because as in other things 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.300
 Well, an easier and practical way 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.010
 besides that it gives us all the things of 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.650
 any way if we have anything 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.050
 it appears here and good and the other way 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.820
 what it does is that combined with this 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.890
 way we position an example we do not know 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.260
 how to make a chest press on 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.599
 the coffe the coffe law on the chest 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.519
 r and give us how you sucre how to 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.290
 it grows in a super super simple way 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.150
 and simple an apology by the parish priest 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.069
 It's sounding but you know that sometimes 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.420
 you can not shut up we have the framework and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.099
 likewise you do not do what you can 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.989
 simply make things that do not 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.730
 can be done as I think the seven 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.430
 horse that can not be done 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.340
 obviously it does not tell us how it is done but 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.080
 you need one I see to see 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.660
 for example this the bucket with lava 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.580
 obviously we can not do it but 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.260
 can see that the forest gives very very well 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.180
 if we want to do this to get things out 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.040
 how do I usually get the use 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.170
 to know how this was created and why 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.170
 good if we solve the key then 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.549
 of right selection we can drag 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.200
 anything we want and we give 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.750
 with the left button then throw the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.120
 64 and we can get anything out of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.459
 this menu does not matter no matter what 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.739
 mode of you in what game 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.620
 you're just going to work or be 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.260
 Anyway and I repeat to myself I love this 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.510
 way to see the searches and to make them 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.670
 wash reviews and I know that many 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.140
 You will love this mode because 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.819
 personal me when I looked for the first 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.799
 I could not find it because the truth 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.690
 It has a rather complicated name if 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.280
 is that we are speaking Spanish so 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.140
 I will try to put it with a name 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.989
 quite pretty simple as always 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.049
 which is for version 1.7 point 2 and 1 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.690
 point 6.4 is comfort and best of all 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.760
 which is comfort and you can simply 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.500
 I leave the links here below you know 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.239
 you simply give it download download 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.070
 the modes or just the page what 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.290
 is saying that it is very easy simply 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.660
 passes your wallet 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.400
 and we have it installed, of course it depends 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.050
 because your version I 'm going to put you here 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.260
 down I'm going to put you down here 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.730
 two links for the 1.6 point 41.7 point 2 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.440
 I had already told him, you just give him 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.780
 click and the downloads and autocarpe we have 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.760
