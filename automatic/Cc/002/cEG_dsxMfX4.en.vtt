update<00:00:28.439> should<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.699> fix<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.510> was

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
update should be out to fix that it was

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
update should be out to fix that it was
still<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> 37<00:00:31.410> megabyte<00:00:31.619> opted<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.189> 5s

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
still a 37 megabyte opted for that 5s

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.610 
still a 37 megabyte opted for that 5s
and<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:32.969> 70<00:00:33.329> megabytes<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.930> after<00:00:34.140> five<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and like 70 megabytes but after five and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.080 
and like 70 megabytes but after five and
I<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.850> probably

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
I think it was a little bit probably

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.880 
I think it was a little bit probably
maybe<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.630> bit<00:00:36.780> lower<00:00:36.930> than<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.260> only

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
maybe a little bit lower than that only

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.959 
maybe a little bit lower than that only
4s<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> iPhone<00:00:39.300> 4<00:00:40.070> which<00:00:41.070> could<00:00:41.489> be

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
4s but on the iPhone 4 which could be

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
4s but on the iPhone 4 which could be
interesting<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.840> know<00:00:42.870> could<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:43.860> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
interesting to know could be because of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.130 
interesting to know could be because of
a<00:00:44.160> high<00:00:44.340> resolution<00:00:44.670> display<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.960> new

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
a high resolution display or the new

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
a high resolution display or the new
hardware<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> new<00:00:47.010> iPhones<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.579> makes

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
hardware in the new iPhones that makes

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
hardware in the new iPhones that makes
it<00:00:47.910> bigger<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.410> still<00:00:49.649> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it bigger and to see if you still have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.520 
it bigger and to see if you still have
the<00:00:49.860> lag<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.510> yes<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.899> kind<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.440> an

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the lag here yes it's kind of like an

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.900 
the lag here yes it's kind of like an
extreme<00:00:52.800> lag<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.280> should<00:00:53.399> happen<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> fix

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
extreme lag they should happen to fix

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
extreme lag they should happen to fix
that<00:00:54.120> each<00:00:54.329> time<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> boot<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.230> device

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that each time you boot up the device

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.770 
that each time you boot up the device
you<00:00:56.219> always<00:00:56.430> gotta<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you always gotta get that you see the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that they'll be tweaking around in some

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
that they'll be tweaking around in some
kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> app<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.259> definitely

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
kind of app and then you can definitely

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
kind of app and then you can definitely
let<00:01:29.460> me<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.610> about<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.530> phone

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
let me know about that and this phone

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.880 
let me know about that and this phone
definite<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> way<00:01:32.610> better<00:01:32.939> performance

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
definite has a way better performance

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
definite has a way better performance
overall<00:01:34.890> across<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> system<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.390> would

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
overall across the system then I would

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.080 
overall across the system then I would
serve<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> iPhone<00:01:37.619> 4<00:01:38.220> which

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
serve it on the iPhone 4 which

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.149 
serve it on the iPhone 4 which
definitely<00:01:39.450> isn't<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.530> weird<00:01:41.009> because

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
definitely isn't really weird because

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.030 
definitely isn't really weird because
this<00:01:42.000> phone<00:01:42.210> actually<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.170> having<00:01:43.649> an<00:01:43.740> extra

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
this phone actually is having an extra

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
this phone actually is having an extra
core<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.020> making<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
core and that is really really making a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.480 
core and that is really really making a
difference<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.790> iPhone<00:01:47.939> 4<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.680> having<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
difference so the iPhone 4 is having a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
difference so the iPhone 4 is having a
single<00:01:50.729> core<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.229> having

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
single core and what this one is having

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.270 
single core and what this one is having
the<00:01:52.860> two<00:01:53.070> cores<00:01:54.170> which<00:01:55.170> could<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.649> good<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the two cores which could be good to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.660 
the two cores which could be good to
know<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.070> should<00:01:59.130> effin<00:01:59.369> fix

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
know you see here this should effin fix

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
know you see here this should effin fix
it<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.600> 7<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.009> close<00:02:02.280> all

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it in I was 7 and that you can close all

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880 
it in I was 7 and that you can close all
apps<00:02:02.880> instantly<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.259> would<00:02:04.409> definitely<00:02:04.560> be

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
apps instantly that would definitely be

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.990 
apps instantly that would definitely be
nice

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
nice

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
nice

are<00:04:04.739> bugs<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.819> also<00:04:05.849> put<00:04:06.239> up<00:04:06.389> at

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
are bugs like that and I also put up at

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.470 
are bugs like that and I also put up at
four<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.230> if<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.370> worry<00:04:08.730> about<00:04:08.760> job<00:04:09.269> break

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
four and if you worry about job break

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.750 
four and if you worry about job break
maybe<00:04:10.049> older<00:04:10.470> studies<00:04:10.769> as<00:04:10.889> well<00:04:11.069> but<00:04:11.250> if<00:04:11.579> you

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
maybe older studies as well but if you

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.599 
maybe older studies as well but if you
were<00:04:12.090> about<00:04:12.419> jailbreak<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.340> won't<00:04:14.519> be

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
were about jailbreak that you won't be

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.069 
were about jailbreak that you won't be

a formal table - and a five minute on
each<00:04:34.740> iPhone

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
each iPhone

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.240 
each iPhone
hey<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:35.910> almost<00:04:36.420> like<00:04:36.510> iPhone<00:04:36.900> 6<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.410> iPhone<00:04:37.560> 7

but<00:04:42.260> depends<00:04:44.330> if<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.540> look<00:04:45.690> at<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.020> naming

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
but depends if you look at the naming

but depends if you look at the naming
structure<00:04:54.140> this<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.200> being<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.800> little<00:04:55.950> bit

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
structure this is being a little bit

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.610 
structure this is being a little bit
slow<00:04:56.220> here<00:04:56.250> for<00:04:56.760> us<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:58.020> mean<00:04:58.110> Apple<00:04:58.530> has

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
slow here for us and I mean Apple has

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.550 
slow here for us and I mean Apple has
been<00:04:58.650> doing<00:04:58.890> some<00:04:59.160> in<00:04:59.460> each<00:04:59.760> every<00:05:00.300> new<00:05:00.960> iPhone

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
been doing some in each every new iPhone

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.310 
been doing some in each every new iPhone
they<00:05:01.950> have<00:05:02.100> like<00:05:02.370> twice<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.030> speed

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
they have like twice the speed

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.050 
they have like twice the speed
especially<00:05:04.320> in<00:05:04.410> this<00:05:04.530> heat<00:05:04.770> bench<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.820> a

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
especially in this heat bench and a

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.690 
especially in this heat bench and a
benchmarking<00:05:06.660> app<00:05:07.220> which<00:05:08.220> is<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> little<00:05:08.610> bit

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
benchmarking app which is a little bit

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.780 
benchmarking app which is a little bit
fun<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.000> know<00:05:09.120> actually<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:10.430> fun<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.610> think

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
fun to know actually and fun to think

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.320 
fun to know actually and fun to think
about

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
about

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:22.550 
about
oh<00:05:14.960> yes<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.740> are<00:05:17.270> awesome<00:05:19.730> so<00:05:21.170> you<00:05:22.170> can<00:05:22.410> see<00:05:22.530> I

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
oh yes you are awesome so you can see I

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.350 
oh yes you are awesome so you can see I
mean<00:05:22.890> I<00:05:23.100> think<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.370> was<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.520> little<00:05:24.030> bit<00:05:24.180> higher

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
mean I think it was a little bit higher

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.410 
mean I think it was a little bit higher
score<00:05:24.780> here<00:05:25.140> especially<00:05:25.320> on<00:05:25.590> single<00:05:25.980> core<00:05:26.420> but

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
score here especially on single core but

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.460 
score here especially on single core but
not<00:05:27.690> really<00:05:28.260> rocket<00:05:28.650> science<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.840> yeah<00:05:30.870> real

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
not really rocket science so yeah real

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.950 
not really rocket science so yeah real
