whether<00:05:33.140> that<00:05:33.320> color<00:05:34.130> would<00:05:34.430> match<00:05:34.730> this

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
whether that color would match this

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.480 
whether that color would match this
cardstock<00:05:35.450> or<00:05:35.720> not<00:05:36.230> match<00:05:36.470> but<00:05:36.800> look<00:05:37.190> good<00:05:37.370> on

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
cardstock or not match but look good on

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.340 
cardstock or not match but look good on
