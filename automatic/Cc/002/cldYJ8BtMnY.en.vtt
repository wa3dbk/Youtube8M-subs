00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
make it and it's super easy beginner

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.990 
make it and it's super easy beginner
project<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.140> what<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.530> want<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.890> get<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.790> your

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
project so what you want to get is your

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.479 
project so what you want to get is your
fabric<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.600> stretch<00:00:47.989> fabric<00:00:48.589> and<00:00:48.739> then

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
fabric and stretch fabric and then

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.700 
fabric and stretch fabric and then
instead<00:00:49.909> of<00:00:50.030> folding<00:00:50.329> it<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:51.050> right<00:00:51.290> way<00:00:51.500> that

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
instead of folding it the right way that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.000 
instead of folding it the right way that
it<00:00:51.860> goes<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.220> fold<00:00:52.610> it<00:00:52.730> down<00:00:53.379> this<00:00:54.379> way

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
it goes you fold it down this way

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.649 
it goes you fold it down this way
so<00:00:55.250> usually<00:00:55.430> fabric<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.089> folded<00:00:56.239> over<00:00:56.480> that

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
so usually fabric is folded over that

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.750 
so usually fabric is folded over that
way<00:00:56.960> but<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.680> want<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:57.860> fold<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.190> down<00:00:58.220> that

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
way but you want to fold it down that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.179 
way but you want to fold it down that
way<00:00:58.909> because<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.420> want<00:00:59.720> it<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.439> be<00:01:00.619> really
