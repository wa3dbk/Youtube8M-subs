00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
around with it to see if we can create a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.089 
around with it to see if we can create a
replay<00:00:27.449> sort<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.930> live<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> show<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.010> you

replay sort of live on the show and you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.439 
replay sort of live on the show and you
can<00:00:29.130> guys<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.640> go<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.119> your<00:00:30.179> own<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
can guys then go off on your own and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
can guys then go off on your own and
practice<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.869> should<00:00:31.470> provide<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> nice<00:00:31.980> little

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
practice it should provide a nice little

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.160 
practice it should provide a nice little
way<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> guys<00:00:33.000> opening<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:33.840> replays

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
way of you guys opening your replays

version is pretty rare to bifurcate sort

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
version is pretty rare to bifurcate sort
of<00:00:47.879> backwards<00:00:48.270> he'll<00:00:48.420> bite<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.930> kick<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
of backwards he'll bite to get kick that

looks<00:00:49.950> looks<00:00:50.370> pretty<00:00:50.550> great<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
looks looks pretty great but the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
looks looks pretty great but the
instructions<00:00:51.329> only<00:00:51.480> go<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:51.989> far<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
instructions only go so far as sort of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
instructions only go so far as sort of
there<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.730> from<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.120> we're<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.420> of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
there and then from there we're kind of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.260 
there and then from there we're kind of
encouraged<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.410> make<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:55.980> along

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
encouraged to make it up as you go along

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.939 
encouraged to make it up as you go along
so<00:00:57.270> anyway<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.170> way<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.440> opener<00:00:58.770> works

twice contract your left glute and
contracture<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.810> glute<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.890> probably

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
contracture right glute we probably

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.109 
contracture right glute we probably
could<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.430> swapped<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.820> over

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
could have just swapped that over

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.219 
could have just swapped that over
actually<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.570> sure<00:01:33.659> why<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> bothered

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
actually I'm not sure why I bothered

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.539 
actually I'm not sure why I bothered
with<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.380> double<00:01:34.619> C<00:01:34.770> I'm<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.250> reading<00:01:35.430> the

PEC which is mouse wheel up on your left
PEC<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:04.020> contract<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:04.829> back

mouse wheel down on your right PEC I'm

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.910 
mouse wheel down on your right PEC I'm
sure<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.899> guys<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> pattern<00:02:07.740> here

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
sure you guys can see the pattern here

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.750 
sure you guys can see the pattern here
then<00:02:08.789> use<00:02:08.940> three<00:02:09.179> turns<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.660> spacebar<00:02:10.170> 1<00:02:10.500> 2

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
then use three turns so spacebar 1 2

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.089 
then use three turns so spacebar 1 2
three<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.720> want<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.930> extend<00:02:13.409> your<00:02:13.650> left

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
three then you want to extend your left

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.220 
three then you want to extend your left
knee<00:02:14.360> that's<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.720> put<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.959> into<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
knee that's going to put you into the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.839 
knee that's going to put you into the
into<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.920> jump<00:02:17.159> that<00:02:17.189> we've<00:02:17.400> seen<00:02:17.579> now<00:02:17.730> this

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
into the jump that we've seen now this

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.309 
into the jump that we've seen now this
is<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.090> far<00:02:18.269> as<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.480> instruction<00:02:18.720> score<00:02:19.200> so

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
is as far as the instruction score so

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.660 
is as far as the instruction score so
first<00:02:19.530> let's<00:02:19.769> see<00:02:19.860> how<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.010> plays<00:02:20.129> out<00:02:20.370> sort<00:02:20.640> of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
first let's see how it plays out sort of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.339 
first let's see how it plays out sort of
default<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.689> not<00:02:21.840> every<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.079> lot

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
default you can see not every a lot

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.390 
default you can see not every a lot
happens<00:02:22.680> there<00:02:22.829> Jeff<00:02:23.010> kind<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.280> gets

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
happens there Jeff kind of gets

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.679 
happens there Jeff kind of gets
catapulted<00:02:23.849> into<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.060> air<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.299> not<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> lot

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
catapulted into the air but not a lot

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.679 
catapulted into the air but not a lot
else<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.349> let's<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.769> play<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.129> replay<00:02:26.430> back

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
else so let's just play the replay back

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.729 
else so let's just play the replay back
okay<00:02:27.689> so<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.049> we're<00:02:28.200> gonna<00:02:28.290> want<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:28.530> jump

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
okay so I think we're gonna want to jump

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.339 
okay so I think we're gonna want to jump
in<00:02:28.860> around<00:02:29.400> about<00:02:29.849> yeah<00:02:30.569> run<00:02:30.780> about<00:02:30.930> there<00:02:31.200> as

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
in around about yeah run about there as

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.449 
in around about yeah run about there as
the<00:02:31.500> leg<00:02:31.650> goes<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.890> into<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.159> air<00:02:32.190> let's<00:02:32.400> see

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
the leg goes up into the air let's see

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.860 
the leg goes up into the air let's see
if<00:02:32.519> we<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.760> er<00:02:32.879> first<00:02:33.450> let's<00:02:33.720> see<00:02:33.780> what

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
if we can er first let's see what

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.330 
if we can er first let's see what
happens<00:02:34.079> if<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.200> extend<00:02:34.590> our<00:02:34.709> leg<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.220> maybe

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
happens if we extend our leg or maybe

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.830 
happens if we extend our leg or maybe
can<00:02:35.489> track<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.849> knee<00:02:36.030> yeah<00:02:36.420> maybe<00:02:36.569> we<00:02:36.659> can<00:02:36.750> get

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
can track the knee yeah maybe we can get

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.599 
can track the knee yeah maybe we can get
like<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.079> like<00:02:37.260> backward<00:02:37.769> snap<00:02:38.069> kick<00:02:38.340> go<00:02:38.519> and

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
like a like backward snap kick go and

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.640 
like a like backward snap kick go and
they'll<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:38.790> pretty<00:02:39.000> cool<00:02:39.180> Oh<00:02:39.540> actually<00:02:40.349> if<00:02:40.560> I
