I'd usually gravitate towards but for

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
I'd usually gravitate towards but for
some<00:00:26.189> reason<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.820> absolutely<00:00:27.510> love<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.230> is

lookbook<00:00:31.250> when<00:00:32.250> you're<00:00:32.399> working<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:32.850> such<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
lookbook when you're working with such a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.270 
lookbook when you're working with such a
monochromatic<00:00:33.630> color<00:00:34.140> palette<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:35.130> it's

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
monochromatic color palette I think it's

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
monochromatic color palette I think it's
really<00:00:35.550> important<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.360> try<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:36.960> inject<00:00:37.410> some

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
really important to try and inject some

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.369 
really important to try and inject some
sort<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.280> fun<00:00:38.550> into<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> outfit<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.079> took

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
sort of fun into the outfit so I took

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.680 
sort of fun into the outfit so I took
that<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:41.010> accessories<00:00:41.730> by<00:00:42.000> doing<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.510

silhouettes on this I love the skirt

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.209 
silhouettes on this I love the skirt
because<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.379> made<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
because it's made out of like the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.150 
because it's made out of like the
neoprene<00:00:50.850> scuba<00:00:51.210> material<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.949> gives

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
neoprene scuba material so it just gives

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:07.350 
neoprene scuba material so it just gives
this<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.399> cool<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.360> line<00:00:54.600> effect

already<00:01:24.020> placed<00:01:24.289> perfectly<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.280> rocker

already placed perfectly to that rocker

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.389 
already placed perfectly to that rocker
look<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.600> usually<00:01:27.200> they<00:01:27.380> opted<00:01:27.590> for<00:01:27.890> just

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
look but usually they opted for just

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.760 
look but usually they opted for just
black<00:01:28.729> I<00:01:29.030> decided<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.899> go<00:01:30.020> for<00:01:30.200> white<00:01:30.380> jeans

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
black I decided to go for white jeans

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.440 
black I decided to go for white jeans
with<00:01:31.039> something<00:01:31.369> different<00:01:31.549> but<00:01:32.090> because

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
with something different but because

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.240 
with something different but because
there's<00:01:32.659> still<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.140> distressed<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.860> flashed

up<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.580> legs<00:01:34.789> I<00:01:35.119> think<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.840> still<00:01:36.170> works

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
up the legs I think that it still works

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:53.940 
up the legs I think that it still works
for<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.740> kind<00:01:37.039> of<00:01:37.130> edgy<00:01:37.759> rocker<00:01:38.090> chick<00:01:38.360> I

know that often when people pick out a
party<00:01:57.080> outfit<00:01:57.470> they<00:01:57.649> want<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.890> go<00:01:58.009> for<00:01:58.250> bright

white is just too boring but that's not

look material which is something
different<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.800> don't<00:02:12.980> see<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.340> all<00:02:13.489> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
different you don't see that all the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.820 
different you don't see that all the
time<00:02:13.849> but<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.569> can<00:02:14.690> also<00:02:14.870> add<00:02:15.200> extra<00:02:15.379> punch

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
time but you can also add extra punch

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.970 
time but you can also add extra punch
with<00:02:16.129> a<00:02:16.310> massive<00:02:16.879> statement<00:02:17.599> necklace<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.260> I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
with a massive statement necklace and I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.040 
with a massive statement necklace and I
love<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.519> sugar<00:02:19.790> coat<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.569> texture<00:02:21.019> just

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
love the sugar coat the texture just

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:41.330 
love the sugar coat the texture just
gives<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.620> extra<00:02:21.920> drummer's<00:02:22.700> feel

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.710 

so<00:02:42.340> obviously<00:02:42.880> black<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:43.390> white<00:02:43.510> are

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
so obviously black and white are

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.170 
so obviously black and white are
considered<00:02:44.290> quite<00:02:44.500> conservative<00:02:45.010> tones<00:02:45.610> that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
considered quite conservative tones that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.670 
considered quite conservative tones that
is<00:02:46.300> easy<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.480> staff<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.080> office<00:02:47.440> and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
is easy to staff for the office and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.980 
is easy to staff for the office and
things<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.670> often<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.690> wouldn't

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
things like that so often you wouldn't

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.560 
things like that so often you wouldn't
associate<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.740> for<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.250> photo<00:02:51.880> sort<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.270> vibe

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
associate it for a photo sort of vibe

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.810 
associate it for a photo sort of vibe
but<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.200> think<00:02:53.590> it's<00:02:53.740> really<00:02:54.070> easy<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.550> do<00:02:54.790> that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
but I think it's really easy to do that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.720 
but I think it's really easy to do that
I<00:02:55.240> decided<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.170> clash<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.980> texture<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.700> I

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
I decided to clash with the texture so I

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.000 
I decided to clash with the texture so I
have<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.300> lace<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.810> pants<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.650> then

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
have the lace in the pants and this then

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.950 
have the lace in the pants and this then
this<00:03:00.190> really<00:03:00.550> awesome<00:03:00.790> ribbing<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> top

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
this really awesome ribbing on the top

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.560 
this really awesome ribbing on the top
also<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:03.100> think<00:03:03.310> with<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.760> silhouettes<00:03:04.300> I

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
also I think with the silhouettes I

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.900 
also I think with the silhouettes I
decided<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.320> go<00:03:05.470> for<00:03:05.710> a<00:03:05.740> loose<00:03:06.070> top<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.640> then

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
decided to go for a loose top and then

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.000 
decided to go for a loose top and then
with<00:03:07.120> wide<00:03:07.390> leg<00:03:07.660> pants<00:03:08.050> as<00:03:08.200> well<00:03:08.230> which

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.250
