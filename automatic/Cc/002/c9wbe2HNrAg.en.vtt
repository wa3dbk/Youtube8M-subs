00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.100 
dancing around about how he's trying I
mean<00:03:20.160> I'm<00:03:20.400> trying<00:03:20.700> as<00:03:20.880> well<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:24.080> come<00:03:25.080> on

interesting<00:03:25.890> contest

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
interesting contest

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.040 
interesting contest
cuz<00:03:27.000> they<00:03:27.120> go<00:03:27.270> about<00:03:27.480> what<00:03:27.690> they<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:27.900> in

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
cuz they go about what they do in

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.740 
cuz they go about what they do in
completely<00:03:28.920> different<00:03:29.130> ways<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.300> yet<00:03:30.690> I

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
completely different ways and yet I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.360 
completely different ways and yet I
think<00:03:30.870> they<00:03:31.140> get<00:03:31.320> there<00:03:31.620> or<00:03:31.890> they<00:03:32.040> reach<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
think they get there or they reach the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.240 
think they get there or they reach the
same<00:03:32.580> result<00:03:33.050> almost<00:03:34.050> identically<00:03:34.800> that's

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
same result almost identically that's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.840 
same result almost identically that's
not<00:03:35.600> good<00:03:36.600> France
