looking<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.279> real<00:00:32.520> estate<00:00:32.550> believe<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> or

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
looking into real estate believe it or

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.630 
looking into real estate believe it or
not<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.230> yeah<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:35.010> video<00:00:35.250> production<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
not so yeah my my video production is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
not so yeah my my video production is
going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:35.880> kind<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.149> low<00:00:36.390> until<00:00:36.930> probably

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
going to be kind of low until probably

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.490 
going to be kind of low until probably
theros<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.399> comes<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.879> September<00:00:39.500> m14

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
theros which comes out in September m14

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.380 
theros which comes out in September m14
which<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> second<00:00:41.399> reason<00:00:41.489> m14<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> just

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
which is the second reason m14 is just

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.880 
which is the second reason m14 is just
not<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> great<00:00:43.050> upset<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.680> find<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
not that great upset I don't find it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.029 
not that great upset I don't find it
that<00:00:43.950> fun<00:00:44.539> corsets<00:00:45.539> are<00:00:45.840> usually<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.350> amazing

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that fun corsets are usually not amazing

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830

is<00:01:05.070> actually<00:01:05.339> pretty<00:01:05.489> much<00:01:05.610> done<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.150> maybe

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is actually pretty much done so maybe

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
is actually pretty much done so maybe
i'll<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.659> video<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> cube<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
i'll make a video about what a cube is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000 
i'll make a video about what a cube is
and<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.670> course<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.439> show<00:01:10.439> off<00:01:10.590> my<00:01:10.770> cube

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and of course you know show off my cube

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
and of course you know show off my cube
which<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> points<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> having<00:01:12.299> q

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
which is a one of the points of having q

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.100 
which is a one of the points of having q
but<00:01:13.200> until<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.680> yeah<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.430> videos<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
but until then yeah not much videos and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.480 
but until then yeah not much videos and
actually<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> third<00:01:16.320> reason<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> my

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
actually the third reason is a lot of my

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
actually the third reason is a lot of my
free<00:01:17.700> time<00:01:17.729> instead<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> playing<00:01:19.049> magic<00:01:19.470> which

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
free time instead of playing magic which

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.960 
free time instead of playing magic which
you<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.920> requires<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> lot<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> thinking<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you know requires a lot of thinking and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
you know requires a lot of thinking and
sir<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.540> strategizing<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
sir you know strategizing that's just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.929 
sir you know strategizing that's just
how<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> play<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> game<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:23.790> been<00:01:23.850> playing

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
how to play that game I've been playing

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359
