00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.780 
but he's not explosive and I don't think
there's<00:01:27.990> very<00:01:28.170> much<00:01:28.320> upside<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.460> Mira

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
there's very much upside there to Mira

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.600 
there's very much upside there to Mira
Biscay<00:01:30.150> levels<00:01:30.840> off<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> number<00:01:32.009> 3<00:01:32.250> receiver

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
Biscay levels off as a number 3 receiver

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090 
Biscay levels off as a number 3 receiver
at<00:01:32.820> best<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
at best and and really that is that a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620 
at best and and really that is that a
late<00:01:35.340> first<00:01:35.549> round<00:01:35.850> pick<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.119> don't<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
late first round pick I don't think so I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
late first round pick I don't think so I
would<00:01:36.869> draft<00:01:37.079> him<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> third<00:01:37.590> fourth

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
would draft him in the third fourth

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.069 
would draft him in the third fourth
round<00:01:38.250> range<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.970> think<00:01:39.270> he's<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> lock<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
round range but I think he's a lock to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
round range but I think he's a lock to
come<00:01:40.200> off<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> board<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> second<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.460> those

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
come off the board in a second so those

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
come off the board in a second so those
are<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:42.090> three<00:01:42.390> overrated<00:01:43.020> brokers

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
are your top three overrated brokers

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.630 
are your top three overrated brokers
what<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.710> some<00:01:43.920> guys<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.340> might<00:01:44.490> be

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
what about some guys that might be

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.429 
what about some guys that might be
flying<00:01:44.970> under<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.270> radar<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.170> people

stronger<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> offseason<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.710> guess<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
stronger in the offseason I guess a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.920 
stronger in the offseason I guess a
little<00:02:02.460> part<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.479> fact<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.810> he

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
little part of it is the fact that he

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.560 
little part of it is the fact that he
didn't<00:02:04.170> run<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> great<00:02:04.829> 40<00:02:05.310> time<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.820> beany
