00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello here we are for the second 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.839
 video so for putting into practice the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.480
 chain parcel I present to you for 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.690
 this video jack their only roussel 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.000
 cousin of the rather dynamic russel jack of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.760
 reputation but you'll see that can 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.630
 to be a dog also very obedient see 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.640
 so 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.640
 we resume from the previous video 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.720
 you see that the chain necklace there 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.780
 our descendants and of course on the left 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:39.379
 you remember so small leash 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.960
 demo to lemmouchia so before 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.110
 anything to go to these helps 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.000
 above all remember before 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.440
 start a training session especially 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.890
 stretch your dog to make him 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.960
 its needs 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.239
 otherwise it can not be focused on 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.720
 what you will ask him and it will be a 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.079
 failure 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.899
 that's it then you see you start 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.780
 start sitting there let's see she's 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.149
 well relaxed you tell your dog at 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.539
 foot and your dog not at your feet 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:14.840
 here are sailboats small jerks 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.539
 leash collar relaxes 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.410
 automatically there are not two the 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:25.850
 dog has no pain we are at 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.490
 calm in kindness and his pose 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.490
 no problem so what are you doing 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.430
 especially you have to change the directions 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.509
 change your pace all that so that the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.049
 dog be focused to your direction to 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.860
 your your pace to your way of 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.509
 market etc 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.549
 this is the best way for the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.079
 marchau dog who if you advance to the 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.680
 same pace all the time the same 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.219
 direction 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:58.280
 fatally the dog will shoot a little 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:02:00.320
 al hijja demonstration ok you see if 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.750
 I act as if I had forgotten to 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.079
 I forgot my wallet but the dog 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.259
 must come back if he does not come back to you 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.690
 put a little chain like 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.910
 far and that's it reminds dogs 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.200
 especially should not shoot 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.160
 so that's the solution 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.070
 awesome now i'm going to show you 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.780
 with a dog that has never had a 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.440
 necklace chain and you will see 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.040
 it's blatantly started effective comes 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.040
 good 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.909
 so I present you junior I do not know 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.489
 who is a dorkel yorkie crusader who has 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.849
 nine months and so who has never put the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.489
 necklace chain so we'll see 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.719
 all because I never saw them 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.489
 still do together on the video what 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.280
 it gives exactly 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:19.370
 normally there should be no 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:22.629
 worry so the same I put the leash on the 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.629
 our descendants left 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:28.129
 So here you see the necklace 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.739
 chain for now for him there 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.629
 there is no difference since he did not 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.230
 not the notion of coming to the pine 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.139
 so let's put internet cheney and 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.109

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:46.370
 at the foot look I put a little bit of 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.739
 junior chains at the foot so early 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.810
 of course you have to go slowly 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.180
 you will not put big shots of 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.049
 jerks especially if you have a t-shirt 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.699
 especially encourage the admits to stay at 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.579
 foot here is there sitting at six juniors 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:08.209
 alas he does not want to sit down you help him 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:11.209
 with work like that sitting it's 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.560
 well here and you say junior at the foot 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:18.590
