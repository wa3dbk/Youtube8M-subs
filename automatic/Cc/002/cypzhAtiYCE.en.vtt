calm and in a previous video I
demonstrated<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.000> technique<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.540> frenching

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230

which resulted in this a French chicken
leg<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.179> has<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.690> pocket<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.009> some<00:00:14.549> excess

leg that has a pocket and some excess

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.269 
leg that has a pocket and some excess
skin<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.360> will<00:00:15.450> allow<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> stuff<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.830> now

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
skin that will allow you to stuff it now

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.830 
skin that will allow you to stuff it now
here<00:00:17.520> we're<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> stuff<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:18.270> minced

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
here we're going to stuff it with minced

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.990 
here we're going to stuff it with minced
chicken<00:00:19.140> meat<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.490> really<00:00:20.670> stuff<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
chicken meat but you can really stuff it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
chicken meat but you can really stuff it
with<00:00:21.119> anything<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.600> video<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.960> more<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.410> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
with anything so this video is more of a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
with anything so this video is more of a
conceptual<00:00:23.220> overview<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.539> would

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
conceptual overview of what you would

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.060 
conceptual overview of what you would
then<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.380> chicken<00:00:25.680> leg<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.830> thigh

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
then do with your chicken leg and thigh

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.070 
then do with your chicken leg and thigh
after<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.460> frenched<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.779> let<00:00:27.930> your

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
after you frenched it down but let your

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.839 
after you frenched it down but let your
own<00:00:28.260> creativity<00:00:28.890> lead<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.490> way<00:00:29.670> although

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
own creativity lead the way although

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.429 
own creativity lead the way although
this<00:00:30.060> isn't<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.510> bad<00:00:30.750> way<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> go<00:00:31.170> either

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this isn't really a bad way to go either

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.250 
this isn't really a bad way to go either
so<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.640> minced<00:00:33.059> chicken<00:00:33.840> thigh

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so here I have the minced chicken thigh

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
so here I have the minced chicken thigh
meat<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.829> I'm<00:00:35.550> sprinkling<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.329> little

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
meat and I'm sprinkling it with a little

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.110 
meat and I'm sprinkling it with a little
bit<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> kosher<00:00:37.350> salt<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.610> some<00:00:38.820> sliced

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
bit of kosher salt and then some sliced

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.610 
bit of kosher salt and then some sliced
shallots<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.719> added<00:00:39.960> right<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.200> top<00:00:40.379> I'm

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
shallots are added right on top I'm

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
shallots are added right on top I'm
going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> continue<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.850> chop<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.570> mince

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
going to continue to chop it and mince

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.930 
going to continue to chop it and mince
it<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.770> sprinkling<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.280> kosher<00:00:44.520> salt<00:00:44.700> is

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it and that sprinkling of kosher salt is

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
it and that sprinkling of kosher salt is
going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> help<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.570> release<00:00:46.260> some<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
going to help to release some of the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
going to help to release some of the
proteins<00:00:47.010> which<00:00:47.250> will<00:00:47.399> help<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.700> form

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
proteins which will help it form

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.610 
proteins which will help it form
together<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.360> stick<00:00:48.570> together<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.500> can

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
together and stick together so you can

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.350 
together and stick together so you can
see<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> basically<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.489> chicken

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
see I basically have like a chicken

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
see I basically have like a chicken
meatball<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.050> very<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.590> simple<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.010> now

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
meatball that's very very simple and now

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.160 
meatball that's very very simple and now
he's<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.390> chicken<00:00:54.690> meatball

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
he's going to take that chicken meatball

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.470 
he's going to take that chicken meatball
for<00:00:55.350> lack<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> better<00:00:55.800> term<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.550> stuff<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
for lack of a better term and stuff it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.569 
for lack of a better term and stuff it
into<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.899> pocket<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.980> created<00:00:59.370> when<00:00:59.460> we

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
into that pocket that we created when we

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
into that pocket that we created when we
tunnel<00:00:59.879> bone<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> chicken<00:01:00.510> leg<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.980> pack<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190

I'm<00:01:37.680> wrapping<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> plastic<00:01:38.490> wrap<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.790> around

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I'm wrapping the plastic wrap up around

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
I'm wrapping the plastic wrap up around
the<00:01:39.630> bone<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.079> once<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.890> point

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the bone and once I get to that point

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.410 
the bone and once I get to that point
I'm<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.490> give<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> couple<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> twists

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I'm going to give it a couple of twists

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420 
I'm going to give it a couple of twists
and<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.350> twisting<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> help

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and the twisting is just going to help

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
and the twisting is just going to help
the<00:01:44.850> leg<00:01:45.119> keep<00:01:45.479> its<00:01:45.659> shape<00:01:45.930> during<00:01:45.960> the

the leg keep its shape during the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.920 
the leg keep its shape during the
cooking<00:01:46.799> process<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.640> once<00:01:47.820> you've<00:01:48.030> twisted

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
cooking process now once you've twisted

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
cooking process now once you've twisted

wrap now there are a couple different

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.160 
wrap now there are a couple different
ways<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.390> cook<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:07.020> this

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
ways that you can cook this at this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.690 
ways that you can cook this at this
point<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.439> can<00:02:07.590> poach<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.280> steam<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
point you can poach it you can steam I

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.059 
point you can poach it you can steam I
prefer<00:02:09.090> steaming<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.500> reason<00:02:10.860> why<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
prefer steaming and the reason why is

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.949 
prefer steaming and the reason why is
this<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.640> steam<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.540> gentle

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
this the steam is going to be gentle

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.820 
this the steam is going to be gentle
heap

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
heap

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.170 
heap
because<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> barrier<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
because we have the barrier of the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.100 
because we have the barrier of the
plastic<00:02:15.840> wrap<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.260> well<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.730> chicken<00:02:18.210> leg<00:02:18.840> is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
plastic wrap as well the chicken leg is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.170 
plastic wrap as well the chicken leg is
going<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.650> naturally<00:02:19.920> release<00:02:20.460> its<00:02:20.730> juices

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
going to naturally release its juices

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.050 
going to naturally release its juices
and<00:02:21.740> what<00:02:22.740> will<00:02:22.860> happen<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:23.880> actually

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and what will happen is it will actually

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.300 
and what will happen is it will actually
poach<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.780> its<00:02:25.050> own<00:02:25.230> juices<00:02:25.680> contained<00:02:26.130> within

poach in its own juices contained within
that<00:02:26.970> plastic<00:02:27.480> wrap<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:27.870> I'm<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.350> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
that plastic wrap so I'm just going to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.920 
that plastic wrap so I'm just going to
cover<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.010> steam<00:02:29.250> tray<00:02:29.550> with<00:02:30.240> some<00:02:30.540> tin<00:02:30.750> foil

cover the steam tray with some tin foil

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.140 
cover the steam tray with some tin foil
that<00:02:31.170> way<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.590> steam<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.070> leg<00:02:32.250> bone<00:02:32.910> side

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
that way I can steam the leg bone side

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.700 
that way I can steam the leg bone side
up<00:02:33.390> during<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> entire<00:02:34.080> process<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.560> we're

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
up during the entire process and we're

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.290 
up during the entire process and we're
going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.950> steam<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:35.190> about<00:02:35.520> 25<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.030> 30

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
going to steam for about 25 to 30

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.150 
going to steam for about 25 to 30
minutes<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.690> you'll<00:02:37.140> notice<00:02:37.320> here<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:37.890> after

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
minutes and you'll notice here now after

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.310 
minutes and you'll notice here now after
the<00:02:38.250> end<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> steaming<00:02:38.910> process<00:02:39.320> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
the end of the steaming process the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.140 
the end of the steaming process the
chicken<00:02:40.710> leg<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.980> sitting<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.490> its<00:02:41.610> own<00:02:41.760> juices

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
chicken leg is sitting in its own juices

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.360 
chicken leg is sitting in its own juices
so<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:43.020> entire<00:02:43.410> time<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.860> technically

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
so as that entire time is technically

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.090 
so as that entire time is technically
poaching<00:02:45.060> gently<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:46.170> its<00:02:46.410> own<00:02:46.590> juices<00:02:46.950> would

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
poaching gently in its own juices would

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.860 
poaching gently in its own juices would
concentrate<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.880> flavor<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.420> give<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> a

nice finished product now you'll notice
here<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.270> leg<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.630> cooked<00:02:51.959> fully<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
here that the leg is cooked fully and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.590 
here that the leg is cooked fully and
holds<00:02:52.920> its<00:02:53.040> shape<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.640> now<00:02:54.120> there's<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.390> couple

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
holds its shape and now there's a couple

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.000 
holds its shape and now there's a couple
different<00:02:54.930> ways<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.560> finish<00:02:55.800> this

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
different ways that you can finish this

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.460 
different ways that you can finish this
off<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> first<00:02:57.120> one<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.540> through<00:02:58.140> butter

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
off now the first one is through butter

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.710 
off now the first one is through butter
basting<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.670> really<00:03:00.180> kind<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.690> pain

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
basting and it's really kind of a pain

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.880 
basting and it's really kind of a pain
lip<00:03:01.170> but<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:01.590> what<00:03:01.680> I'm<00:03:01.740> going<00:03:01.860> to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
lip but but what I'm going to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.080 
lip but but what I'm going to
demonstrate<00:03:02.040> anyways<00:03:02.640> just<00:03:02.670> because<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
demonstrate anyways just because the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.699 
demonstrate anyways just because the
good<00:03:03.270> technique<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.630> understand<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
good technique to understand and

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.350 
good technique to understand and
basically<00:03:05.370> with<00:03:05.580> butter<00:03:05.760> basting<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.180> way<00:03:06.330> I

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
basically with butter basting the way I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.580 
basically with butter basting the way I
do<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:06.900> bit<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.170> clarified<00:03:07.560> butter

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
do is a little bit of clarified butter

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.290
