scientists women in science is really

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.549 
scientists women in science is really
critical<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:33.059> know<00:00:33.090> women<00:00:34.050> have

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
critical because as you know women have

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.430 
critical because as you know women have
been<00:00:34.739> underrepresented<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.850> science

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440

the<00:02:11.950> many<00:02:12.099> luncheons<00:02:12.549> that<00:02:12.700> take<00:02:12.879> place<00:02:13.030> in

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the many luncheons that take place in

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.490 
the many luncheons that take place in
New<00:02:13.510> York<00:02:13.659> is<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.319> great

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
New York is I think it's this great

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.710 
New York is I think it's this great
opportunity<00:02:15.220> for<00:02:15.250> two<00:02:15.549> cultures<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.269> me<00:02:16.450> and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
opportunity for two cultures to me and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.420 
opportunity for two cultures to me and
the<00:02:16.840> way<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.349> tables<00:02:17.709> are<00:02:17.860> set<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.129> every

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the way that the tables are set up every

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.030 
the way that the tables are set up every
table<00:02:18.640> has<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:19.000> scientist<00:02:19.840> either<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.560> faculty

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
table has a scientist either a faculty

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.670 
table has a scientist either a faculty
member<00:02:21.189> or<00:02:21.340> student<00:02:21.790> or<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.329> postdoc<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.170> it's

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
member or student or a postdoc and it's

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.619 
member or student or a postdoc and it's
mutually<00:02:24.189> beneficial<00:02:24.579> so<00:02:25.000> we<00:02:25.180> get<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.450> talk

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
mutually beneficial so we get to talk

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.059 
mutually beneficial so we get to talk
about<00:02:25.659> our<00:02:25.900> science<00:02:26.440> which<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:26.890> think

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
about our science which I think

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.280 
about our science which I think
interests<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.790> women<00:02:28.060> who<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.239> guests<00:02:28.629> but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
interests the women who are guests but

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.619 
interests the women who are guests but
also<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.709> scientists<00:02:30.310> get<00:02:30.579> to<00:02:30.819> interact<00:02:31.150> with

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
also we scientists get to interact with

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.479 
also we scientists get to interact with
these<00:02:31.690> incredible<00:02:31.989> women<00:02:32.440> successful<00:02:33.340> in
