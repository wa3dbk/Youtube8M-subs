00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I've been practicing is I take it upside

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
I've been practicing is I take it upside
down<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.680> line<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.939> basically

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
down and I just line that but basically

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.219 
down and I just line that but basically
go<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.720> you're<00:01:33.810> wanting<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> want

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you're going to line a line really

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.350 
you're going to line a line really
slightly<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> online<00:01:38.790> as

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
slightly but you're going to online as

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.760 
slightly but you're going to online as
far<00:01:39.659> back<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:39.840> possible<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
far back as possible you're not going to

far back as possible you're not going to
want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> line<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> front<00:01:42.030> so

gonna lie right here and I got a little
too<00:01:58.110> much<00:01:58.259> glue<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.549> I'm<00:01:59.820> going<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.479> I'm

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
too much glue so I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
too much glue so I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:02:00.659> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.990> wipe<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.380> away<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> did

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
just going to wipe it away so what I did

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.179 
just going to wipe it away so what I did
this<00:02:03.180> point<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.990> took<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.380> paper<00:02:04.920> towel

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this point was I just took a paper towel

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.609 
this point was I just took a paper towel
to<00:02:05.880> wipe<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.329> extra<00:02:06.780> glue<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
to wipe the extra glue that I got on the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.050 
to wipe the extra glue that I got on the
bottom<00:02:08.009> lid<00:02:08.190> off

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
bottom lid off

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.669 
bottom lid off
and<00:02:09.179> I'm<00:02:09.360> using<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.810> white<00:02:10.020> glue<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
and I'm using a white glue so the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.320 
and I'm using a white glue so the
important<00:02:11.069> thing<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.300> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
important thing to know here is that a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.720 
important thing to know here is that a
white<00:02:12.480> glue<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.410> dry<00:02:13.680> clear<00:02:14.220> so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
white glue is going to dry clear so

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.920 
white glue is going to dry clear so
there's<00:02:14.880> definitely<00:02:15.030> no<00:02:15.330> need<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:15.690> nervous

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
there's definitely no need to be nervous

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.920 
there's definitely no need to be nervous
about<00:02:16.110> gluing<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.180> likely<00:02:18.690> would<00:02:18.840> be

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
about gluing so what a likely would be

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.330 
about gluing so what a likely would be
would<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.560> Elmer's<00:02:19.860> glue<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.190> I'm

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
would be like the Elmer's glue like I'm

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
would be like the Elmer's glue like I'm
using<00:02:20.640> or<00:02:21.209> something<00:02:21.630> called<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.900> ketaki<00:02:22.290> cool

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
using or something called a ketaki cool

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.190 
using or something called a ketaki cool
so<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.520> I'm<00:02:23.610> doing<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:24.150> I'm<00:02:24.420> taking<00:02:24.840> my

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
so what I'm doing is I'm taking my

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720 
so what I'm doing is I'm taking my
toothpick<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.489> from<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
toothpick and I'm going in from the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.000 
toothpick and I'm going in from the
front<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.239> glue<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.930> lining<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.800> top

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
front with my glue and lining the top

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.559 
front with my glue and lining the top
lid<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:29.849> I'm<00:02:29.910> doing<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> I'm<00:02:30.239> letting<00:02:30.480> as

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
lid so what I'm doing is I'm letting as

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.009 
lid so what I'm doing is I'm letting as
far<00:02:30.780> back<00:02:30.900> as<00:02:30.959> possible<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.760> lid<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.120> so

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
far back as possible on the lid just so

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.570 
far back as possible on the lid just so
it's<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.709> front<00:02:34.920> because<00:02:35.069> if<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.430> in

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it's not in the front because if it's in

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.949 
it's not in the front because if it's in
the<00:02:35.610> front<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.390> noticeable<00:02:36.750> as<00:02:36.870> all

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the front it can be noticeable as all

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.250 
the front it can be noticeable as all
gunky<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> don't<00:02:38.099> want<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.459> um<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.810> then

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
gunky so you don't want that um and then

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.710 
gunky so you don't want that um and then
I<00:02:40.290> also<00:02:40.530> went<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.130> from<00:02:41.400> behind<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.269> head<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
I also went in from behind the head and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.570 
I also went in from behind the head and
put<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.230> little<00:02:43.319> extra<00:02:43.620> glue<00:02:43.799> behind<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.340> didn't

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
put a little extra glue behind I didn't

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.979 
put a little extra glue behind I didn't
go<00:02:44.670> crazy<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.239> glue<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.870> definitely

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
go crazy on the glue but I definitely

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.020 
go crazy on the glue but I definitely
want<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.319> make<00:02:46.410> sure<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.590> had<00:02:46.739> enough<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.790> way

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
want to make sure I had enough that way

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.270 
want to make sure I had enough that way
the<00:02:48.180> eyelashes<00:02:48.600> would<00:02:48.840> stick<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.470> honestly

easier<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:07.099> glue<00:05:07.490> in<00:05:07.759> the<00:05:07.880> back<00:05:08.120> so<00:05:08.900> because

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
easier to glue in the back so because

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.499 
easier to glue in the back so because
i'm<00:05:09.530> not<00:05:09.590> using<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.919> hole<00:05:10.070> is<00:05:10.190> so<00:05:11.180> I'm<00:05:11.300> really

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
i'm not using the hole is so I'm really

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.640

just<00:05:11.599> going<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.840> put<00:05:11.990> glue<00:05:12.139> in<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.349> back<00:05:12.500> of

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
just going to put glue in the back of

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.560 
just going to put glue in the back of
the<00:05:12.710> head<00:05:12.860> um<00:05:13.070> like<00:05:14.000> where<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:14.270> can't<00:05:14.509> even

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
the head um like where you can't even

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.899 
the head um like where you can't even
see<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:14.960> just<00:05:15.620> glue<00:05:15.889> the<00:05:16.039> oilers<00:05:16.340> up<00:05:16.550> in<00:05:16.699> there

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.770 
the way extra almost what you're doing
really<00:05:22.280> isn't<00:05:22.789> that<00:05:22.909> difficult<00:05:23.259> it's<00:05:24.259> just

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
really isn't that difficult it's just

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.909 
really isn't that difficult it's just
like<00:05:26.780> it's<00:05:26.900> like<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.229> statue<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.740> I'm<00:05:27.800> like
