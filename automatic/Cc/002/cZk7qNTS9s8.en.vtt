00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
water for the macaroni now I always like

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.000 
water for the macaroni now I always like
to<00:00:15.630> use<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.780> lot<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.139> salt<00:00:16.440> because<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.859> gives

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
to use a lot of salt because that gives

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.980 
to use a lot of salt because that gives
the<00:00:17.160> flavor<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> macaroni<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.449> have

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the flavor to the macaroni I have

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.890 
the flavor to the macaroni I have
regular<00:00:19.199> elbows<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.330> cooks<00:00:21.750> for

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
regular elbows here and this cooks for

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.560 
regular elbows here and this cooks for
about<00:00:22.080> 12<00:00:22.590> minutes<00:00:22.830> total<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:24.180> really

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
about 12 minutes total but I'm really

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.060 
about 12 minutes total but I'm really
going<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.990> cook<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.560> 10

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to just cook it for about 10

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.419 
going to just cook it for about 10
minutes<00:00:26.279> because<00:00:26.930> eventually<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.890> macaroni

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
minutes because eventually the macaroni

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.890 
minutes because eventually the macaroni
is<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.849> baked<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
is going to be baked so it's going to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.209 
is going to be baked so it's going to
have<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.230> bit<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:31.500> cooking<00:00:31.859> time<00:00:31.890> when

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
have a little bit more cooking time when

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.459 
have a little bit more cooking time when
it<00:00:32.309> cooks<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> cheese<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.320> we'll<00:00:34.320> just

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it cooks with the cheese and we'll just

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.900 
it cooks with the cheese and we'll just
leave<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.800> there<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.130> cook<00:00:35.309> well<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
leave that there to cook well I do the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.830 
leave that there to cook well I do the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
intimidating it's not at all it's the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
one small onion map this is where the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.810 
one small onion map this is where the
flavor<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> come<00:00:56.489> we're<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.699> to

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:16.190 

now<00:01:05.580> I'll<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.299> into<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> pot

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.679 

1/4<00:01:17.200> cup<00:01:17.229> flour<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:20.590> sprinkle<00:01:21.040> that<00:01:21.159> in

and one of the things that you want to
do<00:01:23.950> at<00:01:24.159> this<00:01:24.610> stage<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:25.119> blend<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.869> around<00:01:26.110> and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
do at this stage is blend it around and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.080 
do at this stage is blend it around and
let<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.650> cook<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.040> little<00:01:27.190> bit<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.640> kind<00:01:27.970> of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
let it cook a little bit so that kind of

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.389 
let it cook a little bit so that kind of
raw<00:01:28.299> flavor<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.020> flour<00:01:29.290> cooks<00:01:29.680> out<00:01:29.890> but<00:01:30.310> as

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
raw flavor of the flour cooks out but as

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.620 
raw flavor of the flour cooks out but as
soon<00:01:30.580> as<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.820> kind<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.119> blends<00:01:31.390> with<00:01:31.600> the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
soon as it kind of blends with the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.660 
soon as it kind of blends with the
butter<00:01:31.930> then<00:01:32.649> you're<00:01:32.799> starting<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.220> form<00:01:33.490> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
butter then you're starting to form the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.180 
butter then you're starting to form the
thickener<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:34.930> you<00:01:35.049> can<00:01:35.200> see<00:01:35.380> here<00:01:35.590> it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
thickener so you can see here it's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.800 
thickener so you can see here it's
cooked<00:01:36.490> out<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> little<00:01:36.909> bit<00:01:37.180> it's<00:01:37.600> fully

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
cooked out a little bit it's fully

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.550 
cooked out a little bit it's fully
incorporated<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.880> add<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:41.110> quart
