00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
different versions of this camera but

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.070 
different versions of this camera but
they<00:00:22.890> all<00:00:22.980> look<00:00:23.160> identical<00:00:23.420> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> outside

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080

and this is what I used to mount
underneath<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.790> heli<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.420> aerial

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
underneath the heli for aerial

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.459 
underneath the heli for aerial
videography<00:00:32.690> but<00:00:33.690> you'll<00:00:33.870> need<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.140> make<00:00:34.289> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
mount is some one inch thick foam that I

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.970 
mount is some one inch thick foam that I
got<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.829> my<00:00:38.039> local<00:00:38.670> craft<00:00:38.879> store<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:42.710> some<00:00:43.710> tie

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
got at my local craft store and some tie

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.410 
got at my local craft store and some tie
wraps<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.460> sharp<00:00:47.760> pair<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:47.999> scissors<00:00:50.420> my

wraps the sharp pair of scissors my

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180 
wraps the sharp pair of scissors my
first<00:00:51.719> attempt<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.199> making<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.620> mount<00:00:52.890> was

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
first attempt at making a mount was

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
first attempt at making a mount was
taking<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> piece<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> foam<00:00:54.359> and<00:00:54.469> cutting<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
taking a piece of foam and cutting a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.599 
taking a piece of foam and cutting a
slit<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> pocket<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.339> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
slit in it like a pocket and I put the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.849 
slit in it like a pocket and I put the
camera<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.109> mounted<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.620> whole

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
camera in there and I mounted this whole

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
camera in there and I mounted this whole
thing<00:01:02.100> underneath<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.120> heli<00:01:03.320> but<00:01:04.320> this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
thing underneath the heli but this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
thing underneath the heli but this
proved<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.980> be<00:01:05.130> too<00:01:05.340> loose<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.910> mountain<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
proved to be too loose of a mountain I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750 
proved to be too loose of a mountain I
got<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> wavy<00:01:07.500> problems<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.460> most

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
got a lot of the wavy problems that most

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
got a lot of the wavy problems that most
people<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.480> little<00:01:09.660> cameras<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
people have with these little cameras so

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
people have with these little cameras so
instead<00:01:11.370> I<00:01:11.430> took<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> piece<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> phone<00:01:12.480> this

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
instead I took a piece of the phone this

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.590 
instead I took a piece of the phone this
is<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.170> four<00:01:13.830> inches<00:01:13.860> wide<00:01:14.520> by<00:01:14.940> about<00:01:14.970> three

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
is about four inches wide by about three

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.990 
is about four inches wide by about three
inches<00:01:15.870> high<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.410> cut<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.520> shape<00:01:17.730> of<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
inches high I cut it in a shape of a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.250 
inches high I cut it in a shape of a
cross<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.620> I<00:01:19.920> mount<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.900> landing

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
cross and then I mount it to the landing

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:33.200 
cross and then I mount it to the landing
gear<00:01:22.970> with<00:01:23.970> some<00:01:24.240> tie<00:01:24.450> wraps<00:01:24.920> like<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:42.859 

I<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:34.260> snip<00:01:34.770> off<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.220> excess<00:01:35.580> tie<00:01:35.850> wrap<00:01:41.869> next

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I just snip off the excess tie wrap next

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.540 
I just snip off the excess tie wrap next
step<00:01:43.050> is<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.380> take<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.740> camera<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.520> lens

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
step is to take the camera have lens

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.649 
step is to take the camera have lens
obviously<00:01:45.450> pointing<00:01:45.810> forward<00:01:46.909> stick<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.060> on

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
obviously pointing forward stick it on

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560 
obviously pointing forward stick it on
top<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.680> foam<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> back<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
top of the foam so the back of the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.480 
top of the foam so the back of the
camera<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.080> actually<00:01:52.229> resting<00:01:52.890> against<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
camera is actually resting against the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.980 
camera is actually resting against the
landing<00:01:53.970> gear<00:01:55.369> then<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.520> cut<00:01:57.090> some<00:01:57.330> pieces<00:01:57.659> of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
landing gear then I cut some pieces of

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.810 
landing gear then I cut some pieces of
foam<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.560> shims<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.430> are<00:01:59.580> different

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
foam as shims these are different

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.730 
foam as shims these are different
thicknesses<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.690> one's<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.229> quarter

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
thicknesses this one's about a quarter

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
thicknesses this one's about a quarter
of<00:02:01.770> an<00:02:01.920> inch<00:02:02.040> s<00:02:02.250> ones<00:02:02.460> maybe<00:02:02.700> three<00:02:03.090> eighths<00:02:03.270> or

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
of an inch s ones maybe three eighths or

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.930 
of an inch s ones maybe three eighths or
a<00:02:03.509> half<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.030> put<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.300> shim<00:02:07.940> underneath

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
a half you can put the shim underneath

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
a half you can put the shim underneath
there<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.539> adjust<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> angle<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
there and that adjust the angle of the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.199 
there and that adjust the angle of the
camera<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.430> getting<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.790> little<00:02:11.910> too

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
camera if you're getting a little too

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.780 
camera if you're getting a little too
much<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> bottom<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.350> canopy<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.580> can

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
much of the bottom of the canopy you can

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.560 
much of the bottom of the canopy you can
put<00:02:15.660> thicker<00:02:16.530> shim<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.160> there<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:21.269> makes<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
put thicker shim in there that makes the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:31.940 
put thicker shim in there that makes the
camera<00:02:21.870> point<00:02:22.200> down<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> little<00:02:22.709> bit<00:02:22.890> more

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:42.180 

you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.750 

the<00:02:43.190> biggest<00:02:43.370> problem<00:02:43.580> with<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.000> man

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
the biggest problem with this man

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.220 
the biggest problem with this man
there's<00:02:44.939> nothing<00:02:45.090> permanently<00:02:45.780> holding<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
there's nothing permanently holding the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.440 
there's nothing permanently holding the
