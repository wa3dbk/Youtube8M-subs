00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.479
 Good day! 

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:03.489
 This video will be about building 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.610
 Puzzle Rubiks Magic 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.389
 one of the easiest puzzles that requires 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.889
 quickness of movement, 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.529
 rather than knowing some definite formulas 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.869
 Briefly about this puzzle: 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.529
 it consists of eight plates 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.179
 4 to 2 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.429
 and its assembly is 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.539
 so from this state 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.109
 where three circles are on the same side 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.169
 you need to quickly bring her to this state 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.339
 where the three circles are crossed 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.260
 and how to collect it, I'll tell you now 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.300
 So how do you assemble this puzzle? 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.600
 There are three different solutions. 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.440
 from the very very slow 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.700
 until very fast. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.970
 And I will show you all 3 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.840
 simply because all 3 will be interesting 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.520
 So the very first method and the slowest 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.080
 however, it allows 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.460
 demonstrate all the features of this puzzle 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.920
 So, in order to collect, 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 we first bend the puzzle 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.780
 then move it, open it again 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.390
 fold on both sides, open from the bottom 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.750
 turn it so that this knot 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.490
 was used on the left side 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.950
 and so on 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.480
 So 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.387
 and everything is collected. 

00:01:37.047 --> 00:01:40.087
 Short again 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.460
 flip 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.380
 fold 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.900
 turn the knot in the left side and finish the assembly 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.120
 This is the first option, which is the slowest. 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.620
 Second option 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.380
 it is intermediate between which is the fastest 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.560
 and the one we just learned 

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:09.599
 So, what we will do 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.279
 the first movement we first have so 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.120
 here is this inscription Rubik's Magic 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.959
 was on the upper side 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.009
 we shift 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.859
 a puzzle like this 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.640
 and then we turn 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.460
 we first turn the upper right side 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.499
 towards the bottom left 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.559
 and then turn it to the bottom right 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.189
 everyone turned up like this and uncovered 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.510
 We came to a situation that was already, 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.619
 that the knot is on the left 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.780
 and now we can finally complete the build 

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:50.084
 if we move from the back side 

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:55.504
 So again this same method: 

00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:00.004
 So we shift 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.259
 turn, open up 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.029
 and go down 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.984
 all collected 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.444
 Well, the last, fastest method 

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:19.040
 which is used directly in competitions 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.619
 this 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.209
 the beginning is the same that we shift first, 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.990
 then turn over 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.820
 and then we do not straighten 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.260
 and immediately begin to unbend this method 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.879
 and she collected 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.000
 I'll show you slow down again 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.620
 mapped, turned 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.500
 up, left, back, right 

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:51.976
 and she collected 

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:02.876
 Well, the assembly of this puzzle takes 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.704
 from one to two seconds 

00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:05.769
 maybe up to three 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.759
 whichever 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.439
 how much to train 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.379
 in short, take and measure 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.300
 let's say one of the first results 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.020
 2 seconds, 2.03 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.140
 something like this 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.840
 this puzzle is going to 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.960
 Well that's all! 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.949
 Hope that was interesting 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.470
 Good luck in the assembly! Happily! Until!
