00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.900
 hello everyone this is a video 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.660
 fast I wanted to inform you about one 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.610
 what respect sony play is one 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.289
 little thing I discovered by force of 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:30.009
 play with the tool here maybe one 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.140
 which many will probably know 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.150
 somebody doesn't know anyway for all the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 girls who have hillary sonic or yes 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.640
 prepare to buy it is useful to know 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.100
 this thing and at least I did not have 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.570
 heard around but here I am 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.789
 noticed this thing and I care about 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:51.670
 sharing it with you is the clari 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:54.160
 sonic my my two though i think the thing 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.370
 applies to all brush types of 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.440
 any sonic club practically 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.300
 this is the sensitive head 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.030
 I'm going to drop it by doing one 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.960
 slight pressure, rotation pressure e 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.450
 then to definitely detach and this is the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.330
 head the head as you know presents 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.520
 the inner part that rotates a lot 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.689
 quickly and the outside that 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.759
 remains fixed 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.720
 if we go to turn the head you will notice 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.579
 these three plastic parts here that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.369
 they look like little springs in fact 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.590
 they are if you go to push towards 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.470
 the inside to make a slight pressure 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.320
 the central part of the head yes 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.020
 detaches and you have the part that rotates from one 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.820
 part and the fixed part on the other this 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.950
 part that rotates that its own 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.710
 plundering if we now go to it 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.360
 reinsert here with light pressure 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.329
 this time there is no need to give 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.719
 we have pressure and rotation 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.729
 once the central part is inserted, you know it 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:58.210
 I repeat is the one that turns is the one that goes 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.610
 to exfoliate if we now go to ad 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.310
 operate clari sonic we see that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.159
 we are perfectly able to do all the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.820
 turn of the nose and to be able to fight like this 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.430
 blackheads all over the nose and parts 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.470
 more critical than these are here and there 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.360
 those with the head mounted 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.090
 even with the fixed crown not 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.890
 you could achieve well 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.330
 especially with the exfoliating part 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.300
 because we don't forget that part 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.260
 inner wheel the outer part vibrates 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.010
 only and remains fixed I hope so much 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.260
 let this video help you I don't know 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.590
 if it's something you knew but I have it 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.800
 eco discovery I repeat so playing then 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.500
 in the end they come off, you have to do 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.030
 rotation is between simply el 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.250
 go and reinsert from above by doing one 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.560
 slight pressure and the head returns 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.510
 as it was in the beginning I make of you 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.940
 see the parts to press better here 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.810
 only 1 to 2 and 3 which are three springs 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.500
 allow you to remove the crown 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.390
 inside of 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.080
 I hope this fast video there 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.240
 is useful you will have understood from the title yes 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.070
 call clari sonic maybe you didn't know 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.410
 which the apple title helped 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.110
 choose it simona that you respect 09 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.280
 cosmopol as I can call it sto 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.450
 this video elevates that too 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.630
 space of the puzzles week 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.760
 maybe you didn't know that anyway 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.400
 guys I hope I have been useful to you 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.190
 let me know if you can clean up 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.300
 better nose like that but I have no doubt that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.100
 so be it 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.620
 I send you a kiss and I hope to be there 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.630
 a kiss was good bye the next 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.630
 video between that mania
