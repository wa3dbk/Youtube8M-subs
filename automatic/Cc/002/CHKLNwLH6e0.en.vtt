00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
there's two ways you can interact with

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.080 
there's two ways you can interact with
this<00:00:36.000> game<00:00:36.559> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.739> drive<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.820> talk

this game you can drive and you can talk
so<00:00:39.870> here's<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> driving<00:00:40.590> works<00:00:40.770> if

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
so here's how the driving works if

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.209 
so here's how the driving works if
you're<00:00:41.640> using<00:00:41.850> keyboard<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.690> mouse<00:00:42.750> at<00:00:42.930> least

you're using keyboard and mouse at least
your<00:00:44.219> left<00:00:44.489> hand<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.850> driving<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.710> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
your left hand will be driving and the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.810 
your left hand will be driving and the
only<00:00:46.800> thing<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.039> actually<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
only thing you actually have to do to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
only thing you actually have to do to
drive<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.360> hold<00:00:48.539> down<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> single<00:00:49.050> key<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
drive is just hold down a single key you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.720

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
pedal basically and if you release it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.049 
pedal basically and if you release it
this<00:00:53.699> happens<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:56.399> slows<00:00:56.640> down<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> you

very passive experience of just watching
a<00:01:37.920> car<00:01:38.100> go<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> imagining<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.390> you're

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
a car go and imagining that you're

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.090 
a car go and imagining that you're
driving<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.560> turns<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> into<00:01:40.890> an

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
driving it and it turns it into an

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.859 
driving it and it turns it into an
actual<00:01:41.400> active<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
actual active thing because you have to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.090 
actual active thing because you have to
actually<00:01:43.229> hold<00:01:43.350> down<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> key<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
actually hold down the key you have to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
actually hold down the key you have to
actually<00:01:44.250> drive<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:45.659> driving<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> most

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
actually drive it's driving in the most

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
actually drive it's driving in the most
simplest<00:01:46.740> form<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.430> driving<00:01:47.790> you're

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
simplest form but it is driving you're

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.700 
simplest form but it is driving you're
holding<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> key<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.590> an

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
holding out a key and it's a it's an

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.210 
holding out a key and it's a it's an
active<00:01:50.070> action<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.759> passive<00:01:52.009> which<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
active action it's not passive which is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.330 
active action it's not passive which is
pretty<00:01:53.549> damn<00:01:53.759> cool<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.950> other<00:01:56.070> thing<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
pretty damn cool and the other thing you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
pretty damn cool and the other thing you
do<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.640> talking

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
do is talking

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.320 
do is talking
so<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.010> game<00:01:59.159> has<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.370> branching<00:01:59.880> dialogue

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
so this game has a branching dialogue

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.289 
so this game has a branching dialogue
and<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.409> branching<00:02:01.770> dialogue<00:02:02.100> has<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.700> pretty

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
and that branching dialogue has a pretty

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.290 
and that branching dialogue has a pretty
big<00:02:03.420> effect<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:04.010> what<00:02:05.010> happens<00:02:05.090> which<00:02:06.090> I'll

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
big effect on what happens which I'll

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.949 
big effect on what happens which I'll
get<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:06.960> bit<00:02:07.020> later<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.750> writing

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
get to a little bit later so the writing

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.510 
get to a little bit later so the writing
is<00:02:10.200> probably<00:02:10.740> my<00:02:10.860> favorite<00:02:11.220> part<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.430> this

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
car and then you get to choose whether

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.509 
car and then you get to choose whether
he<00:03:02.310> did<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:02.700> reluctantly<00:03:03.150> or<00:03:03.980> if<00:03:04.980> he<00:03:05.100> insisted

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519

he did so reluctantly or if he insisted
on<00:03:05.670> fixing<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:07.019> you'd<00:03:07.200> actually<00:03:07.380> decide<00:03:07.829> if

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
on fixing it so you'd actually decide if

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.949 
on fixing it so you'd actually decide if
you<00:03:08.459> want<00:03:08.700> your<00:03:09.120> relationship<00:03:09.150> with<00:03:09.720> your<00:03:09.810> dad

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
past so-and-so building and then the

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.620 
past so-and-so building and then the
building<00:04:27.310> pops<00:04:27.759> up<00:04:27.910> in<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.060> background<00:04:28.419> as

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
building pops up in the background as

building pops up in the background as
you<00:04:28.870> drive<00:04:29.020> past<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:32.349> also<00:04:32.470> as<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:32.710> drive

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
you drive past it and also as you drive

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.580 
you drive past it and also as you drive
on<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.849> storm<00:04:34.360> that's<00:04:34.599> pelting<00:04:35.199> me<00:04:35.229> right<00:04:35.470> now

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
on the storm that's pelting me right now

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.320 
on the storm that's pelting me right now
becomes<00:04:35.919> even<00:04:36.310> more<00:04:36.340> severe<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:37.030> starts<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
becomes even more severe it starts to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.550 
becomes even more severe it starts to
get<00:04:37.449> worse<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.960> worse<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:41.320> really

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
get worse and worse and that really

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.230 
get worse and worse and that really
reflects<00:04:41.979> how<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.280> conversation<00:04:43.000> with<00:04:43.150> your

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
reflects how the conversation with your

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.060 
reflects how the conversation with your
family<00:04:43.539> goes<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:43.810> because<00:04:44.259> just<00:04:44.500> as<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.740> storm

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
family goes to because just as the storm

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.560 
family goes to because just as the storm
is<00:04:45.190> getting<00:04:45.400> more<00:04:45.550> chaotic<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.090> crazy

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
is getting more chaotic and crazy

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.140 
is getting more chaotic and crazy
so<00:04:47.560> is<00:04:47.680> your<00:04:47.800> conversation<00:04:48.370> because<00:04:49.060> I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
so is your conversation because I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.120 
so is your conversation because I
mention<00:04:49.479> that<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.560> your<00:04:50.680> family<00:04:50.979> you're

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
mention that you and your family you're

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.189 
mention that you and your family you're
dealing<00:04:51.370> with<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.490> lot<00:04:51.639> of<00:04:51.669> issues<00:04:51.849> and<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:53.050> lot

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
dealing with a lot of issues and a lot

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.050 
dealing with a lot of issues and a lot
of<00:04:53.229> things<00:04:53.470> just<00:04:53.740> end<00:04:53.919> up<00:04:54.039> bubbling<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.030> the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
of things just end up bubbling to the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.700 
of things just end up bubbling to the
surface<00:04:55.180> as<00:04:55.599> you're<00:04:55.750> talking<00:04:55.870> with<00:04:56.169> them<00:04:56.320> and

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
surface as you're talking with them and

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.689 
surface as you're talking with them and
so<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.460> chaos<00:04:57.759> outside<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:59.530> weather

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
so the chaos outside in the weather

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.920 
so the chaos outside in the weather
really<00:05:00.699> reflects<00:05:01.060> what's<00:05:01.300> happening<00:05:01.630> kind<00:05:01.810> of

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
really reflects what's happening kind of

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.260 
really reflects what's happening kind of
in<00:05:02.229> your<00:05:02.470> own<00:05:02.560> life<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:06.909> constant

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
in your own life and the constant

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.580 
in your own life and the constant
movement<00:05:07.449> of<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.750> car<00:05:07.930> itself<00:05:08.259> to<00:05:08.560> just

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
movement of the car itself to just

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.689 
movement of the car itself to just
always<00:05:09.220> moving<00:05:09.460> forwards<00:05:09.970> into<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.240> storm<00:05:11.699> that

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
always moving forwards into a storm that

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.339 
always moving forwards into a storm that
itself<00:05:13.060> kind<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.389> just<00:05:13.570> feels<00:05:13.840> like<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:13.990> a

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
itself kind of just feels like a a

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.540 
itself kind of just feels like a a
metaphor<00:05:15.070> for<00:05:15.280> life<00:05:15.340> basically

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.029 

overall<00:05:19.419> it's<00:05:19.690> just<00:05:19.930> an<00:05:20.289> exceptionally

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
overall it's just an exceptionally

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.800 
overall it's just an exceptionally
well-written<00:05:21.340> game<00:05:21.669> with<00:05:22.360> some<00:05:22.509> good<00:05:22.660> art

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
well-written game with some good art

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.409 
well-written game with some good art
that<00:05:23.020> also<00:05:23.319> accentuates<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:23.979> writing<00:05:24.419> it

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
that also accentuates the writing it

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.390 
that also accentuates the writing it
just<00:05:25.629> really<00:05:25.810> resonated<00:05:26.259> with<00:05:26.349> me<00:05:26.500> it's<00:05:27.250> such
