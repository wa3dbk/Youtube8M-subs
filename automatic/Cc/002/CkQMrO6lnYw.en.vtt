00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.940
 hello to all and welcome to the head to do it for the tcd 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.640
 to the dedications of luxury worthy death so you've understood we're going to go to the 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.339
 Mountain 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.019
 to start choosing our strong spell 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.429
 for samba a joint pot shot several features this one 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.900
 edwards is pretty balanced overall these features 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.110
 we will take someone who will be a little more comfortable in speed 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.939
 it is very good 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.679
 and so we have several mountains 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.709
 the names of several types of tracks to go 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.360
 you've seen it in the close unlock you have one to six in total 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.870
 so more how to develop more quickly you accumulate 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.440
 stars that can be either hidden on% on the track 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.000
 evening by winning events 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.990
 the reasons for the moment a reason to unblock chile who says no 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.960
 foolishness 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.700
 and for many to start in Japan and offering a 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.290
 race 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 so that's why 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.420
 these partitions 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.720
 on the organ 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.579
 the change is conciliatory 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.720
 so I take the opportunity to explain to you quickly 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.850
 in the game you will see it on the screen 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.040
 we have a lot of buttons that appear 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.800
 and for all of us obviously a precise function then it can be 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.740
 to accelerate to brake finally not to brake since in fact 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 always what we hear the tablet 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.539
 so we can speed up the operation on time 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.539
 finally you will see a function like who are very nice 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.540
 so it should not be long before douala 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.530
 so we are 6 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.830
 and so obviously the goal is to arrive 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.040
 at the finish line in premiership 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.100
 so I did not necessarily win the race there for the shot 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.930
 let me explain 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.540
 focus to finally be able to little bit and opportunities clamecy this live 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.010
 then we'll do a little bit of a tour 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.680
 a little button here 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.500
 so that gives the impetus 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.060
 so -avi deal just before a jump 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.230
 even for example recover them from a part of this live 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.730
 see propelling the 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.490
 I was a little bit short 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 but Thursday in Lille heap flowers by operating the tablet 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.579
 FrÃ©mont 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.969
 and I wonder if the acceleration in one year France in this sense 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.449
 no then for example if I want 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 the king fahd experts fell on a bone on order 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:28.900
 after an obstacle thanks to the earlier we made sign here so I have 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.739
 missed my jump I have a small 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.269
 a small function I allow myself to go back 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.279
 for the recount 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.269
 marc obviously it's not 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.209
 % 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.829
 we will go to infinity since you saw we have a city adventurer 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.039
 decrease since its creation 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.049
 in the same principle 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.699
 if you accelerate 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:50.859
 a little talkative 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.889
 it will not be easy if you are 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.489
 good it's not my thing if you're comfortable 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.679
 if you are his sophocle rivals 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.289
 do not consume your this same bar 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.199
 a class 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.329
 it will make pass 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.699
 it's a little more detail 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.579
 here 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.579
 31 'this live 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.969
 gold a feature that is related to this red bar braided the 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.069
 possibility of slowing down the time so there 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.159
 I'm going to make a quieter game but figure 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.289
 ah it is precisely 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.199
 m ask here but I restart the time correctly 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.199
 so in fact in slow motion or even half or so 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:34.939
 when I arrived 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.430
 so the mountain liguori poet hassiba I finish when the first 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.199
 a bank will launch a new title 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 runway new type of runway 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.560
 so we'll go this time 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.349
 direction united states 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.449
 so-called crystalline studies 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.449
 so here too you have to accumulate the maximum points 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.249
 now we're going to change some because yes you saw it 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.509
 just now he is not very very comfortable 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:12.839
 Surono 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.969
 on the sad in the next two and a half months I'm here 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.000
 relaxed who's gnawing you think it'll be a little friendlier with him 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.529
 here we go 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.479
 then the city sign 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.879
 the game is very fluid 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.809
 very pretty 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:32.349
 so it is realized what is called the police launched Thursday a system of 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:32.810
 sale 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.270
 you can graphics are saints 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.880
 but suddenly we knew at least a little stamp to the young people who does not better 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.729
 no worse that is not common 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.490
 and for 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.410
 she's learning a lot by the fact that fluidity the whole 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.600
 glitter animation 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.529
 no problem on it 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.800
 it's super handy saas it's really a surprise 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 so why this fear who is virgin 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.419
 concentrating on employment pole follows the city she recalled then 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.419
 I use my function 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.449
 it's already a little more fun 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.219
 when a special little internship 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.350
 a beach more then tell you that everyone 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.139
 the points of 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.239
 I just realized on the Sahelian band by chaining with a 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.889
 a little figure 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.490
 m about twenty activists at afp flynn have a little bit accurate 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.520
 the goal is obviously to score the maximum points 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.289
 1 for example the target tent 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.360
 Well, I'm not comfortable 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.189
 it's not not necessarily obvious 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.049
 finally the first jumps to the city of this little bit with an eclipse they 

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:49.569
 will be passionate 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.289
 you have to see my planned training challenges the complex and chain the 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.029
 points 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.279
 good I also think that the action has made a lot of the web tour 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.330
 let's go for it's a good surprise 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.189
 and I get for that a little more than 5 euros 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.189
 so the world is really finished we advise you 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.289
 and it is available on the app store 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.569
 since 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.309
 for a few days now and we are meeting for very soon 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.819
 on alta point fr for a new video will test the luggage
