before<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.580> again<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.029> week<00:00:30.269> by<00:00:30.420> point

before I'm up again this week by point

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
two pounds but I'm feeling a touch

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.530 
two pounds but I'm feeling a touch
leaner<00:00:33.980> I<00:00:34.980> did<00:00:35.460> hit<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> new<00:00:35.850> low<00:00:36.090> couple<00:00:36.480> of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
leaner I did hit a new low couple of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440 
leaner I did hit a new low couple of
days<00:00:36.719> ago<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.290> thought<00:00:37.940> there<00:00:38.940> would<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.090> kind

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
days ago and thought there would be kind

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.000 
days ago and thought there would be kind
of<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> downward<00:00:39.930> trend<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of a downward trend from there and it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.380 
of a downward trend from there and it
went<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.940> other<00:00:42.059> way<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> hit<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> new<00:00:43.800> low<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
went the other way so I hit a new low of

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.740 
went the other way so I hit a new low of
170<00:00:45.390> 2.3<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.309> went<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.760> into<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> 173

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
170 2.3 then it went up to into the 173

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
170 2.3 then it went up to into the 173
somewhere<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> had<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> random

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
somewhere and then I had a random

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
somewhere and then I had a random
weighing<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.329> 170<00:00:51.930> 4.9<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:54.230> yes<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> day

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
weighing at 170 4.9 and yes the day

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.189 
weighing at 170 4.9 and yes the day
before<00:00:55.770> yesterday<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
before yesterday and so that kind of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.580 
before yesterday and so that kind of
they'll<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.250> confusing<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.270> don't<00:01:01.199> know

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
they'll be confusing but I don't know

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.889 
they'll be confusing but I don't know
why<00:01:01.820> I've<00:01:02.820> had<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> couple<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> high<00:01:03.600> sodium

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
why I've had a couple of high sodium

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.380 
why I've had a couple of high sodium
days<00:01:04.409> according<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.189> my<00:01:05.489> fitness<00:01:05.729> powers<00:01:06.119> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
days according to my fitness powers so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780 
days according to my fitness powers so
that<00:01:06.420> could<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.110> reason<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> could<00:01:08.760> be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that could be a reason or it could be

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.010 
that could be a reason or it could be
the<00:01:08.909> fact<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.600> haven't<00:01:09.900> lost

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the fact that I just haven't lost

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
the fact that I just haven't lost
anything<00:01:10.580> feeling<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.820> bit<00:01:11.909> leaner<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
anything feeling a little bit leaner in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.310 
anything feeling a little bit leaner in
areas<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.590> massively<00:01:14.930> as<00:01:15.930> far<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

weeks<00:01:16.500> gone<00:01:16.939> leg<00:01:17.939> sessions<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:18.659> starting<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.120 
weeks gone leg sessions I'm starting to
struggle<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.409> little<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.710> we're<00:01:19.830> done<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
struggle a little but we're done the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.149 
struggle a little but we're done the
pushing<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.640> general<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:22.530> find<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> I'm

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
pushing in general I just find that I'm

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.399 
pushing in general I just find that I'm
really<00:01:24.030> struggling<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.509> recover<00:01:24.659> from<00:01:25.110> my

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
really struggling to recover from my

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
deadlifts I mean fortunately I'm going

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.569 
deadlifts I mean fortunately I'm going
on<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> back<00:01:27.450> squats<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.020> next<00:01:28.229> cycle<00:01:28.579> but

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
on to back squats in my next cycle but

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.490 
on to back squats in my next cycle but
the<00:01:30.000> dead<00:01:30.210> lifts<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.900> kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> makes<00:01:31.320> me

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the dead lifts it just kind of makes me

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.890 
the dead lifts it just kind of makes me
really<00:01:31.650> sluggish<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.549> few<00:01:33.479> days<00:01:33.659> after

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
really sluggish the few days after

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.249 
really sluggish the few days after
because<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.439> obviously<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> lot

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
because I'm obviously there's a lot

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.520 
because I'm obviously there's a lot
fatigue<00:01:38.299> my<00:01:39.299> lower<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.350> know

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
fatigue my lower back all of you know

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.030 
fatigue my lower back all of you know
quite<00:01:40.770> harsh<00:01:41.070> thumbs<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.710> yeah<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:43.799> just

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
quite harsh thumbs and yeah I'm just

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
quite harsh thumbs and yeah I'm just
struggling<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.240> moving<00:01:46.170> around<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
struggling with with moving around the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.819 
struggling with with moving around the
few<00:01:47.670> days<00:01:47.880> after<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.649> that's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
few days after so i think that's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.530 
few days after so i think that's
contributing<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.700> overall<00:01:51.180> calorie

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
contributing to my overall calorie

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.859 
contributing to my overall calorie
expenditure<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.970> obviously<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.360> i<00:01:54.479> turned

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
expenditure and so obviously as i turned

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.700 
expenditure and so obviously as i turned
into<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.409> cripple<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:58.320> don't

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
into a bit of a cripple I just don't

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.569 
into a bit of a cripple I just don't
move<00:01:58.890> around<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.310> much<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:01.310> guess<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.490> not

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
move around as much and I guess it's not

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
move around as much and I guess it's not
really<00:02:02.750> it's<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:03.960> cuz<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> don't<00:02:04.350> want

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
really it's not really cuz I don't want

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.370 
really it's not really cuz I don't want
to<00:02:04.939> because<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.119> i<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.659> if<00:02:06.990> i<00:02:07.140> get

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to because I do i know that if i get

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.110 
to because I do i know that if i get
lazy<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:08.580> BMR<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.959> down<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.530> non<00:02:11.340> exercise

calories you burn just through everyday

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.150 
calories you burn just through everyday
activities<00:02:16.840> will<00:02:17.020> go<00:02:17.200> down<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.770> knife<00:02:17.920> that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
activities will go down and a knife that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
going to be eating at maintenance and I

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.690 
going to be eating at maintenance and I
don't<00:02:23.620> want<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.830> do<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.310> I'm<00:02:24.400> conscious

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
don't want to do that so I'm conscious

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.280 
don't want to do that so I'm conscious
of<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.150> fact<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.599> do<00:02:25.720> need<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.080> move

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
of the fact that I do need to move

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.380 
of the fact that I do need to move
around<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:26.650> much<00:02:26.770> as<00:02:26.950> possible<00:02:27.099> but<00:02:28.030> obviously

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
around as much as possible but obviously

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.490 
around as much as possible but obviously
with<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.450> intense<00:02:31.810> training<00:02:32.170> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
with the in the intense training the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.390 
with the in the intense training the
calorie<00:02:32.890> deficit<00:02:34.200> I'm<00:02:35.200> struggling<00:02:36.160> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
calorie deficit I'm struggling to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.040 
calorie deficit I'm struggling to
recover<00:02:36.550> which<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.269> then<00:02:37.510> making<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
recover which is then making it

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.150 
recover which is then making it
difficult<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.470> me<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.920> move<00:02:39.069> around<00:02:39.430> or

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
difficult for me to move around or

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.110 
difficult for me to move around or
subconsciously<00:02:42.160> making<00:02:42.550> me<00:02:42.640> not<00:02:42.819> want<00:02:43.060> to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
subconsciously making me not want to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.289 
subconsciously making me not want to
move<00:02:43.360> around<00:02:43.599> as<00:02:43.840> much<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.910> think<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.269> is

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
move around as much and I think that is

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.300 
move around as much and I think that is
really<00:02:46.510> contributing<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.709> fact<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.069> I'm

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
really contributing to the fact that I'm

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.120 
really contributing to the fact that I'm
not<00:02:48.489> perhaps<00:02:48.790> losing<00:02:49.090> at<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> rate<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.130> I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
not perhaps losing at a rate that I

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.210 
not perhaps losing at a rate that I
should<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:52.120> spoke<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:53.100> eric<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:55.920> he<00:02:56.920> thinks

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
should be I spoke to eric and he thinks

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.589 
should be I spoke to eric and he thinks
I've<00:02:57.310> got<00:02:57.430> about<00:02:57.519> seven<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> ten<00:02:58.180> pounds<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
I've got about seven to ten pounds to

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.789 
I've got about seven to ten pounds to
lose<00:02:58.630> which<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.049> exactly<00:02:59.200> kind<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.680> what<00:02:59.769> i

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
lose which is exactly kind of what i

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.350 
lose which is exactly kind of what i
thought<00:02:59.860> i<00:03:00.250> thought<00:03:00.280> eight<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.730> ten<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.120> seven

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
thought i thought eight to ten so seven

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.009 
thought i thought eight to ten so seven
to<00:03:01.450> ten<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:01.690> about<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.959> same<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:03.720> yes<00:03:04.720> I've

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
to ten is about the same and yes I've

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
potential shows coming through you know

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.910 
potential shows coming through you know
you've<00:03:10.810> got<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.930> show<00:03:11.140> pretty<00:03:11.410> much<00:03:11.530> every

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
you've got to show pretty much every

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.280 
you've got to show pretty much every
week<00:03:12.099> for<00:03:12.400> about<00:03:12.489> six<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.510> eight<00:03:13.540> weeks<00:03:13.690> after

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
week for about six to eight weeks after

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.259 
week for about six to eight weeks after
that<00:03:14.440> said<00:03:14.620> 11<00:03:14.920> hour<00:03:15.069> weeks<00:03:15.580> out<00:03:15.760> for<00:03:15.910> my<00:03:16.000> first

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
that said 11 hour weeks out for my first

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.660 
that said 11 hour weeks out for my first
show<00:03:16.599> so<00:03:17.230> if<00:03:17.320> i<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:17.680> down<00:03:17.890> seven<00:03:18.280> pounds

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
over the next 11 or so weeks then kind

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.420 
over the next 11 or so weeks then kind
of<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:23.049> sounds<00:03:23.350> good<00:03:23.530> i'll<00:03:24.130> be<00:03:24.280> happy

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
of that that sounds good i'll be happy

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.160 
of that that sounds good i'll be happy
with<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:24.700> get<00:03:25.180> seven<00:03:25.480> pounds<00:03:25.720> down<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.079> then

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
with that get seven pounds down and then

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.810 
with that get seven pounds down and then
if<00:03:26.290> i<00:03:26.410> do<00:03:26.470> need<00:03:26.769> to<00:03:26.829> lose<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.160> few<00:03:27.280> more<00:03:27.579> pounds

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
if i do need to lose a few more pounds

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.590 
if i do need to lose a few more pounds
to<00:03:28.500> get<00:03:29.500> really<00:03:29.739> really<00:03:29.950> lean<00:03:30.250> then<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:31.000> can<00:03:31.450> do

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
to get really really lean then I can do

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.300 
to get really really lean then I can do
shows<00:03:31.840> after<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:32.890> probably<00:03:33.100> what

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
shows after that so that's probably what

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.190 
shows after that so that's probably what
I'm<00:03:33.400> going<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.579> do<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:34.660> I'm<00:03:34.780> just<00:03:34.930> really

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
I'm going to do but I'm just really

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.229 
I'm going to do but I'm just really
hoping<00:03:35.319> that<00:03:35.890> i<00:03:36.160> can<00:03:36.430> start<00:03:36.760> shifting<00:03:36.970> some

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
hoping that i can start shifting some

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.479 
hoping that i can start shifting some
weight<00:03:37.450> soon<00:03:39.630> because<00:03:40.630> obviously<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:42.280> last

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
weight soon because obviously the last
