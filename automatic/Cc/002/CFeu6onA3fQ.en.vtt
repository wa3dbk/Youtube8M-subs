for it probably the title or emblem or
something<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.310> my<00:01:35.460> opinion<00:01:35.640> in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
something like that but in my opinion in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.050 
something like that but in my opinion in
my<00:01:36.600> opinion<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.740> emblems<00:01:38.070> they<00:01:38.640> give<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
my opinion all the emblems they give you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
my opinion all the emblems they give you
are<00:01:39.180> ugly<00:01:39.390> let's<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.229> close<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> stage

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
are ugly let's just close the stage

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.649 
are ugly let's just close the stage
emblems<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:41.820> whatever<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.210> think<00:01:42.420> they're<00:01:42.540> all

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
emblems or whatever I think they're all

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830
