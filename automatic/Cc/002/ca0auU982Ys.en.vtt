00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
 8th 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.539
 Dr 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.559
 Hello on the other hand never with her own knee her keyboard slightly 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.570
 can configure 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.060
 to go take the system control 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.860
 we reach it by means of Windows Barton and on this system control 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.649
 and we in it 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.869
 even after the fact 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 the Fed stayed here 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.220
 Keegan conjures up and we get the property 2 1 ie keyboard 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.980
 yes that's the possibility and the speed 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.750
 the two repetitions 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.970
 or at the moment probably to that of cd-rom 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.930
 in short, to put under longer 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.050
 the red ones have a text box as the whole can then spontaneously MAF 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.440
 the whole year 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.880
 Zoe imposes this on it 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.210
 PSK Wismar push down on long 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.910
 Paki the whole thing again songs on it 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.030
 stay tuned 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.750
 Landauer that longer 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.840
 is the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.640
 Repeat admission 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.800
 the whole thing is rather shy on short 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.570
 Aki the whole again 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.960
 and should that be the key again and all of those pressed 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.370
 do you see that done? 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.370
 very fast from the action time ago 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 they separate the repetition rate 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.830
 and a bit of her repeated play also change 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.920
 this means 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.180
 how long 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.460
 Uli leaps the letter 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.580
 should follow one after the other 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.870
 I have it up here 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.320
 very high so Michi letters press 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.290
 follows the very fast one behind the other »the letter 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.590
 he said Szabo for differences on low 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 under Biden letter 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.759
 and see that fits very well 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.759
 that will take a long time to see the whole lot 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.790
 repeated 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.790
 and you were not so fast then 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.840
 and the Kreis Tuttlingen map here you see this is true 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.709
 let them open it 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.049
 then always brings something that is you can so-called text that was 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.759
 Bettina the text class m 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.369
 editor 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.199
 and she could be the title in Cortina 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.079
 either on slow speed 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.079
 blind almost almost nothing 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.529
 or put on fast 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.529
 with the fast 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:48.309
 well Daumier Forte we can also have you here 7 a survey of her 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.789
 connected keyboards 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.789
 Painting should be my commitment 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.109
 ps2 means that I still go over the old connection so nothing like Boris 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.649
 b 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.989
 if you click on properties 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.989
 we can use the properties of the Stader keyboard 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:10.349
 helpless a status message about the device may exaggerate the drivers 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.349
 update or call Ribery Price 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.469
 OT about details they could have different characteristics to details Bieber 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.469
 to find out her keyboard 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.029
 what he said again with the keyboard and as said that winter the 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.559
 Control panel keyboard 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.719
 In her settings, Liebenzell had to take over and also okay 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:32.639
 give 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.639
 as the whole country has taken over 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.369
 zënter the 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.369
 Although it should be again 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.469
 to bake 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.789
 the
