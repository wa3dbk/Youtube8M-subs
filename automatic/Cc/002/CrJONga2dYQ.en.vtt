now even though both of these cartridges
show<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.250> signs<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:56.030> they<00:01:56.240> have<00:01:56.420> converters

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
show the signs that they have converters

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.069 
show the signs that they have converters
like<00:01:57.259> I<00:01:57.409> said<00:01:57.649> only<00:01:58.040> one<00:01:58.250> does<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.939> that's<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
like I said only one does and that's the

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.870 
like I said only one does and that's the
truth<00:02:00.320> with<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:00.950> very<00:02:01.220> difficult<00:02:01.700> to

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
truth with this it's very difficult to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.060 
truth with this it's very difficult to
tell<00:02:02.350> supposedly<00:02:03.350> there<00:02:03.530> are<00:02:03.619> people<00:02:03.950> out

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
tell supposedly there are people out

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.740 
tell supposedly there are people out
there<00:02:04.100> who<00:02:04.460> can<00:02:04.640> actually<00:02:05.000> pick<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> cartridge

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
there who can actually pick a cartridge

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.179 
there who can actually pick a cartridge
up<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.170> tell<00:02:06.380> which<00:02:06.619> ones<00:02:06.860> have<00:02:07.039> the

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
up and tell which ones have the

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.160 
up and tell which ones have the
converter<00:02:07.549> just<00:02:08.030> by<00:02:08.239> weighing<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.019> their

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
converter just by weighing it in their

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.210 
converter just by weighing it in their
hands<00:02:09.619> which<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.130> can't<00:02:10.489> really<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:11.060> here<00:02:12.220> most

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
hands which I can't really do here most

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.160 
hands which I can't really do here most
of<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.519> weight<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.940> cartridge<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:14.780> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
of the weight of the cartridge is at the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.259 
of the weight of the cartridge is at the
bottom<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.130> you're<00:02:16.489> supposed<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.910> be<00:02:17.030> able<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
bottom so you're supposed to be able to

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.699 
bottom so you're supposed to be able to
balance<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.900> your<00:02:18.050> fingertips<00:02:18.560> or

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
balance it in your fingertips or

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.680 
balance it in your fingertips or
something<00:02:19.069> but<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.280> can't<00:02:19.670> really<00:02:19.880> do<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.209> so

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
something but I can't really do that so

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.350 
something but I can't really do that so
I<00:02:21.110> don't<00:02:21.290> rely<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.220> if<00:02:22.459> you're<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.300> to

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
I don't rely on that if you're going to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.150 
I don't rely on that if you're going to
look<00:02:23.540> for<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.200> look<00:02:24.410> for<00:02:24.590> specific

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
look for this just look for specific

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.090 
look for this just look for specific
games<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.299> make<00:02:27.260> sure<00:02:27.410> they<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.620> five<00:02:27.799> screw

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
games and make sure they have five screw

slot at the bottom where the pins are it
looks<00:02:33.980> slightly<00:02:34.430> different<00:02:34.730> between<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.600> two

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
looks slightly different between the two

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.610 
looks slightly different between the two
and<00:02:36.080> I'll<00:02:36.410> show<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.620> what<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.860> mean<00:02:37.040> right<00:02:37.310> here

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
and I'll show you what I mean right here

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.110 
and I'll show you what I mean right here
look<00:02:39.620> right<00:02:39.860> here<00:02:40.069> at<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.400> picture<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
look right here at this picture and

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.670 
look right here at this picture and
you'll<00:02:41.360> see<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.959> if<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.230> were<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.440> draw<00:02:42.620> a

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
you'll see that if you were to draw a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.680 
you'll see that if you were to draw a
line<00:02:42.769> down<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.280> middle<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.670> pin<00:02:43.940> there's<00:02:44.630> a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
line down the middle a pin there's a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.680 
line down the middle a pin there's a
weird<00:02:45.019> bump<00:02:45.380> on<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.040> right-hand<00:02:46.670> side<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
weird bump on the right-hand side of the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.170 
weird bump on the right-hand side of the
pin<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.110> doesn't<00:02:48.410> exist<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.950> left<00:02:49.280> now

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
pin that doesn't exist on the left now

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.150 
pin that doesn't exist on the left now
from<00:02:50.540> what<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.690> understand<00:02:51.140> most<00:02:51.590> converters

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
from what I understand most converters

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.599 
from what I understand most converters
have<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.670> page<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.390> if<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.690> look<00:02:53.900> here

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
have this page here and if you look here

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.460 
have this page here and if you look here
this<00:02:55.609> cartridge<00:02:56.090> doesn't<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.200> adapter

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
this cartridge doesn't have the adapter

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.560 
this cartridge doesn't have the adapter
and<00:02:57.920> you'll<00:02:58.340> notice<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.910> doesn't<00:02:58.940> have<00:02:59.390> those

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
and you'll notice it doesn't have those

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.720 
and you'll notice it doesn't have those
weird<00:02:59.900> bumps<00:03:00.140> if<00:03:00.829> you<00:03:01.100> were<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> draw<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.519> line

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
weird bumps if you were to draw a line

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.580 
weird bumps if you were to draw a line
down<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.970> middle<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.420> pin<00:03:02.660> it'd<00:03:03.440> be

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
down the middle the pin it'd be

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.370 
down the middle the pin it'd be
perfectly<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.310> same<00:03:04.579> on<00:03:04.850> either<00:03:05.000> side<00:03:05.359> so<00:03:05.630> now

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
perfectly the same on either side so now

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.569 
perfectly the same on either side so now
that<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.650> know<00:03:06.680> what<00:03:06.950> you're<00:03:07.100> looking<00:03:07.220> for

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
that you know what you're looking for

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.819 
that you know what you're looking for
let's<00:03:07.850> crack<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.180> cartridge<00:03:09.049> open<00:03:09.470> here<00:03:09.709> and

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
let's crack a cartridge open here and

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.430 
let's crack a cartridge open here and
look<00:03:10.370> at<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.730> converter<00:03:11.180> like<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:12.019> said<00:03:12.260> you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
look at the converter like I said you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.020 
look at the converter like I said you
can<00:03:12.590> open<00:03:12.890> these<00:03:12.980> with<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.250> tiny<00:03:13.549> flat

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
can open these with a tiny flat

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.870 
can open these with a tiny flat
screwdriver

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
screwdriver

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.630 
screwdriver
and<00:03:16.240> here<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.960> go<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.860> got<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> pinky<00:03:18.430> murder

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
and here you go you got the pinky murder

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.190 
and here you go you got the pinky murder
in<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.910> middle<00:03:19.150> that's<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.540> black<00:03:19.750> thing<00:03:20.020> on

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
in the middle that's the black thing on

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.040 
in the middle that's the black thing on
the<00:03:20.680> bottom<00:03:20.830> you've<00:03:21.160> got<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.640> 30-pin<00:03:22.210> 272<00:03:22.840> pin

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
the bottom you've got the 30-pin 272 pin

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.040 
the bottom you've got the 30-pin 272 pin
converter<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.460> on<00:03:24.760> top<00:03:25.060> those<00:03:25.480> two<00:03:25.750> little

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
converter and on top those two little

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.950 
converter and on top those two little
black<00:03:26.260> glob<00:03:26.560> top<00:03:26.770> chips<00:03:27.160> are<00:03:27.490> actually

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
black glob top chips are actually

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.460 
black glob top chips are actually
gyromite<00:03:30.600> there<00:03:31.600> are<00:03:31.720> two<00:03:31.870> screws<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.440> either

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
gyromite there are two screws on either

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.160 
gyromite there are two screws on either
side<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.580> black<00:03:33.790> connector<00:03:34.300> once<00:03:34.930> you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
side of the black connector once you

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.470 
side of the black connector once you
take<00:03:35.470> those<00:03:35.650> out<00:03:35.830> this<00:03:36.370> should<00:03:36.640> just<00:03:36.670> lift<00:03:37.180> out

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
take those out this should just lift out

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.470 
take those out this should just lift out
