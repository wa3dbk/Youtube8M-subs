00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.229 
in a camera see if I did a better job
here<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.269> can<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:23.560> where<00:02:23.799> it's<00:02:23.920> kind<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.250> you

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
here you can see where it's kind of you

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.910 
here you can see where it's kind of you
can<00:02:25.390> spot<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> piece<00:02:26.019> right<00:02:26.230> there<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:26.769> that's

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
can spot a piece right there but that's

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.699 
can spot a piece right there but that's
that's<00:02:27.220> really<00:02:27.519> some<00:02:27.850> bad<00:02:28.030> algae<00:02:28.570> issues<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:29.380> I

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
that's really some bad algae issues so I

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.800 
that's really some bad algae issues so I
mean<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> only<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.209> can<00:02:31.329> really<00:02:31.420> do<00:02:31.660> is

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
mean the only thing I can really do is

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.479 
mean the only thing I can really do is
just<00:02:31.959> let<00:02:32.109> it<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:32.410> go<00:02:32.560> its<00:02:32.890> course<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.489> and

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
just let it just go its course and and

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.289 
just let it just go its course and and
it<00:02:36.640> will<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:38.640> I'm<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.820> really<00:02:39.970> sure<00:02:40.150> what's

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
it will so I'm not really sure what's

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.310 
it will so I'm not really sure what's
gonna<00:02:40.390> happen<00:02:40.780> there<00:02:40.900> I'm<00:02:41.049> not<00:02:41.200> really

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
gonna happen there I'm not really

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.830 
gonna happen there I'm not really
excited<00:02:41.799> about<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.190> but<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.640> know<00:02:42.790> time<00:02:43.690> will

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
excited about it but you know time will

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.949 
excited about it but you know time will
tell<00:02:44.109> look<00:02:44.980> its<00:02:45.269> eyes<00:02:46.269> are<00:02:46.480> no<00:02:46.570> longer<00:02:46.750> yellow

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
discus tank and put in a lot of branches

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.490 
discus tank and put in a lot of branches
and<00:03:23.120> dropped<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.269> down<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.659> tank<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.319> then

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
and dropped it down in the tank and then

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.110 
and dropped it down in the tank and then
the<00:03:25.709> fish<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.189> feel<00:03:26.400> comfortable<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:27.090> I

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
the fish just feel comfortable and I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.059 
the fish just feel comfortable and I
kind<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.510> weave<00:03:27.659> in<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:27.959> out<00:03:28.079> of<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.439> so<00:03:28.829> I

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
kind of weave in and out of that so I

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.220 
kind of weave in and out of that so I
don't<00:03:29.879> know<00:03:29.939> I<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:30.930> thought<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.109> was

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
don't know I just thought it was

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.190 
don't know I just thought it was
interesting<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:32.569> if<00:03:33.569> I<00:03:33.689> can<00:03:33.840> show<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.079> oh

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
interesting the if I can show you oh

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.569 
interesting the if I can show you oh
yeah<00:03:34.469> right<00:03:34.859> there<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:36.930> moved<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.579> twig

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
yeah right there so I moved the twig

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.059 
yeah right there so I moved the twig
catfish<00:03:39.180> back<00:03:39.569> in<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.870> tank<00:03:40.109> I'm<00:03:40.560> trying<00:03:40.950> to

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
catfish back in the tank I'm trying to

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.619 
catfish back in the tank I'm trying to
get<00:03:41.359> that

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
get that

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.050 
get that
rikiya<00:03:43.290> flutings<00:03:43.829> right<00:03:44.099> there<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.489> hold<00:03:44.730> and

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
rikiya flutings right there to hold and

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.729 
rikiya flutings right there to hold and
I<00:03:45.120> think<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.480> will<00:03:45.599> because<00:03:45.989> it's<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.319> high<00:03:46.530> up

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
I think it will because it's so high up

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.009 
I think it will because it's so high up
near<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.099> bright<00:03:47.340> light<00:03:47.579> but<00:03:48.510> if<00:03:48.599> I<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.900> get

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
near the bright light but if I can get

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.849 
near the bright light but if I can get
that<00:03:49.170> Ric<00:03:49.379> you<00:03:49.530> lose<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:51.810> grow<00:03:52.170> out<00:03:52.409> on<00:03:52.650> this

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
that Ric you lose to to grow out on this

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.330 
that Ric you lose to to grow out on this
part<00:03:53.189> of<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.430> log<00:03:53.810> that<00:03:54.810> would<00:03:55.079> Rock<00:03:55.340> so

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
part of that log that would Rock so

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.490 
part of that log that would Rock so
that's<00:03:57.269> kind<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.510> what<00:03:57.629> I'm<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:57.900> for<00:03:58.019> then

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that's kind of what I'm going for then

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.280
