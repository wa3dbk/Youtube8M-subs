description below and today we've got

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.070 
description below and today we've got
the<00:00:26.519> earthquake<00:00:26.880> spell<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.779> gather

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the earthquake spell so what I gather

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.470 
the earthquake spell so what I gather
the<00:00:28.439> earthquake<00:00:28.890> spell<00:00:29.189> does<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the earthquake spell does is that it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600 
the earthquake spell does is that it
takes<00:00:30.720> away<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> percentage<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.130> building's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
takes away a percentage of a building's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
takes away a percentage of a building's
remaining<00:00:33.120> health<00:00:33.420> points<00:00:34.550> away<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
remaining health points away so if the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.069 
remaining health points away so if the
building<00:00:37.559> has<00:00:38.000> 11,000<00:00:39.000> hit<00:00:39.210> points<00:00:39.660> it'll

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
building has 11,000 hit points it'll

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.440 
building has 11,000 hit points it'll
take<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:41.040> don't<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> percentage<00:00:41.850> per<00:00:42.210> se

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
take we don't know the percentage per se

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.330 
take we don't know the percentage per se
yet<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.020> safe<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.410> 10%<00:00:43.850> it'll<00:00:44.850> take<00:00:45.149> away

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
yet but safe it's 10% it'll take away

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.529 
yet but safe it's 10% it'll take away
1100<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.500> I'm<00:00:49.500> guessing<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.700> it'll<00:00:51.420> be

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
1100 so I'm guessing that the it'll be

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.619 
1100 so I'm guessing that the it'll be
certain<00:00:51.930> percentage<00:00:52.350> per<00:00:52.800> level<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.239> we've

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
certain percentage per level and we've

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
certain percentage per level and we've
just<00:00:54.899> got<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> upgrade<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> spell<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> get

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
just got to upgrade the spell to get

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
just got to upgrade the spell to get
more<00:00:56.520> percentage<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.300> believe<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.050> spell<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
more percentage I believe this spell is

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.939 
more percentage I believe this spell is
much<00:00:59.370> better<00:00:59.699> as<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.180> opener<00:01:00.660> spell<00:01:01.170> rather

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
much better as an opener spell rather

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160 
much better as an opener spell rather
than<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> closing<00:01:02.460> spell<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.600> other<00:01:03.809> big
