00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
easier to treat so I think a deity

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.690 
easier to treat so I think a deity
awareness<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> key<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.439> 76<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
awareness is the key thing I'm 76 and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
awareness is the key thing I'm 76 and
I've<00:01:57.060> gone<00:01:57.270> through<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.930> prostate<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
I've gone through the prostate in the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.889 
I've gone through the prostate in the
stroke<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> stance<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.780> stuff

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
stroke and the stance and all that stuff

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.719 
stroke and the stance and all that stuff
and<00:02:01.500> I'm<00:02:01.590> still<00:02:01.799> kicking<00:02:01.979> part<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and I'm still kicking part of that is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:13.699 
and I'm still kicking part of that is
awareness<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.750> part<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.259> luck

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.979 

men<00:02:14.709> are<00:02:15.069> able<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:16.450> really<00:02:16.630> row<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
men are able to really really row the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.479 
men are able to really really row the
most<00:02:17.200> mass<00:02:17.470> dashes<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.069> they<00:02:18.160> call<00:02:18.340> those

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
most mass dashes and they call those

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.880 
most mass dashes and they call those
Moe's<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.150> then<00:02:19.599> women<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:20.290> call<00:02:20.500> most

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
Moe's and then women they call most

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.540 
Moe's and then women they call most
sisters<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.900> can't<00:02:23.170> really<00:02:23.230> grow<00:02:23.530> well<00:02:24.519> I

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
sisters so we can't really grow well I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.680 
sisters so we can't really grow well I
mean<00:02:24.790> some<00:02:25.150> OS<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.720> grow<00:02:25.870> much<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.450> for<00:02:28.599> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
mean some OS can grow much but for the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.150 
mean some OS can grow much but for the
