vein<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.160> Smallville<00:00:23.970> they're<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.300> early

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
vein as Smallville they're like early

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.019 
vein as Smallville they're like early
20s<00:00:25.050> characters<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.490> except<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.970> he

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
20s characters you know except that he

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.460 
20s characters you know except that he
has<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> suit<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> suit<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.320> looks

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
has a suit and the suit actually looks

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.990 
has a suit and the suit actually looks
really<00:00:28.500> cool<00:00:28.890> yeah<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.310> suit<00:00:29.490> does<00:00:29.640> look<00:00:29.820> cool

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
really cool yeah the suit does look cool

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.530 
really cool yeah the suit does look cool
and<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.420> mean<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:32.149> their<00:00:33.149> younger

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and I mean right it's their younger

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.790 
and I mean right it's their younger
characters<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> what

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
characters but I think that what

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
characters but I think that what
differentiates<00:00:35.219> us<00:00:35.610> from<00:00:35.670> Smallville's<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
differentiates us from Smallville's the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.670 
differentiates us from Smallville's the
fact<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.840> they're<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.350> beating

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
fact that they're not really beating

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.020 
fact that they're not really beating
around<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> bush<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.700> he's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
around the bush that it's not that he's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
around the bush that it's not that he's
the<00:00:39.180> flash<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.690> thought<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.950> trailer

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
the flash I thought that the trailer

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.119 
the flash I thought that the trailer
looked<00:00:41.750> decent<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.800> just

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
looked decent for what it was but I just

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
looked decent for what it was but I just
couldn't<00:00:44.340> find<00:00:44.700> myself<00:00:44.850> interested<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
couldn't find myself interested in it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.770 
couldn't find myself interested in it
and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.250> don't<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.640> why<00:00:47.850> um<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and I don't know I don't know why um and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
and I don't know I don't know why um and
I<00:00:48.899> feel<00:00:49.110> kind<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.379> bad<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
I feel kind of bad because I like the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.979 
I feel kind of bad because I like the
fact<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.329> know<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.570> trailer<00:00:51.840> they

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
fact that you know in the trailer they

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.979 
fact that you know in the trailer they
show<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.289> he's<00:00:53.390> he<00:00:54.390> interacts<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
show that he's he interacts with the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
show that he's he interacts with the
arrow<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.430> they're<00:00:56.910> gonna<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> wrong

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
under act properly and while I'm happy

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
under act properly and while I'm happy
like<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.420> said<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:19.020> hand<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.860> them

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
like I said on one hand to see them

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
like I said on one hand to see them
maybe<00:01:20.729> putting<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.030> little<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.420> effort

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
maybe putting a little bit more effort

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.039 
maybe putting a little bit more effort
into<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> TV<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:23.130> still<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> be

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
into it on the TV it's still going to be

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.330 
into it on the TV it's still going to be
the<00:01:25.049> payoffs<00:01:25.350> gonna<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.650> nothing<00:01:26.009> yeah<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the payoffs gonna be nothing yeah I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
the payoffs gonna be nothing yeah I
think<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> lost<00:01:26.970> cause<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.840> it's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
think it's a lost cause I think it's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.420 
think it's a lost cause I think it's
really<00:01:28.200> stupid<00:01:28.409> again<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.009> goes<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.189> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
really stupid again it goes back to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
really stupid again it goes back to
Gotham<00:01:29.820> you're<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.049> people
