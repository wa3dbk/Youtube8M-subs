 Russia 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.470
 Kamaz master team that was 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.130
 founded back in the eightieth year 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.950
 this is a unique team well first it

 high technology team always 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.649
 and adapt to the new rules and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.229
 when even the motors become less speed 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.049
 KamAZ not decreased and well, of course 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.009
 probably the main advantage of this team is that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.920
