00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.910 
we're gonna follow that up with is the
notes<00:02:39.970> dnc<00:02:40.630> play<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.320> B<00:02:41.500> string<00:02:41.560> so

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
notes dnc play it on the B string so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.140 
notes dnc play it on the B string so
that's<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.190> 15th<00:02:42.549> fret<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.410> 13th<00:02:44.739> fret

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
that's the 15th fret and the 13th fret

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.280

you'll<00:02:52.650> notice<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.280> finish<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.060> phrase

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
you'll notice that you finish the phrase

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.870 
you'll notice that you finish the phrase
with<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> downstroke<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:56.220> way<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.400> started<00:02:56.730> it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
with a downstroke the way you started it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
what we want to do with that last down

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.140 
what we want to do with that last down
stroke<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.740> want<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.980> carry<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.850> through

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
stroke we want to carry that through

this<00:03:00.330> as<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> technique<00:03:00.810> commonly<00:03:00.990> referred<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
this as a technique commonly referred to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.930 
this as a technique commonly referred to
as<00:03:01.530> economy<00:03:02.040> picking<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.550> think<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.850> as

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
as economy picking I can think of it as

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.020 
as economy picking I can think of it as
a<00:03:02.970> little<00:03:03.240> sweep<00:03:03.890> because<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> next<00:03:05.310> grouping

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
a little sweep because the next grouping

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.410 
a little sweep because the next grouping
of<00:03:06.150> five<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.690> gonna<00:03:06.990> be<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:08.280> same<00:03:08.490> scale<00:03:09.210> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
of five is gonna be the same scale the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.910 
of five is gonna be the same scale the
pentatonic<00:03:09.750> scale<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.260> time<00:03:10.500> starting

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
pentatonic scale but this time starting

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.410 
pentatonic scale but this time starting
on<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.490> G<00:03:11.670> note<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.390> we're<00:03:12.480> gonna<00:03:12.570> play<00:03:12.780> down<00:03:12.930> G

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
on the G note so we're gonna play down G

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:24.710

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
picking for those two sections they're

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:49.130 
picking for those two sections they're
the<00:03:40.920> first<00:03:41.040> five<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:48.030> notice<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.930> when<00:03:49.110> I

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
the first five you notice that when I

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.290 
the first five you notice that when I
transfer<00:03:49.709> between<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.100> two<00:03:50.310> shapes<00:03:50.640> I'm<00:03:50.910> just

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
transfer between the two shapes I'm just

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.350 
transfer between the two shapes I'm just
carrying<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.750> down<00:03:52.500> stroke<00:03:53.090> across<00:03:54.090> so

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
carrying that down stroke across so

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.610 
carrying that down stroke across so
instead<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.630> there<00:03:54.810> being<00:03:54.959> two<00:03:55.110> groupings<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
instead of there being two groupings of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.949 
instead of there being two groupings of
five<00:03:55.799> pictures<00:03:56.040> which<00:03:56.340> would<00:03:56.489> give<00:03:56.640> us<00:03:56.760> ten<00:03:57.299> so

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
five pictures which would give us ten so

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.600 
five pictures which would give us ten so
I've<00:03:58.200> actually<00:03:58.290> only<00:03:58.470> got<00:03:58.739> nine<00:03:58.980> strokes<00:03:59.400> have

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
I've actually only got nine strokes have

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.250 
I've actually only got nine strokes have
a<00:03:59.640> look

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
a look

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
pentatonic scale until we get to the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.320 
pentatonic scale until we get to the
note<00:05:17.860> D<00:05:18.160> instead<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.640> playing<00:05:18.790> D<00:05:19.030> we're<00:05:19.240> gonna

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
note D instead of playing D we're gonna

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.180 
note D instead of playing D we're gonna
play<00:05:19.570> in<00:05:19.660> English<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:21.930> so<00:05:22.930> that<00:05:23.200> last<00:05:23.530> phrase

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
play in English so so that last phrase

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.320 
play in English so so that last phrase
the<00:05:24.580> two<00:05:24.730> groups<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:25.030> five

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.529 

again<00:05:31.259> we've<00:05:31.440> got<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.819> melodic<00:05:32.819> idea<00:05:33.360> using

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
again we've got that melodic idea using

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.809 
again we've got that melodic idea using
the<00:05:33.780> ninth<00:05:34.020> which<00:05:34.289> kind<00:05:34.560> of<00:05:34.620> sweetens<00:05:35.520> up<00:05:35.669> the

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
the ninth which kind of sweetens up the

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.219 
the ninth which kind of sweetens up the
sound<00:05:36.030> of<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.180> pentatonic<00:05:36.539> scale<00:05:36.990> I<00:05:37.020> think

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
sound of the pentatonic scale I think

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.499 
sound of the pentatonic scale I think
takes<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.590> out<00:05:37.680> of<00:05:37.830> cliche<00:05:38.310> territory<00:05:38.879> and<00:05:39.150> to

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
takes it out of cliche territory and to

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.719 
takes it out of cliche territory and to
finish<00:05:39.750> all<00:05:39.990> we<00:05:40.139> have<00:05:40.259> to<00:05:40.409> do<00:05:40.530> is<00:05:40.770> grab<00:05:41.550> the

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
finish all we have to do is grab the

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.430 
finish all we have to do is grab the

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
13th fret on the B string and bend it by

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.540
