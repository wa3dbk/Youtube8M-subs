00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
let's check them out

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.410 
let's check them out
first<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.480> all<00:00:15.920> wait<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> Lumias<00:00:18.779> may<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
first of all wait the Lumias may be a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.750 
first of all wait the Lumias may be a
little<00:00:21.420> bit<00:00:21.630> lighter<00:00:21.930> than<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> iphone<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
little bit lighter than the iphone the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.250 
little bit lighter than the iphone the
reason<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.300> iPhone<00:00:24.630> has<00:00:24.750> glass<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
reason is the iPhone has glass in the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.720 
reason is the iPhone has glass in the
front<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.769> back<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.279> makes<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.670> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
front and on the back just makes it a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.540 
front and on the back just makes it a
little<00:00:26.910> bit<00:00:27.090> heavier<00:00:27.480> than<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.840> Lumia<00:00:28.550> then

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
little bit heavier than the Lumia then

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.170 
little bit heavier than the Lumia then
let's<00:00:30.029> compare<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> size<00:00:31.610> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
let's compare the size you can see the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.110 
let's compare the size you can see the
new<00:00:33.329> Nokia<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> little<00:00:34.260> bit<00:00:34.440> higher<00:00:35.809> and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
new Nokia is a little bit higher and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.250 
new Nokia is a little bit higher and
it's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.480> bit<00:00:40.579> wider<00:00:41.579> than<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> iPhone

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it's a little bit wider than the iPhone

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.470 
it's a little bit wider than the iPhone
and<00:00:45.920> thickness<00:00:47.149> we<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.180> feel<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.960> goes<00:00:49.440> uphill

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
and thickness we can feel it goes uphill

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.590 
and thickness we can feel it goes uphill
and<00:00:51.480> let's<00:00:52.379> check<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> profile<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.390> can

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and let's check out the profile you can

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170
