00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
show the car off a little bit cars a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.390 
show the car off a little bit cars a
little<00:00:25.110> bit<00:00:25.320> dusty<00:00:25.650> because<00:00:26.100> it's<00:00:26.250> been

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
little bit dusty because it's been

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.760 
little bit dusty because it's been
sitting<00:00:26.610> inside<00:00:26.850> all<00:00:27.090> winter<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.840> don't

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
sitting inside all winter and I don't

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.500 
sitting inside all winter and I don't
really<00:00:29.010> believe<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.400> car<00:00:29.609> covers<00:00:30.029> sometimes<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
really believe in car covers sometimes I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.790 
really believe in car covers sometimes I
think<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.050> more<00:00:31.199> damage<00:00:31.410> than<00:00:31.619> good

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
think they can do more damage than good

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
think they can do more damage than good
so<00:00:32.669> anyway<00:00:32.970> we'll<00:00:33.150> take<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.330> look<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> car

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989

good I'm thinking that's pretty hard to
do<00:03:30.860> really<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.720> things<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.200> c4<00:03:33.440> Corvettes

like<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:57.860> one<00:03:58.010> right<00:03:58.190> here<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:58.989> just<00:03:59.989> reworked

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
like this one right here I just reworked

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.930 
like this one right here I just reworked
that<00:04:00.650> one<00:04:00.860> with<00:04:01.040> some<00:04:01.190> black<00:04:01.340> silicone

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
that one with some black silicone

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.610 
that one with some black silicone
because<00:04:02.299> this<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.720> nice<00:04:02.959> soft<00:04:03.319> weather

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
because this is a nice soft weather

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.100 
because this is a nice soft weather
strip<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:05.150> can't<00:04:05.390> even<00:04:05.540> buy<00:04:05.810> them<00:04:05.900> like

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
strip and you can't even buy them like

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.910 
strip and you can't even buy them like
that<00:04:06.290> anymore

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
that anymore

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.430 
that anymore
the<00:04:07.069> only<00:04:07.280> ones<00:04:07.519> there<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:08.599> way<00:04:09.110> would<00:04:09.410> be

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
the only ones there that way would be

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.069 
the only ones there that way would be
new<00:04:09.769> old<00:04:09.980> stock<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:11.060> those<00:04:11.329> parts<00:04:11.780> are<00:04:11.900> gonna

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
new old stock and those parts are gonna

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.280 
new old stock and those parts are gonna
be<00:04:12.290> over<00:04:13.130> 20<00:04:13.459> years<00:04:13.670> old<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.750> chance<00:04:15.079> of

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
be over 20 years old so the chance of

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.590 
be over 20 years old so the chance of
getting<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.650> good<00:04:15.799> one<00:04:15.950> for<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.479> even<00:04:17.479> as

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
getting a good one for that even as

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.409 
getting a good one for that even as
somewhat<00:04:18.019> limited<00:04:18.380> as<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.489> power<00:04:19.760> antenna<00:04:20.180> that

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
somewhat limited as a power antenna that

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.409 
somewhat limited as a power antenna that
still<00:04:20.690> works<00:04:21.640> everything<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.940> my<00:04:23.150> knowledge

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
still works everything to my knowledge

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.830 
still works everything to my knowledge
on<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.229> car<00:04:24.530> does<00:04:25.100> work<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:29.390> works<00:04:29.570> pretty

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
on the car does work and it works pretty

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.190 
on the car does work and it works pretty
well<00:04:29.990> too<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:31.789> only<00:04:32.000> code<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.479> gets<00:04:32.630> set<00:04:32.990> is

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
well too the only code that gets set is

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.960 
well too the only code that gets set is
a<00:04:33.229> code<00:04:33.680> 32<00:04:34.100> for<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:35.200> EGR<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.710> that's<00:04:36.970> exhaust

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
a code 32 for a EGR and that's exhaust

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
maybe make that go away and I'll

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.580 
maybe make that go away and I'll
probably<00:05:08.180> continue<00:05:08.360> tinker<00:05:09.020> with<00:05:09.289> that<00:05:09.440> and

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
probably continue tinker with that and

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.860 
probably continue tinker with that and
work<00:05:09.740> on<00:05:09.919> it<00:05:10.039> but<00:05:10.160> it's<00:05:11.090> been<00:05:11.300> doing<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.720> I'm

in<00:06:05.459> here<00:06:05.729> usually<00:06:05.969> a<00:06:06.179> look<00:06:06.449> at<00:06:06.569> them<00:06:06.689> and

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
in here usually a look at them and

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:08.649 
in here usually a look at them and
they'll<00:06:06.899> be<00:06:07.019> worn<00:06:07.319> and<00:06:07.559> have<00:06:08.009> holes<00:06:08.279> in<00:06:08.519> them
