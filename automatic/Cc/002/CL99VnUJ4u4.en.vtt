double sided so you have one camera

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.170 
double sided so you have one camera
right<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.300> top<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.440> back<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.460> if

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
right up top and one in the back so if

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.209 
right up top and one in the back so if
you<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> change<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.739> see

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you want to change it so you can see

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.970

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
it'll be much more easier to see

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.600
