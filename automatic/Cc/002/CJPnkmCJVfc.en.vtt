00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.239
 I was talking to you at a while ago about the giant spider promo 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.380
 the aftertaste that will have to walk in the room we will talk 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.389
 now to my conleau friends this is a robot the surgeon called is 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.709
 used for four years in fifteen breeds to watch in front of 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.609
 self I think by the armp 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.310
 gold at the end the surgeon 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.930
 no one does indeed have the operating room man no I reassure you one does not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.220
 noted a cardboard on asia he is replaced the man by the machine 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.550
 in fact it is a robot that is remotely controlled by the surgeon he is 

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:32.640
 especially used in reconstructive surgery to access 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.820
 difficult areas 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.060
 as for the removal of the prostate nasser attended at 7 o'clock 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.490
 intervention with a cream attention some pictures may shock 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.970
 this robotic octopus priced by waiting for its tentacles 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.370
 he must undergo a removal of the prostate 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.950
 the head thinks of the octopus and if that surgeon who commands the arms of the 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.120
 robot with tourists were leaving the extension of my arm because 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.990
 technically if I had to go to 11 places where I currently live thanks 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.679
 to the robot 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.800
 I would have a lot of difficulties 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.110
 I can make much finer gestures much more precise and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.930
 mostly filtered even though I saw a lot of coffee and I tremble the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.780
 rebound 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.340
 these first movements and allow me to make a gesture perfectly 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.170
 stable 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.050
 3d vision 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.750
 the dump is open a few small incisions are enough 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.420
 that's where the opera traore introduces a camera and spend a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.660
 half a meter 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.470
 this precision helps preserve the function the rice nerica victims of the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.490
 patient 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.899
 not to reopen the abdominal wall 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.660
 we recover faster to less parietal pain 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.280
 there is less bleeding heller the robot near but can make some 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.010
 gestures 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.600
 without traumatizing adjacent organs 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.120
 so it will be queen to healing 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.960
 in four years the surgeons at the clinic have achieved nearly 650 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.640
 interventions with the robot 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.409
 mostly used in urology at the beginning it applies today to others 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.490
 specialties 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.980
 now for 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.310
 our friends our mistakes 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.510
 the use of the word politics 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.819
 and when brain 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.039
 of the pharynx 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.999
 Joan of Arc and the 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.490
 for some cancers 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.959
 cervix 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.449
 but some endometrial cancers 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.699
 he found the name of this technology if its cost is estimated at 1 million 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.800
 700 thousand euros 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.090
 despite this investment, it is difficult to profitably quarantine 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.320
 of establishments are equipped in France the robotic octopus deploys 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.929
 his tentacles slowly 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:33.859
 20% of prostate ablations are performed in the Congo in France against 80% 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.609
 in the USA 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.819
 so this is a technique it is developing apparently slowly then 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.419
 it is a pickaxe a real success in April-May laurent the nerve of the war 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.889
 it's money 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.379
 among the interventions like the one we just saw in the report 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.269
 ablation of prostate robots 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.390
 it costs about one thousand two hundred thousand 500 jobs with surgery 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.799
 classic is three times cheaper so the robot is expensive 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:00.349
 when you buy it is expensive to maintain and use it is 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.919
 which brakes a lot of health facilities and to equip important thing 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.989
 this is not the patient who bear the extra cost of this technology with 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.340
 nicolas too 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.889
 for us it does not change anything that is the classic method to the small 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.229
 the street you will play for the occasion in total with this robot of the poles 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.019
 sometimes very hard Tuesday 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.099
 I present to you my first patient would be appealed 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.979
 that's then 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.510
 laurent equip yourself 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.889
 parents of pupils 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.399
 It is totally true 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:31.429
 the parents of the woman then on the head quite arsenal the stamp of 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:32.139
 the bruch 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.529
 know that in France there is only a university degree in surgery 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:36.830
 robotics is in Nancy 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.690
 otherwise you had to go to the clinics in the hospitals that's what 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.539
 we did in the clinic in Harare 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.239
 make it abroad 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.149
 you will understand why 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.579
 doctor erard today I'm losing my first answer what do I 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.360
 start by doing 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.969
 he first of all you have hoof appointments 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.589
 you are bad at refusing to become one with the machine must know that 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.389
 it was the manipulators and 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.679
 the continuation duchesneau comes in the second inning go approached you 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.449
 were in the console to see in three dimensions 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.859
 and thirdly you put your hands in each case is unique 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.909
 to be able to control 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.939
 the instruments you have the opportunity offered to make some 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:16.859
 movements 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.459
 you could not do 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.749
 on the other hand open roger for example 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:25.219
 first because you are limited and sometimes your shoulder by 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.529
 your wrist 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.539
 the surgeons the new consoles 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.669
 with sponges with pacifiers with small specimens 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.699
 on the sly 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.240
 simply to 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.680
 the regulars 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.569
 to manipulation 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.569
 messi especially gathered the tip of china 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.860
 conducted in the first 24 centers in France 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.460
 currently we are formatting after four air shows 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.919
 mans all over France 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:50.879
 all 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.740
 four to six weeks 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.820
 that's when I'm not hiding from you that the convalescence after a little long 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:56.660
 for my team 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.480
 in reverse of the other shows the report
