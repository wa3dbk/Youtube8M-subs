system<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:20.310> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> assemble<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.180> table

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
system I'm going to assemble the table

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.560 
system I'm going to assemble the table
in<00:02:21.750> two<00:02:21.959> halves<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:23.100> long<00:02:23.370> half<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.329> long

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
in two halves the long half and the long

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.350 
in two halves the long half and the long
half<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.200> after<00:02:25.799> those<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.160> set<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:27.209> we'll

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
half and after those have set then we'll

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.630 
half and after those have set then we'll
combine<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.780> two<00:02:28.079> halves<00:02:28.349> by<00:02:28.890> attaching<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
combine the two halves by attaching the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.440 
combine the two halves by attaching the
short<00:02:29.910> skirt<00:02:30.270> boards<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.870> between

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
short skirt boards in between

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.170 
short skirt boards in between
now<00:02:33.380> before<00:02:33.709> we<00:02:33.740> go<00:02:34.010> anything<00:02:34.490> I'm<00:02:34.819> going<00:02:35.090> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
now before we go anything I'm going to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.210 
now before we go anything I'm going to
protect<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> surrounding<00:02:36.349> areas<00:02:36.770> with

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
protect the surrounding areas with

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.790 
protect the surrounding areas with
masking<00:02:37.790> tape<00:02:37.870> because<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:39.020> we<00:02:39.140> get<00:02:39.319> any<00:02:39.470> glue

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
masking tape because if we get any glue

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.940 
masking tape because if we get any glue
on<00:02:40.099> unwanted<00:02:40.970> areas<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:42.200> going<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.620> affect

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
on unwanted areas it's going to affect

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.640 
on unwanted areas it's going to affect
the<00:02:43.069> way<00:02:43.099> they<00:02:43.370> finish<00:02:43.670> absorbs<00:02:44.410> it's<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.500> good

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
the way they finish absorbs it's a good

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.020 
the way they finish absorbs it's a good
idea<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.069> make<00:02:46.220> sure<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.489> have<00:02:46.610> everything

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
idea to make sure you have everything

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.949 
idea to make sure you have everything
you<00:02:47.330> need<00:02:47.360> before<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.319> start<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.860> glue<00:02:49.010> up

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
you need before you start the glue up

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.500 
you need before you start the glue up
because<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.080> have<00:02:51.170> about<00:02:51.410> five<00:02:51.770> minutes<00:02:52.040> of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
because you have about five minutes of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.970 
because you have about five minutes of
open<00:02:53.510> working<00:02:53.900> time<00:02:54.110> with<00:02:54.350> typical<00:02:54.800> yellow

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
open working time with typical yellow

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.940 
open working time with typical yellow
glue<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:57.190> find<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.310> using<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.760> foam<00:02:59.000> brush<00:02:59.269> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
glue I find that using a foam brush to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.729 
glue I find that using a foam brush to
put<00:03:00.950> glue<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.459> mortises<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:03.260> an<00:03:03.440> easy

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
put glue in the mortises is an easy

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.890 
put glue in the mortises is an easy
method<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:05.030> don't<00:03:05.239> need<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.420> whole<00:03:05.630> lot<00:03:05.660> of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
method and you don't need a whole lot of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.440 
method and you don't need a whole lot of
glue<00:03:06.370> especially<00:03:07.370> because<00:03:07.550> these<00:03:07.910> joints

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
glue especially because these joints

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.920 
glue especially because these joints
have<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.140> pre-drilled<00:03:09.769> pocket<00:03:10.310> hole<00:03:10.930> that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
have that pre-drilled pocket hole that

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.520 
have that pre-drilled pocket hole that
will<00:03:12.140> allow<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.650> drive<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> screw<00:03:14.530> through

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
will allow you to drive a screw through

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.590 
will allow you to drive a screw through
the<00:03:15.560> skirt<00:03:15.920> board<00:03:16.250> into<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:16.970> leg

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
the skirt board into the leg

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.330 
the skirt board into the leg
thus<00:03:17.930> locking<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.500> tenon<00:03:18.860> in<00:03:19.010> place<00:03:21.069> so<00:03:22.069> after

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
thus locking the tenon in place so after

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.800 
thus locking the tenon in place so after
you<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:22.459> glue<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.060> mortise<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:24.560> insert

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
you have glue in the mortise just insert

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:34.990 
you have glue in the mortise just insert
the<00:03:26.810> tenon<00:03:27.580> press<00:03:28.580> these<00:03:28.730> two<00:03:28.970> together<00:03:34.000> we'll

the tenon press these two together we'll

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.610 
the tenon press these two together we'll
do<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.299> same<00:03:35.480> thing<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.019> other<00:03:36.049> mortise

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
do the same thing on the other mortise

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.199 
do the same thing on the other mortise
and<00:03:36.940> put<00:03:37.940> its<00:03:38.150> tenant<00:03:38.570> in<00:03:38.630> place<00:03:43.000> now<00:03:44.000> with<00:03:44.060> a

square so with the skirt board clamped

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.310 
square so with the skirt board clamped
into<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.920> leg<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.489> can<00:04:17.000> now<00:04:17.180> drive<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:17.750> screw

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
into the leg I can now drive that screw

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.830 
into the leg I can now drive that screw
that<00:04:18.890> will<00:04:19.100> lock<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.640> tenon<00:04:20.090> into<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
that will lock the tenon into the

that will lock the tenon into the
mortise

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.339 

so<00:04:31.849> there's<00:04:32.060> one<00:04:32.300> half<00:04:32.599> of<00:04:32.689> the<00:04:32.810> table<00:04:33.169> done

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
so there's one half of the table done

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.920 
so there's one half of the table done
will<00:04:33.860> do<00:04:33.979> exactly<00:04:34.159> the<00:04:34.669> same<00:04:34.699> procedure<00:04:35.090> for

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
will do exactly the same procedure for

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.839 
will do exactly the same procedure for
the<00:04:36.020> other<00:04:36.050> long<00:04:36.469> sides<00:04:36.889> and<00:04:37.129> then<00:04:37.699> we'll

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
the other long sides and then we'll

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.670 
the other long sides and then we'll
connect<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.330> two<00:04:38.479> halves<00:04:38.750> now<00:04:39.319> that<00:04:39.469> we<00:04:39.560> have

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
connect the two halves now that we have

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.740 
connect the two halves now that we have
the<00:04:39.800> two<00:04:39.949> long<00:04:40.219> sides<00:04:40.550> done<00:04:40.849> it's<00:04:41.330> time<00:04:41.629> to

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
the two long sides done it's time to

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.719 
the two long sides done it's time to
connect<00:04:42.080> those<00:04:42.259> using<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.039> shorter<00:04:43.430> skirt

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
connect those using the shorter skirt
