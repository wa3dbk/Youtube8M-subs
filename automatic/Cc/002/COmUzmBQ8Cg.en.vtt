00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.819 

in<00:00:00.570> today's<00:00:01.050> video<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.740> be

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
in today's video we're going to be

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.730 
in today's video we're going to be
discussing<00:00:02.190> myoglobin<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:04.290> previous

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
discussing myoglobin in the previous

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.579 
discussing myoglobin in the previous
video<00:00:05.069> we<00:00:05.130> were<00:00:05.730> talking<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.600> hemoglobin

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
video we were talking about hemoglobin

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.400 
video we were talking about hemoglobin
so<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.970> kind<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.660> similar<00:00:09.900> they<00:00:10.260> have

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
so this is kind of similar they have

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
so this is kind of similar they have
different<00:00:10.800> functions<00:00:11.250> but<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> both<00:00:11.820> heme

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
different functions but the both heme

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
different functions but the both heme
proteins<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.870> let's<00:00:13.650> just<00:00:13.860> go<00:00:13.980> into<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.460> bit

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
proteins so let's just go into in a bit

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.960 
proteins so let's just go into in a bit
more<00:00:14.790> detail<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.800> myoglobin<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.580> heme

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
more detail so myoglobin is a heme

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.590 
more detail so myoglobin is a heme
protein<00:00:18.510> which<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.170> present<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.980> heart<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
protein which is present in heart and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.080 
protein which is present in heart and
skeletal<00:00:21.600> muscle<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.289> myoglobin<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.609> present

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
skeletal muscle so myoglobin is present

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.200 
skeletal muscle so myoglobin is present
in<00:00:24.240> cardiac<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.080> skeletal<00:00:25.410> muscle<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.400> its

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
in cardiac and skeletal muscle and its

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.200 
in cardiac and skeletal muscle and its
function<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.320> act<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.740> an<00:00:29.039> oxygen<00:00:29.730> courier

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
function is to act as an oxygen courier

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.639 
function is to act as an oxygen courier
that<00:00:30.619> increases<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.130> rate<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:33.380> transport<00:00:34.380> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
that increases the rate of transport of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.040 
that increases the rate of transport of
oxygen<00:00:34.950> within<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> muscle<00:00:36.059> cell<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
oxygen within the muscle cell and it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.560 
oxygen within the muscle cell and it
acts<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> reservoir<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.190> oxygen<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.390> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
acts as a reservoir for oxygen so it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
acts as a reservoir for oxygen so it's
main<00:00:39.809> function<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> increase<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> amount

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
main function is to increase the amount

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.569 
main function is to increase the amount
of<00:00:41.579> oxygen<00:00:41.790> within<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.780> muscle<00:00:43.140> itself<00:00:43.579> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
of oxygen within the muscle itself and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.459 
of oxygen within the muscle itself and
this<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.850> highly<00:00:45.329> important<00:00:45.750> during<00:00:46.020> periods

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
this is highly important during periods

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860 
this is highly important during periods
of<00:00:46.590> exercise<00:00:47.160> where<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.239> muscles<00:00:48.570> require

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
of exercise where the muscles require

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.110 
of exercise where the muscles require
extra<00:00:49.530> oxygen<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.670> respiration<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:53.120> its

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
extra oxygen for respiration and its

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.299 
extra oxygen for respiration and its
structure<00:00:54.980> now

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
structure now

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
structure now
myoglobin<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.629> very<00:00:57.960> compact<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.149> very

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
myoglobin is very compact it's a very

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.340 
myoglobin is very compact it's a very
compact<00:01:00.780> molecule<00:01:02.449> there<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.600> eight<00:01:03.809> alpha

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
compact molecule there are eight alpha

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
compact molecule there are eight alpha
helixes<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.640> present<00:01:06.119> within<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
helixes which are present within the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
helixes which are present within the
structure<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> myoglobin<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> don't

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
structure of myoglobin and if you don't

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.560 
structure of myoglobin and if you don't
know<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:09.990> alpha<00:01:10.409> helixes<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.250> where<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
know one alpha helixes it's where if you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.039 
know one alpha helixes it's where if you
can<00:01:12.689> imagine<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.670> sequence<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> amino<00:01:14.970> acids<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
can imagine a sequence of amino acids so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.740 
can imagine a sequence of amino acids so
it's<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.409> its<00:01:16.560> secondary<00:01:17.159> structure<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it's in its secondary structure that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.830 
it's in its secondary structure that
along<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> backbone<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
along the backbone of the of the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
along the backbone of the of the
molecule<00:01:23.450> there<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:25.850> nitrogen's<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
molecule there are nitrogen's from the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
molecule there are nitrogen's from the
amino<00:01:27.810> part<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.750> amino<00:01:30.750> acid<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> there's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
amino part of the amino acid and there's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.340 
amino part of the amino acid and there's
a<00:01:31.560> carbonyl<00:01:32.070> group<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> how<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> works<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
a carbonyl group so how it works is the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.740 
a carbonyl group so how it works is the
nitrogen<00:01:34.560> donates<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.520> hydrogen<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
nitrogen donates a hydrogen to the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.859 
nitrogen donates a hydrogen to the
carbonyl<00:01:37.290> group<00:01:37.350> along<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.579> backbone<00:01:38.869> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
carbonyl group along the backbone so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.069 
carbonyl group along the backbone so
what<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.200> means<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.979> helps<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> form<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
what this means is it helps the form a

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.649 
what this means is it helps the form a
spiral<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:44.610> alpha<00:01:45.060> helix<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
spiral so this is what an alpha helix is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.139 
spiral so this is what an alpha helix is
and<00:01:45.899> within<00:01:46.740> myoglobin<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.759> eight<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and within myoglobin there are eight of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
and within myoglobin there are eight of
these<00:01:48.270> alpha<00:01:48.720> helixes<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.590> folded

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
these alpha helixes which are folded

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
these alpha helixes which are folded
together<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.579> loop<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.810> label

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
together in a loop and you can label

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.730 
together in a loop and you can label
each<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> alpha<00:01:53.280> helixes<00:01:53.759> from<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
each of the alpha helixes from a all the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
each of the alpha helixes from a all the
way<00:01:55.829> until<00:01:55.950> H<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> first<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
way until H so the first one is a the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
way until H so the first one is a the
second<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.799> B<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.399> third<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.909> C<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
second one is B the third one is C and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.190 
second one is B the third one is C and
so<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:02.240> another<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so on and another thing to know is the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.999 
so on and another thing to know is the
interior<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:05.130> myoglobin

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
interior of myoglobin

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.780 
interior of myoglobin
consists<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:09.439> nonpolar<00:02:10.439> or<00:02:10.860> hydrophobic

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
consists of nonpolar or hydrophobic

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.319 
consists of nonpolar or hydrophobic
amino<00:02:12.390> acids<00:02:13.079> and<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:15.379> surface<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.560> myoglobin

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
amino acids and the surface of myoglobin

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.449 
amino acids and the surface of myoglobin
consists<00:02:18.329> of<00:02:18.450> polar<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.470> hydrophilic<00:02:19.950> amino

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
consists of polar and hydrophilic amino

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.300 
consists of polar and hydrophilic amino
acids<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.379> this<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.590> quite<00:02:22.769> similar<00:02:23.040> to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
acids and this is quite similar to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.589 
acids and this is quite similar to
hemoglobin<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.090> well<00:02:25.879> so<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.060> inside

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
hemoglobin as well so the inside

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.410 
hemoglobin as well so the inside
consists<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.319> water-hating<00:02:28.950> amino<00:02:29.459> acids<00:02:29.909> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
consists of water-hating amino acids and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.899 
consists of water-hating amino acids and
the<00:02:30.569> outside<00:02:31.019> consists<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.909> water-loving

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
the outside consists of water-loving

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.690 
the outside consists of water-loving
amino<00:02:33.599> acids<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.859> this<00:02:35.069> helps<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.670> form<00:02:37.700> to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
amino acids so this helps it form to

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.899 
amino acids so this helps it form to
react<00:02:39.420> with<00:02:39.659> solvents<00:02:40.200> basically<00:02:40.909> now

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
react with solvents basically now

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.140 
react with solvents basically now
finally<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.870> finish<00:02:42.989> off<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.349> video

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
finally just to finish off the video

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.430 
finally just to finish off the video
we're<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.329> talk<00:02:45.510> about<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.870> finding<00:02:46.319> of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
we're going to talk about the finding of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.190 
we're going to talk about the finding of
the<00:02:46.769> heme<00:02:46.950> groups<00:02:47.250> or<00:02:47.489> how<00:02:47.609> it<00:02:47.790> actually<00:02:48.200> is

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the heme groups or how it actually is

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.649 
the heme groups or how it actually is
stable<00:02:50.099> within<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.549> myoglobin<00:02:50.849> structure

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
stable within the myoglobin structure

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.589 
stable within the myoglobin structure
the<00:02:51.810> heme<00:02:52.019> part<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:53.069> there<00:02:53.370> are<00:02:53.489> two<00:02:53.700> residues

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
the heme part so there are two residues

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.509 
the heme part so there are two residues
well<00:02:54.870> which<00:02:55.200> help<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> bind<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.069> heme<00:02:56.280> group

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
well which help to bind the heme group

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.789 
well which help to bind the heme group
so<00:02:57.150> there's<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.569> proximal<00:02:58.139> histidine

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
so there's the proximal histidine

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.360 
so there's the proximal histidine
residue<00:02:59.690> which<00:03:00.690> binds<00:03:01.170> directly<00:03:01.379> to<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> iron

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
residue which binds directly to the iron

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.030 
residue which binds directly to the iron
of<00:03:02.579> heme<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.200> there's<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.379> distal<00:03:04.859> histidine

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
of heme and there's the distal histidine

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.640 
of heme and there's the distal histidine
and<00:03:05.639> what<00:03:06.359> this<00:03:06.569> does<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.260> helps<00:03:07.409> to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and what this does is it helps to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.879 
and what this does is it helps to
stabilize<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.819> binding<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.359> oxygen<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.829> I

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
stabilize the binding of oxygen to the I

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.349 
stabilize the binding of oxygen to the I
