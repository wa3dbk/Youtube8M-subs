now<00:00:25.439> from<00:00:25.470> montreal<00:00:26.160> good<00:00:26.460> morning<00:00:26.730> good

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
now from montreal good morning good

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.009 
now from montreal good morning good
morning<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.060> tell<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
morning so first of all tell me about a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
morning so first of all tell me about a
lunar<00:00:31.859> eclipse<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:32.669> different

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
lunar eclipse and how it's different

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.910 
lunar eclipse and how it's different
from<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.300> solar<00:00:33.690> eclipse<00:00:34.110> other<00:00:34.649> than<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
from a solar eclipse other than the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.330 
from a solar eclipse other than the
obvious<00:00:36.230> well<00:00:37.230> what's<00:00:37.620> happening<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.190> all

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
obvious well what's happening it's all

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
obvious well what's happening it's all
hat<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:38.820> has<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.840> line<00:00:40.050> up

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
hat it all has to do with the line up

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
hat it all has to do with the line up
between<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.280> moon<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.969> earth<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> Sun

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
between the moon the earth and the Sun

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260 
between the moon the earth and the Sun
so<00:00:43.469> during<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> solar<00:00:44.160> eclipse<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.030> have

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
so during a solar eclipse you have

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
so during a solar eclipse you have
basically<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.260> moon<00:00:46.469> sandwiched<00:00:47.219> between

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
basically the moon sandwiched between

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.060 
basically the moon sandwiched between
the<00:00:47.670> Earth<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.600> Sun<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> lunar

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the Earth and the Sun but in the lunar

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.490 
the Earth and the Sun but in the lunar
eclipse<00:00:50.460> you've<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> earth<00:00:51.899> right

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
eclipse you've got the earth right

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
eclipse you've got the earth right
between<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.340> moon<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> Sun<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.239> they're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
between the moon and the Sun and they're

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
between the moon and the Sun and they're
in<00:00:54.510> perfect<00:00:54.809> alignment<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.010> other<00:00:56.129> thing

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
in perfect alignment and the other thing

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
in perfect alignment and the other thing
is<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.610> perfectly<00:00:57.090> safe<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> view<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> lunar

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
is it's perfectly safe to view the lunar

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
is it's perfectly safe to view the lunar
eclipse<00:00:59.010> by<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.719> there's<00:01:00.719> no<00:01:00.780> there's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
eclipse by the way there's no there's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
eclipse by the way there's no there's
it's<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.219> user-friendly<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it's very user-friendly you can use a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
it's very user-friendly you can use a
telescope<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.650> binoculars<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
telescope or binoculars if you have it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.370 
telescope or binoculars if you have it
to<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> close-up<00:01:06.390> view<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.229> it's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to get a close-up view but it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
to get a close-up view but it's
perfectly<00:01:07.830> safe<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> view<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:08.729> looking<00:01:09.119> at

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
perfectly safe to view you're looking at

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
perfectly safe to view you're looking at
reflected<00:01:09.869> sunlight<00:01:10.140> off<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> surface<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
reflected sunlight off the surface of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
reflected sunlight off the surface of
the<00:01:11.400> moon<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.570> earth<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.439> moon<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the moon and the earth the moon is

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
the moon and the earth the moon is
basically<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.460> enter<00:01:14.820> Earth's<00:01:15.000> shadow

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
basically going to enter Earth's shadow

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.390 
basically going to enter Earth's shadow
so<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.439> what's<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> cool

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
so that's what's going to be so cool

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
so that's what's going to be so cool
about<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> happen<00:01:18.840> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
about it and this is going to happen in

the overnight hours tonight into
tomorrow<00:01:20.909> morning<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.500> actually

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
tomorrow morning so what we're actually

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580 
tomorrow morning so what we're actually
looking<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> shadow<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.990> our

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
looking at is the is the shadow of our

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.999 
looking at is the is the shadow of our
planet<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> moon<00:01:27.320> yeah<00:01:28.320> exactly<00:01:28.560> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
planet on the moon yeah exactly in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.200 
planet on the moon yeah exactly in
Sheamus<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.549> what's<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.880> cool<00:01:30.150> about

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
Sheamus you know what's so cool about

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179 
Sheamus you know what's so cool about
this<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> look<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
this is that when you look at that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.580 
this is that when you look at that
shadow<00:01:32.700> creeping<00:01:33.360> across<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.079> surface<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
shadow creeping across the surface of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
shadow creeping across the surface of
the<00:01:34.680> moon<00:01:34.829> you'll<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.060> kind<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the moon you'll see that it's kind of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
the moon you'll see that it's kind of
curved<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.350> guess<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.520> curved

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
curved and guess what that's curved

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
curved and guess what that's curved
because<00:01:39.240> our<00:01:39.420> planet<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> round<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> there

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
because our planet is round and there

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980 
because our planet is round and there
you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.700> proof<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.240> fact<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.689> our

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you have it the proof the fact that our

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.560 
you have it the proof the fact that our

planet earth is round is right in front
of<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.290> neat<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.710> ancient

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
of you and it it's neat because ancient

of you and it it's neat because ancient
Greek<00:01:47.640> astronomers<00:01:48.890> notice<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.130> over<00:01:50.490> 3,000

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
Greek astronomers notice this over 3,000

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.300 
Greek astronomers notice this over 3,000
years<00:01:51.360> ago<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.020> said<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.860> proof<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
years ago and said this was proof that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
years ago and said this was proof that
our<00:01:53.340> planet<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:53.939> round<00:01:54.210> how<00:01:54.840> often<00:01:55.049> does<00:01:55.380> this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
our planet was round how often does this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.330 
our planet was round how often does this
occur<00:01:56.750> well<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.960> average<00:01:58.290> there's<00:01:58.829> about<00:01:59.009> two

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
occur well on average there's about two

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
occur well on average there's about two
lunar<00:01:59.790> eclipses<00:02:00.329> every<00:02:00.810> year<00:02:01.110> every<00:02:01.259> six

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
lunar eclipses every year every six

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
lunar eclipses every year every six
months<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.759> depends<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.270> where

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
months but it really depends on where

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.789 
months but it really depends on where
you<00:02:03.719> are<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:03.930> earth<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> be

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
you are on earth you have to be

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.459 
you are on earth you have to be
perfectly<00:02:05.250> positioned<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.329> see<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.290> last

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
perfectly positioned to see it the last

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
perfectly positioned to see it the last
one<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> course<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.489> was<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.970> February

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
one here of course is was in February

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
one here of course is was in February
2008<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.739> next<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.250> we'll<00:02:11.430> we'll<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.879> here

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
2008 the next one we'll we'll see here

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.640 
2008 the next one we'll we'll see here
in<00:02:12.150> North<00:02:12.300> America<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.020> April

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
in North America is in April

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.160 
in North America is in April
2014<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:15.549> this<00:02:15.760> was<00:02:15.939> a<00:02:15.969> pretty<00:02:16.510> special<00:02:17.049> one

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
2014 but this was a pretty special one

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.679 
2014 but this was a pretty special one
because<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.620> lands<00:02:18.069> on<00:02:18.219> the<00:02:18.579> Solstice<00:02:19.150> winter

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
because it lands on the Solstice winter

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.770 
because it lands on the Solstice winter
solstice<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.859> hasn't<00:02:21.129> happened<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.780> 372

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
solstice that hasn't happened in 372

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.349 
solstice that hasn't happened in 372
years<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.560> when<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.459> will<00:02:24.849> probably<00:02:25.239> not

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
years and when it will probably not

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.970 
years and when it will probably not
happen<00:02:25.689> again<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.109> another<00:02:26.230> three<00:02:26.739> hundred

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
happen again for another three hundred

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.910 
happen again for another three hundred
and<00:02:27.010> seventy<00:02:27.670> years<00:02:27.849> either<00:02:28.060> national<00:02:28.920> yeah

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
and seventy years either national yeah

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.009 
and seventy years either national yeah
he'll<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.609> a<00:02:30.639> long<00:02:30.879> wait<00:02:31.180> that's<00:02:31.420> for<00:02:31.629> sure<00:02:31.810> I

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
he'll have a long wait that's for sure I

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.190 
he'll have a long wait that's for sure I
did<00:02:33.120> some<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.299> pictures<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.689> I've<00:02:34.930> seen

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
did some of the pictures that I've seen

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.830 
did some of the pictures that I've seen
the<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.590> moon<00:02:36.370> almost<00:02:36.849> has<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> reddish<00:02:37.540> color

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the the moon almost has a reddish color

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.159 
the the moon almost has a reddish color
to<00:02:38.079> it<00:02:38.200> why<00:02:38.379> is<00:02:38.439> that<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:40.480> right<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.049> you

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.169 
to it why is that that's right and you

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.300 
to it why is that that's right and you
know<00:02:41.200> that's<00:02:41.530> what's<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.950> most<00:02:42.040> spectacular

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
know that's what's the most spectacular

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.360 
know that's what's the most spectacular
part<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.329> lunar<00:02:43.480> eclipse<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.439> red<00:02:44.980> light

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
part of the lunar eclipse that red light

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.490 
part of the lunar eclipse that red light
that<00:02:45.579> you'll<00:02:45.730> see<00:02:45.969> what<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.359> call<00:02:46.599> totality<00:02:47.469> of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
that you'll see what we call totality of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.009 
that you'll see what we call totality of
the<00:02:47.709> lunar<00:02:47.980> eclipse<00:02:48.430> happens<00:02:48.879> about<00:02:49.389> 68

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
the lunar eclipse happens about 68

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.259 
the lunar eclipse happens about 68
minutes<00:02:50.290> after<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.889> starts<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.609> for<00:02:51.939> here<00:02:52.180> in

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
minutes after it starts so for here in

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.750 
minutes after it starts so for here in
north<00:02:52.449> america<00:02:52.599> in<00:02:53.199> india<00:02:53.889> in<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.370> eastern

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
north america in india in the eastern

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.539 
north america in india in the eastern
time<00:02:54.790> zone<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.659> begins<00:02:55.989> at<00:02:56.109> 133<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.189> eclipse

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
time zone it begins at 133 the eclipse

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.699 
time zone it begins at 133 the eclipse
and<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:57.969> it<00:02:58.060> goes<00:02:58.180> into<00:02:58.239> totality<00:02:59.139> 68

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
and then it goes into totality 68

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.580 
and then it goes into totality 68
minutes<00:02:59.949> later<00:03:00.280> at<00:03:00.459> 241<00:03:01.000> a.m.<00:03:01.780> eastern<00:03:02.409> time

minutes later at 241 a.m. eastern time

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.830 
minutes later at 241 a.m. eastern time
and<00:03:02.829> what<00:03:03.250> happens<00:03:03.699> is<00:03:03.879> that<00:03:03.909> it's<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.659> so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and what happens is that it's this is so

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.990 
and what happens is that it's this is so
romantic<00:03:05.049> Sheamus<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.889> think<00:03:05.919> it's<00:03:06.310> all<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
romantic Sheamus I think it's all the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.420 
romantic Sheamus I think it's all the
sunrises<00:03:07.719> and<00:03:07.750> sunsets<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.250> earth<00:03:09.400> that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
sunrises and sunsets of the earth that

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.390 
sunrises and sunsets of the earth that
RIM<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.209> earth<00:03:10.359> get<00:03:10.900> projected<00:03:11.409> onto<00:03:11.859> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
RIM the earth get projected onto the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.580 
RIM the earth get projected onto the
surface<00:03:12.939> of<00:03:12.969> the<00:03:13.389> Moon<00:03:13.659> so<00:03:14.260> what<00:03:14.439> you're

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
surface of the Moon so what you're

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.649 
surface of the Moon so what you're
seeing<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.129> Sun<00:03:15.370> light<00:03:15.579> refracting<00:03:16.510> or

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
seeing is the Sun light refracting or

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:17.879 
seeing is the Sun light refracting or
bending<00:03:17.169> through<00:03:17.409> Earth's<00:03:17.650> atmosphere

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
bending through Earth's atmosphere

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.999 
bending through Earth's atmosphere
around<00:03:18.549> its<00:03:19.060> rim<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.629> being<00:03:20.229> projected<00:03:20.500> right

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:21.009

on the moon on the surface and that the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.530 
on the moon on the surface and that the

more dust in the air of the earth the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.149 
more dust in the air of the earth the
redder<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.959> color<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.560> we<00:03:26.650> really<00:03:27.040> don't

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
redder the color and we really don't

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.649
