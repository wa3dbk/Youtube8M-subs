00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
found the two aces but we so we're going

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.209 
found the two aces but we so we're going
to<00:00:07.200> put<00:00:07.379> them<00:00:07.529> back<00:00:07.710> into<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.160> middle<00:00:08.340> again

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
to put them back into the middle again

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.060 
to put them back into the middle again
they're<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.639> into<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.940> center<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:13.070> we're

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
they're going into the center and we're

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.029 
they're going into the center and we're
going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> square<00:00:14.580> them<00:00:14.790> both<00:00:14.969> up<00:00:16.010> make<00:00:17.010> sure

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
going to square them both up make sure

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.310 
going to square them both up make sure
that's<00:00:17.250> squared<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.539> give<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> deck<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that's squared and then give the deck a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.290 
that's squared and then give the deck a
couple<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.859> cuts<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.580> help<00:00:20.730> mix<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.090> up<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
couple of cuts to help mix it up a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.470 
couple of cuts to help mix it up a
little<00:00:21.330> bit<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.320> then<00:00:22.740> find<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> Aces<00:00:23.730> right

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
little bit and then find the Aces right

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.000 
little bit and then find the Aces right
back<00:00:24.750> again<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:27.109> we<00:00:28.109> did<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> once<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.920> do

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
back again so we did it once we can do

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.290 
back again so we did it once we can do
it<00:00:29.099> twice<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.760> time<00:00:29.939> we're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
it twice but this time we're going to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.510 
it twice but this time we're going to
make<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.840> impossible<00:00:31.289> when<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.340> put

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
make it really impossible when we put

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.750 
make it really impossible when we put
the<00:00:32.610> Aces<00:00:32.969> into<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> middle<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.520> time

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the Aces into the middle so this time

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
the Aces into the middle so this time
we're<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> ask<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> spectator<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.890> see

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
we're going to ask the spectator to see

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.819 
we're going to ask the spectator to see
that<00:00:38.250> card<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.230> if<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.590> would

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that card right there and if they would

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.619 
that card right there and if they would
just<00:00:40.860> push<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.550> that's<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.510> going

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
just push that in that's actually going

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.910 
just push that in that's actually going
to<00:00:42.719> help<00:00:42.870> us<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.079> lot<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> trick<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.800> there

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
to help us a lot for the trick so there

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.830 
to help us a lot for the trick so there
you're<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> push<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> card<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
you're going to push the card in to the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.939 
you're going to push the card in to the
middle<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:48.149> goes<00:00:48.829> nice<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.860> squared<00:00:50.480> so

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
middle and it goes nice and squared so

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.130 
middle and it goes nice and squared so
we're<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.309> give<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.520> deck<00:00:53.789> shuffle

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.200 

square<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.350> again<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.820> give<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> an

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
square it up again and I give it an

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
square it up again and I give it an
overhand<00:01:00.660> shuffle<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:01.789> just<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.940> an

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
overhand shuffle as well just for an

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.490 
overhand shuffle as well just for an
extra<00:01:03.359> bit<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.539> mix<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.460> deck<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.850> squared

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
extra bit of mix so the deck is squared

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
extra bit of mix so the deck is squared
card<00:01:07.500> isn't<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.159> top<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.840> bottom<00:01:11.000> now

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
card isn't on the top or the bottom now

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.670 
card isn't on the top or the bottom now
we're<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.780> place<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> next<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
we're going to do is place the next a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.420 
we're going to do is place the next a
sin<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> middle<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.360> goes<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> we're

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
sin to the middle and it goes and we're

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.219 
sin to the middle and it goes and we're
going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.939> give<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.299> spectator<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> entire

going to give this spectator the entire
deck<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> themselves<00:01:20.040> they<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.909> square<00:01:21.299> place

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
deck to themselves they can square place

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.280 
deck to themselves they can square place
all<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.509> Aces<00:01:24.840> squared<00:01:25.140> with

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
all they want so the Aces squared with

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.030 
all they want so the Aces squared with
the<00:01:25.380> rest<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> pack<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:27.799> now<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.979> time

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the rest of the pack and now it's time

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
the rest of the pack and now it's time
for<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.430> shuffle<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:32.990> give<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> quick

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
for a shuffle so give that a quick

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.940 
for a shuffle so give that a quick
shuffle<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:39.200> can<00:01:40.200> give<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> some<00:01:40.650> cuts

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
shuffle here and can give it some cuts

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.249 
shuffle here and can give it some cuts
we<00:01:41.640> want<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.299> well<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.780> deck<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
we want it to as well so the deck is

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.780 
we want it to as well so the deck is
mixed<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:48.170> all<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.320> need<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.950> find<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
mixed and all we need to do is find the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.899 
mixed and all we need to do is find the
Aces<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:52.079> two<00:01:52.939> three<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.630> Aces<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.909> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
Aces one two three the Aces or back and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.610 
Aces one two three the Aces or back and
that's<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.110> trick

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.410 

okay<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.550> way<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:02.000> going<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.300> work

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
okay so the way this is going to work

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.440 
okay so the way this is going to work
you're<00:02:02.870> going<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.050> start<00:02:03.230> off<00:02:03.350> from<00:02:03.620> where<00:02:04.100> you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
you're going to start off from where you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.469 
you're going to start off from where you
possibly<00:02:05.450> left<00:02:05.720> off<00:02:05.930> from<00:02:06.140> last<00:02:06.380> week's<00:02:06.620> trick

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
possibly left off from last week's trick

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.790 
possibly left off from last week's trick
what<00:02:08.479> you're<00:02:08.630> going<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.869> do<00:02:08.990> is<00:02:09.260> take<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.710> to

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
what you're going to do is take it to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.760 
what you're going to do is take it to
aces<00:02:10.220> start<00:02:10.910> put<00:02:11.750> one<00:02:11.960> in<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> front<00:02:12.380> one<00:02:12.560> in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
aces start put one in the front one in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.440 
aces start put one in the front one in
the<00:02:13.040> back<00:02:13.070> you're<00:02:13.850> going<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.030> separate<00:02:14.360> them

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
the back you're going to separate them

slip out of the deck that time of one
extra<00:03:46.700> it's<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:46.970> little<00:03:47.150> easier<00:03:47.269> when<00:03:47.540> it's

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
extra it's a little easier when it's

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.590 
extra it's a little easier when it's
fast<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:49.220> that'll<00:03:49.760> get<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.060> Aces<00:03:50.330> off<00:03:50.480> the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
fast and that'll get the Aces off the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.440 
fast and that'll get the Aces off the
top<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.019> bottom<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:53.470> like<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.450> so

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
top and the bottom so like so so

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.910 
top and the bottom so like so so
practice<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:58.120> after<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.269> phase<00:03:59.920> what

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
practice that after that phase what

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.350 
practice that after that phase what
we're<00:04:01.070> going<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.250> do<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.519> two<00:04:01.670> cases<00:04:02.060> into<00:04:02.269> the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
we're going to do is two cases into the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.570 
we're going to do is two cases into the
middle<00:04:02.570> one<00:04:02.690> at<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.900> time<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:04.040> what<00:04:04.430> you're

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
middle one at a time so what you're

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
now what I usually what I like to do is

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.280 
now what I usually what I like to do is
a<00:05:59.910> riffle<00:06:00.910> just<00:06:01.210> keep<00:06:01.420> the<00:06:01.600> bottom<00:06:01.870> card<00:06:02.080> there

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290

a riffle just keep the bottom card there
make<00:06:02.500> sure<00:06:02.530> not<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.800> flash<00:06:03.070> and<00:06:03.370> then<00:06:04.030> a

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
make sure not to flash and then a

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.230 
make sure not to flash and then a
overhand<00:06:05.530> shuffle<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.250> just<00:06:06.820> shuffle<00:06:07.120> that

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
overhand shuffle and just shuffle that

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.810 
overhand shuffle and just shuffle that
card<00:06:07.480> so<00:06:07.600> it's<00:06:07.720> about<00:06:07.780> dead<00:06:08.140> center<00:06:08.760> square<00:06:09.760> up

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
card so it's about dead center square up

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.790 
card so it's about dead center square up
the<00:06:09.940> pack<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:11.020> thing<00:06:11.200> is<00:06:11.260> if<00:06:11.500> you<00:06:11.620> have

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
the pack and the thing is if you have

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.480 
the pack and the thing is if you have
the<00:06:12.100> card<00:06:12.430> face-up<00:06:13.950> it<00:06:14.950> will<00:06:15.220> create<00:06:15.400> a

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
the card face-up it will create a

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.100 
the card face-up it will create a
natural<00:06:15.730> break<00:06:16.120> with<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.420> rest<00:06:16.570> of<00:06:16.690> the<00:06:16.780> cards

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
natural break with the rest of the cards

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.260 
natural break with the rest of the cards
so<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:17.830> can<00:06:18.010> usually<00:06:18.160> cut<00:06:18.760> right<00:06:19.000> to<00:06:19.030> that

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
so you can usually cut right to that

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.220 
so you can usually cut right to that
card<00:06:19.590> right<00:06:20.590> there<00:06:20.800> so<00:06:21.900> what<00:06:22.900> we're<00:06:23.050> going<00:06:23.140> to

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
card right there so what we're going to

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.870 
card right there so what we're going to
do<00:06:23.380> this<00:06:23.560> time<00:06:23.800> though<00:06:24.010> is<00:06:24.190> just<00:06:24.580> take<00:06:24.760> your
