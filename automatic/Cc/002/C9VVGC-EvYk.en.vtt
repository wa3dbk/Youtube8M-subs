 The handle is an apprentice 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.040
 First of all, turn the steering wheel to Geider Sudo 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.089
 That is green 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.330
 While keeping the handle a 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.330
 I will advance the car forward 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.480
 If you get in the clothes 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.810
 Leader Suri Trader

 It was supposed to arrange 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 To stay in the middle of the green &amp; left the lure 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.070

 We played a funeral gift in the orange color of the ship 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:53.420
 Until now, I had canceled the guide when I turned this handle on the way, but this time 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.909
 Even if you correct this handle on the street 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.909
 The guide never stops 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.950

 I put it in the drive range now 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.000
 In that case, it approaches 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.470
 On this screen, when people come close when you go out 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.180

 It is also displayed on the top view screen When you turn the go handle 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.010
 In this way 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.140
 I wonder where the inner ring star passes 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.090
 I think sometimes I do not know where the tires are facing when parking 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.200
 But there is also here 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.310
