00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.780
 we can play others who start from scratch 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.309
 the bright criticism 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 so do not be 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.539
 the bridge on his knees 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.199
 Set up 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.460
 Antony Hegarty know Isa 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 Musician St 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.090
 the sooner that too 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 many more 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 but also like one 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 the light goes out 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 but in the past there was quite a lot 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.580
 is everything 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 Placed everything set 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 but the term 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 what remained 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 in Germany is the whole 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 once as a unit 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.060
 hence the term comes 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 Yapi ill 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.550
 more on top of that Â»says Linda that we just can not stand it that way 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.180
 for that together 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.330
 you have the most strength 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 kept in play 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.280
 Unger 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 they occupy 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.380
 minimum 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.079
 similar to other countries 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.159
 because they were in the name 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.689
 as in other countries where their countries 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.439
 June into it 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.409
