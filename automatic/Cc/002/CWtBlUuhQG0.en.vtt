by the positive i want to focus on a few
interactions<00:00:35.910> first<00:00:36.450> thing<00:00:36.570> we're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.809> to

interactions first thing we're going to
focus<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.800> fullback<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
focus on here is this fullback and I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.940 
focus on here is this fullback and I
don't<00:00:39.629> know<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:39.930> many<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> realize<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
don't know if many of you realize this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.229 
don't know if many of you realize this
if<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.190> ever<00:00:41.340> watched<00:00:41.670> her<00:00:41.850> played<00:00:42.030> football

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
if you ever watched her played football
it's<00:00:42.510> difficult<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.320> full<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> be

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it's difficult for the full back to be

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.430 
it's difficult for the full back to be
wrong<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.670> real<00:00:44.850> life<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.239> long<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:46.260> go

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
wrong in real life as long as he can go

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.500 
wrong in real life as long as he can go
out<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.649> block<00:00:46.980> someone<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> what

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.350 
understands that the ball is being ran
to<00:01:05.760> his<00:01:05.939> side<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:07.200> gonna<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.340> Mike<00:01:08.880> Pollak

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to his side I'm gonna go to Mike Pollak

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
to his side I'm gonna go to Mike Pollak
who<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> reserve<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.710> signed<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.430> he's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
who was a reserve that I signed and he's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
who was a reserve that I signed and he's
getting<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.600> pushback<00:01:12.990> from<00:01:13.500> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
getting a lot of pushback from this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440 
getting a lot of pushback from this
defensive<00:01:14.369> tackle<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.880> chip<00:01:15.240> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
defensive tackle I'm gonna chip this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.170 
defensive tackle I'm gonna chip this
tackle<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> biggest<00:01:17.729> lack

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
tackle because this is the biggest lack

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.990 
tackle because this is the biggest lack
of<00:01:18.540> containment<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.670> that's<00:01:20.670> fine

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
of containment that we have that's fine

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
of containment that we have that's fine
I<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:21.930> realistic<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
I like that that's realistic but the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.620 
I like that that's realistic but the
problem<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.580> when<00:01:23.759> he<00:01:23.850> gets<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.420> he

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
problem is when he gets out there he

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
problem is when he gets out there he
doesn't<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.170> he<00:01:25.860> decides<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.400> cut<00:01:26.610> back

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
doesn't do that he decides to cut back

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
doesn't do that he decides to cut back
and<00:01:27.380> essentially<00:01:28.380> block<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> linebacker<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and essentially block the linebacker you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.980 
and essentially block the linebacker you
see<00:01:29.759> off<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> far<00:01:30.390> distance<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.840> your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
see off in the far distance of your

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.109 
see off in the far distance of your
screen<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> positive<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
screen now there is a positive to this I

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.719 
screen now there is a positive to this I
like<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> fact<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.530> linebacker<00:01:35.070> kind

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
like the fact that this linebacker kind

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.190 
like the fact that this linebacker kind
of<00:01:35.820> came<00:01:36.000> through<00:01:36.770> ran<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> straight<00:01:38.280> line

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
of came through ran in a straight line

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.359 
of came through ran in a straight line
realizes<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.290> an<00:01:40.380> outside<00:01:40.740> run<00:01:40.979> has<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
realizes as an outside run has to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.039 
realizes as an outside run has to
shuffle<00:01:41.610> his<00:01:41.790> feet<00:01:42.119> set<00:01:42.509> himself<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
shuffle his feet set himself and
