00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.400
 Wages get traded in the temple here 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.849
 It's about one of the new battlefields 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 which material was added 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.160
 this counts the countdown already 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.460
 down we are in ten man team and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.939
 The battle starts now straight to the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.760
 the goal is the pages in the whole wg is it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.550
 to pick the marked balls so here 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.500
 you see, for example, in violet or 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.290
 also the green and if you also 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 moved to it could click and as soon as he 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.410
 clicked there are points 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.610
 for your team and there is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.809
 different consumption speak 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.579
 different numbers of points too 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.140
 different surfaces and if you 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.809
 of course with the ball in the middle 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.879
 Moved he also gets the most points 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.010
 but also offers an easy target for 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.750
 your opponents because the opponents have only 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 one in the sense of course they want that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.809
 player who keeps the ball kill and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.299
 then the ball gets back to its old one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.979
 position reset and the new player 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.290
 can grab this ball 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.240
 So again briefly summarized 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
 as well as well as teams 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.369
 stay together and allow people 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.049
 which of course have the balls and am 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.030
 It is easiest when you start 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.060
 have the session and then directly into the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.420
 In the middle he goes here most points 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.189
 received in a relatively short time and one 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.229
 couple of your theme always use them 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.299
 small part team and festive decorations or 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.750
 something that makes a lot of the match 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.850
 40 days of damage seeks the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.439
 opposing team after the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 ball carrier and tries this too 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.390
 finishen is a very good all in all 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 nice gameplay, however, requires 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.970
 some exercise in here , not in the example 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.579
 are in the group or anything 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.299
 do or you just crg somewhere that 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.299
 loses money
