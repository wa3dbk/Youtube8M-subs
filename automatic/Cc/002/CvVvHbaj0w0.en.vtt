satellite<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> satellite<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.240> used<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
satellite is a satellite that's used and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.609 
satellite is a satellite that's used and
that's<00:00:21.960> 28<00:00:22.439> degrees<00:00:23.039> east<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.760> due<00:00:24.330> south<00:00:24.630> now

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
that's 28 degrees east of due south now

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.290 
that's 28 degrees east of due south now
on<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.160> satellite<00:00:26.699> are<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> number<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
on that satellite are a number of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.900 
on that satellite are a number of
transponders<00:00:28.170> they're<00:00:28.619> also<00:00:28.769> known<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.369> TPS

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
transponders they're also known as TPS

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.450 
transponders they're also known as TPS
so<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> word<00:00:30.449> transponder<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> word<00:00:32.009> TP

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so the word transponder and the word TP

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.250 
so the word transponder and the word TP
are<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> same<00:00:32.910> thing<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.200> a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
pendrive to make it easier I'm going to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.979 
pendrive to make it easier I'm going to
use<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.819> one<00:02:33.000> with<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> flap<00:02:33.450> at<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.660> front
