00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.760
 two 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760
 Y 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.920
 Thank you 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 then 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.570
 like from my skin like a lizard brow 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.760
 I'm fed up with the rules imposed on me by four 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.160
 cats unwittingly after another that also 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.070
 my mouth becomes esparto and no longer 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.930
 share expert theories me 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.239
 I sleep between songs without wanting to 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.000
 a float for the cosmos dreaming of touching the 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.040
 moon crying for your absence when you 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.650
 you're not dying to bite those lips 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.050
 flavor of Lima tied to this rhythm with two 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.110
 flanges we fly nonstop 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.000
 shuffling alternatives condemned by the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.070
 hungry just like the name and opening the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.590
 refrigerator so that the light that alum 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.510
 the doorbell rang again, we exhausted 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.350
 the sand grains of the clock because the 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.700
 time does not sleep we usually stand firm 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 burning our fingerprints on fire 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 any surface 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.590
 let me apply you when the day is 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.490
 cloudy when everything that comes more 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.490
 we will go back to the past 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.219
 let's step on the bow let me take you 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.630
 where nobody has taken you leave that 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.299
 also when the day is cloudy 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.259
 when everything that we puncture will return to 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.179
 past we will see to step on the puddle leaves 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.369
 which takes you to our dream factory 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.709
 I want to feel the wind and take off 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.439
 feet on the floor only you and me that 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.219
 fuck the world just you and me leaving 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.530
 a good memory 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.229
 saving these moments on my disk 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.780
 hard life is a beat coordination and 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.179
 rhythm if everything I write has its 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.970
 meaning you have to live is something more than 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.489
 go unnoticed flies with me and 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.679
 let's get carried away by the wind 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.840
 towards a special corner every part of 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.579
 your body is a musical note a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 universal language of which to me 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.590
 I love talking, I spend the day at 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.239
 clouds counting the stars that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.849
 turn off every Monday 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.799
 talk about hip hop homie do not hesitate the 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.340
 limit is the sky for these three 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.340
 mens 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.049
 let me look at you when the day is 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.950
 cloudy when everything that comes more 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.950
 we will go back to the past 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.620
 to step on the one that takes you where nobody 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.720
 has taken let me warn you when the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.470
 day is cloudy when everything shines 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.090
 more we will go back to the past and we will see 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.760
 step on the puddle looking at the sky 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.459
 waiting for a missile calculating what 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.920
 I need to become a fossil by looking 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.810
 to heaven and I did not see it coming alone I go back to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.690
 get up because it has never been easy 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.030
 but the future very far from here and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.370
 work from sunrise to sunset because nothing comes out 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.940
 free everything is a dream that must be 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.370
 fulfill everything comes down to being happy 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.410
 living the day without a future 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.840
 it's hard to decide the exact way to not 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.030
 to be another martyr to love is to share as 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.739
 we usually say more the one that has it 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 saves and does not share it with anyone 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.330
 thinking the haro as brother and golem 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.140
 charlene from the heart to the mapfre so that 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.240
 the streets speak are feelings 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.830
 auditory 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.830
 and they are scattered through the air
