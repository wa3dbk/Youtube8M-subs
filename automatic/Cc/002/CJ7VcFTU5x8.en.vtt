packages to get it or you can just
choose<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> over<00:01:15.060> clasp<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.049> these<00:01:16.380> mods

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
choose the over clasp on the these mods

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
choose the over clasp on the these mods
that<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.580> sentry<00:01:17.939> guns<00:01:18.090> already<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.479> them

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that have sentry guns already on them

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.450 
that have sentry guns already on them
and<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.259> keep<00:01:19.409> planting<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> diffusing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and you just keep planting and diffusing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
and you just keep planting and diffusing
it<00:01:20.580> takes<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> millisecond<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.600> plant

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it takes like a millisecond to plant

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.560 
it takes like a millisecond to plant
some<00:01:22.170> reason<00:01:22.470> these<00:01:22.650> mods<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> just

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
some reason these mods and you can just

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
some reason these mods and you can just
keep<00:01:25.110> stacking<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> keep<00:01:26.189> checking<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
keep stacking up and keep checking and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.249 
keep stacking up and keep checking and
so<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.119> done<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
so that's what we done as you see how I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
so that's what we done as you see how I
test<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.700> quite<00:01:29.939> high

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
test it out see if I can get quite high

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
test it out see if I can get quite high
and<00:01:30.720> I'm<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.990> yeah<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and I'm like yeah we're good so I have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
and I'm like yeah we're good so I have
to<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.310> switch<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> just

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
to make my like switch here and it just

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.480 
to make my like switch here and it just
makes<00:01:33.509> me<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> air<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> want

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
makes me go up in the air then you want

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.890 
makes me go up in the air then you want
to<00:01:35.549> line<00:01:35.700> yourself<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> top<00:01:36.570> left<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
to line yourself up in the top left of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.260 
to line yourself up in the top left of
the<00:01:36.960> mini-map<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.130> you're<00:01:38.340> above<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.850> like

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the mini-map so you're above this like

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
the mini-map so you're above this like
corridor<00:01:40.140> thing<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
corridor thing and as you see it is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
corridor thing and as you see it is
pretty<00:01:42.090> much<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> same<00:01:42.659> height<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> upper

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
pretty much the same height as the upper

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
pretty much the same height as the upper
barrier<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.369> two<00:01:44.399> new<00:01:44.850> highest

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
barrier so these are two new highest

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.410 
barrier so these are two new highest
