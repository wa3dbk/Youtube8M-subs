close<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> same<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:28.060> that's<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.540> that's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
close to the same so that's the that's

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.930 
close to the same so that's the that's
all<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.709> very<00:02:30.010> very<00:02:30.160> easy<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
all you do to it it's very very easy and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.140 
all you do to it it's very very easy and
once<00:02:31.629> you<00:02:31.840> get<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.830> paper<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.459> here<00:02:33.700> too

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
once you get this paper on here too

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.479 
once you get this paper on here too
because<00:02:34.299> I<00:02:34.390> also<00:02:34.569> use<00:02:34.930> cardstock<00:02:35.379> for<00:02:36.340> these

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
because I also use cardstock for these

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.080 
because I also use cardstock for these
panels<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.810> makes<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.440> real<00:02:38.709> stiff<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.489> so

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
panels it makes it real stiff and so

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660 
panels it makes it real stiff and so
it's<00:02:40.269> very<00:02:40.510> easy<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:41.170> know<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.349> stand<00:02:42.069> up<00:02:42.400> I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670

my<00:03:04.000> extra<00:03:04.360> cut<00:03:04.540> file<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.780> didn't<00:03:05.170> cut<00:03:05.319> anything

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
my extra cut file I didn't cut anything

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.180 
my extra cut file I didn't cut anything
new<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.510> project<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.500> pulled<00:03:09.069> out

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
new for this project I just pulled out

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.850 
new for this project I just pulled out
cuts<00:03:09.519> I<00:03:09.700> already<00:03:10.060> had<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.680> normally<00:03:11.680> what<00:03:11.829> I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
cuts I already had and normally what I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.740 
cuts I already had and normally what I
do<00:03:11.980> when<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.340> cut<00:03:12.579> something<00:03:13.030> I'll<00:03:13.180> cut<00:03:13.510> more

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
do when I cut something I'll cut more

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.870 
do when I cut something I'll cut more
than<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.829> can<00:03:14.980> have<00:03:15.160> an<00:03:15.280> extra<00:03:15.609> one

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
than one just so I can have an extra one

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.270 
than one just so I can have an extra one
or<00:03:16.120> maybe<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.109> don't<00:03:17.200> know<00:03:17.440> what<00:03:17.620> size<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:18.040> want

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
or maybe I don't know what size I want

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.610 
or maybe I don't know what size I want
so<00:03:18.609> I'll<00:03:19.030> cut<00:03:19.329> two<00:03:19.600> different<00:03:19.900> sizes<00:03:20.350> but<00:03:20.560> I

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
so I'll cut two different sizes but I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.430 
so I'll cut two different sizes but I
usually<00:03:20.980> cut<00:03:21.579> two<00:03:21.940> whenever<00:03:22.720> I'm<00:03:22.870> cutting<00:03:23.260> I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
usually cut two whenever I'm cutting I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.559 
usually cut two whenever I'm cutting I
figured<00:03:24.069> I've<00:03:24.160> got<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.430> paper<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.940> there<00:03:25.120> I've

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
figured I've got the paper in there I've

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.349 
figured I've got the paper in there I've
got<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.019> car<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.470> there<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.980> might<00:03:27.250> as<00:03:27.400> well<00:03:27.609> cut

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
got the car in there I might as well cut

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.270 
got the car in there I might as well cut
an<00:03:28.480> extra<00:03:28.930> one<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.530> when<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.739> want<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:29.950> be<00:03:30.040> quiet

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280
