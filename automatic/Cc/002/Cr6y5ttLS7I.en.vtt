00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.020
 Tailor does not have a new one 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.470
 bike at the start 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.779
 the california the split panhead 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 is a coproduction with chris 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.910
 Richardson from the Los Angeles Speed ​​Shop 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.190
 the two have a total of six months 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.010
 used until the panhead was ready 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.350
 Danny is extra for it three times 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.630
 flown california 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:56.129
 she must be in august 25 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:01:04.309
 because that is an impudence 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:07.170
 the cooperation should now be completely established 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.509
 You can buy this bike but it has 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.550
 his price 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:24.600
 12000 francs cost the one-time 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:26.369
 creation is special on this bike 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 that there is a cooperation between 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.210
 besides, two friends was the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.940
 difficulty two completely different 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.790
 implement ideas so that it works 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.830
 the end product shows like both concepts 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 are merged into one another and very much 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.710
 harmonize well 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:49.530
 I think that's it 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:51.659
 especially on our bike we'll see what 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.520
 the future brings but the two are 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.520
 good for any surprise
