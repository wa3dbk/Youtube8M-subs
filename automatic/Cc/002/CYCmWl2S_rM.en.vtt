they're taking care of or how their
nutrition<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.529> it's<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.830> something<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
nutrition is it's just something that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.030 
nutrition is it's just something that

get<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.420> how<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.989> prevent<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
get and this is how you can prevent it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
get and this is how you can prevent it
now<00:00:38.280> what<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.700> some<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> causes<00:00:39.239> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
now what are some of the causes of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
now what are some of the causes of
tear-stained<00:00:40.260> yeah<00:00:40.710> there's<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.579> them

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
tear-stained yeah there's a lot of them

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240 
tear-stained yeah there's a lot of them
so<00:00:42.079> like<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.200> said<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.559> doesn't<00:00:43.860> mean<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so like I said it doesn't mean that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.709 
so like I said it doesn't mean that
they're<00:00:44.430> an<00:00:44.550> unhealthy<00:00:44.940> dog<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.600> they're

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
they're an unhealthy dog or that they're

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.279 
they're an unhealthy dog or that they're
not<00:00:45.750> taking<00:00:46.200> care<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:47.480> excessive<00:00:48.480> tearing<00:00:48.750> in

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289

foods<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
foods can do it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
foods can do it
mineral<00:00:58.289> content<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> water<00:00:59.280> infection

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
mineral content of the water infection

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
mineral content of the water infection
can<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> lots<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.680> things<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.160> cause<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
can do it lots of things can cause that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
can do it lots of things can cause that
that<00:01:03.120> red<00:01:03.300> coloration<00:01:04.129> if<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.700> an

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that red coloration if if it's an

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.570 
that red coloration if if it's an
infection<00:01:06.020> see<00:01:07.020> he<00:01:07.409> has<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.830> much<00:01:07.979> extra<00:01:08.250> skin

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
infection see he has so much extra skin

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
infection see he has so much extra skin
I<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.000> he<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.210> zoom<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.869> him

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I don't know if he can zoom in on him

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.800 
I don't know if he can zoom in on him
but<00:01:10.860> yeast<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.520> bacteria<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> grow<00:01:12.600> in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
but yeast and bacteria like to grow in

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.460 
but yeast and bacteria like to grow in
here<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> obviously<00:01:14.640> waters<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.229> then

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
here so the I obviously waters and then

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.719 
here so the I obviously waters and then
that's<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.770> perfect<00:01:17.100> breeding<00:01:17.250> ground<00:01:17.460> for

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that's a perfect breeding ground for

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.149 
that's a perfect breeding ground for
yeast<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.270> bacteria<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.380> yeast<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.740> grow<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
yeast in bacteria the yeast that grow is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
yeast in bacteria the yeast that grow is
called<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> red<00:01:20.700> yeast<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> causes<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
called the red yeast so it causes that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.109 
called the red yeast so it causes that
red<00:01:22.290> color<00:01:23.960> discoloration<00:01:24.960> okay<00:01:25.439> yeah

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
red color discoloration okay yeah

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.429 
red color discoloration okay yeah
excessive<00:01:27.119> tearing<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> too<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
excessive tearing can do it too and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
excessive tearing can do it too and
that's<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.159> extra<00:01:29.579> water<00:01:29.759> sitting<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.360> there

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that's just extra water sitting in there

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
that's just extra water sitting in there
dirt<00:01:31.079> accumulates<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.920> there

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
dirt accumulates in there

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.359 
dirt accumulates in there
causes<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.750> color<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.890> when<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> see

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
causes the the color and when you see

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
causes the the color and when you see
this<00:01:35.490> happening<00:01:36.119> indigo<00:01:36.479> here's<00:01:36.720> another

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
this happening indigo here's another

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.380 
this happening indigo here's another
example<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.890> dog<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> get

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
example now this dog you can see to get

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
example now this dog you can see to get
you<00:01:39.509> much<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> red<00:01:40.079> coloring<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.740> can

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you much in the red coloring and you can

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
you much in the red coloring and you can
just<00:01:40.979> eat<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.579> dog<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:42.030> here

just eat a lot in this dog right here
absolutely<00:01:42.829> sometimes<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.460> people<00:01:44.490> live<00:01:44.970> in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
absolutely sometimes if people live in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.639 
absolutely sometimes if people live in
an<00:01:45.180> area<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.570> waat<00:01:45.780> where<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> water<00:01:46.350> has<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
an area of waat where the water has a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
high mineral content here's a picture of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
high mineral content here's a picture of
the<00:01:48.869> dog<00:01:48.990> after<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> problem<00:01:50.250> has<00:01:50.369> been<00:01:50.520> taken

the dog after the problem has been taken
care<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.119> okay<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> doesn't<00:01:52.409> need<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.930> just

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
care of okay so it doesn't need to just

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.179 
care of okay so it doesn't need to just
because<00:01:55.170> your<00:01:55.290> dog<00:01:55.380> has<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.770> once<00:01:55.950> doesn't

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
mean that they can have it forever there

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.090 
mean that they can have it forever there
are<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.259> ways<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.590> treat<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> we'll

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
are some some ways to treat and we'll

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
are some some ways to treat and we'll
talk<00:01:59.280> about<00:01:59.430> those<00:01:59.729> too<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.689> could<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:01.020> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
talk about those too but it could be so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.600 
talk about those too but it could be so
many<00:02:01.350> things<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.070> almost<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> go

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
many things you you almost have to go

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.850 
many things you you almost have to go
through<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> process<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.270> elimination<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:04.680> see

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
through a process of elimination to see

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.709 
through a process of elimination to see
what<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> cause<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.420> treat

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
what the cause is so that you can treat

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.330 
what the cause is so that you can treat
it<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:07.680> about<00:02:07.770> treating<00:02:08.099> it

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
it how would you go about treating it

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.940 
it how would you go about treating it
are<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.550> certain<00:02:08.729> medications<00:02:09.450> or
