the painting i'm going to make today is
something<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.340> I've<00:00:31.849> been<00:00:32.119> doing<00:00:32.630> now<00:00:32.930> at

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
something that I've been doing now at

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.510 
something that I've been doing now at
making<00:00:33.440> little<00:00:33.590> studies<00:00:33.950> like<00:00:34.130> that<00:00:34.310> for

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
making little studies like that for

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.729 
making little studies like that for
about<00:00:34.610> 10<00:00:34.910> years<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:36.050> started<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.530> put

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
about 10 years and I started to put

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.950 
about 10 years and I started to put
these<00:00:36.829> bikini<00:00:37.250> girls<00:00:37.579> over<00:00:38.060> top<00:00:38.329> of<00:00:38.360> them<00:00:38.690> and

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
these bikini girls over top of them and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.139 
these bikini girls over top of them and
this<00:00:39.470> is<00:00:39.590> just<00:00:39.710> just<00:00:40.370> kind<00:00:40.579> of<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.700> fun<00:00:40.940> right

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
this is just just kind of a fun right

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.639 
this is just just kind of a fun right
now<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.360> bikini<00:00:41.840> girl<00:00:42.079> is<00:00:42.320> really<00:00:42.710> almost<00:00:43.670> the

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
now the bikini girl is really almost the

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.410 
now the bikini girl is really almost the
entire<00:00:45.649> foreground<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.460> guess<00:00:46.609> this<00:00:46.820> bar<00:00:47.149> over

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
entire foreground I guess this bar over

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.910 
entire foreground I guess this bar over
here<00:00:47.449> becomes<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.079> foreground<00:00:48.530> but<00:00:48.680> you<00:00:48.769> can

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
here becomes the foreground but you can

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.700 
here becomes the foreground but you can
see<00:00:49.070> how<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:49.219> changes<00:00:49.760> space<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.469> little

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
see how it changes space and a little

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.799 
see how it changes space and a little
bit<00:00:51.800> about<00:00:51.980> these<00:00:52.250> these<00:00:53.030> paintings<00:00:53.420> why<00:00:53.780> I

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
bit about these these paintings why I

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.689 
bit about these these paintings why I
make<00:00:54.170> them<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:54.620> think<00:00:54.710> they're<00:00:55.160> just<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.429> lot<00:00:55.579> of

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
make them I think they're just a lot of

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.790 
make them I think they're just a lot of
fun<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.149> like<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.420> play<00:00:56.539> with<00:00:56.750> color<00:00:56.989> and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
fun and I like to play with color and

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.709 
fun and I like to play with color and
they<00:00:58.039> remind<00:00:58.429> me<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.059> called<00:00:59.239> big<00:00:59.480> wave

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.420 

for<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.900> floor<00:04:05.140> color<00:04:05.379> I'm<00:04:05.709> going<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:06.099> mix<00:04:06.310> up

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
for the floor color I'm going to mix up

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.280

I'll<00:04:19.709> start<00:04:20.070> over<00:04:20.130> here<00:04:20.280> with<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.700> idea<00:04:21.269> that

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
I'll start over here with the idea that

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.780 
I'll start over here with the idea that
this<00:04:22.140> is<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.440> part<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.830> room<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
and then for this part of the room I'll

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.450 
and then for this part of the room I'll
add<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:36.080> little<00:04:36.350> white<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:36.980> color<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.400> I

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.220 
dry enough to go back into them but you
could<00:05:12.400> theoretically<00:05:13.030> just<00:05:13.480> put<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.690> grey<00:05:13.960> line

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
could theoretically just put a grey line

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.840 
could theoretically just put a grey line
right<00:05:14.620> down<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.980> middle<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.400> painting

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
right down the middle of the painting

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.300 
right down the middle of the painting
and<00:05:15.970> you<00:05:16.480> would<00:05:16.630> see<00:05:16.840> how<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:17.320> would<00:05:17.560> all<00:05:17.830> the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
and you would see how that would all the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.490 
and you would see how that would all the
sudden<00:05:18.550> change<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:19.540> space<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.140> painting

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
sudden change the space of the painting

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.570 
sudden change the space of the painting
the<00:05:20.620> gray<00:05:20.800> line<00:05:21.040> would<00:05:21.220> become<00:05:21.550> the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
the gray line would become the

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.420 
the gray line would become the
foreground<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:22.900> again<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.800> is<00:05:23.980> all<00:05:24.160> about

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
foreground so again this is all about

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.340 
foreground so again this is all about
having<00:05:24.640> fun<00:05:24.790> just<00:05:25.150> getting<00:05:25.450> used<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:25.840> painting

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
having fun just getting used to painting

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.770 
having fun just getting used to painting
and<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:27.520> more<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:27.820> paint<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.450> better<00:05:28.630> you

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
and the more you paint the better you

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.510 
and the more you paint the better you
