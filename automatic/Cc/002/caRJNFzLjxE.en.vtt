these you get a snoo effect as well and
then<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.879> mag<00:00:39.120> gel<00:00:39.570> holder<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.770> allows<00:00:41.040> you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
pull it across the flash head and then

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.840 
pull it across the flash head and then
you're<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.739> kind<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.010> even<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.459> up<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.730> your

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
flash head this was on an SB 850 900 and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.900 
flash head this was on an SB 850 900 and
SP<00:02:24.780> nine<00:02:24.989> tens<00:02:25.320> which<00:02:25.620> are<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.549> larger

side of flash heads and then to use it's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.800 
side of flash heads and then to use it's
super<00:02:31.290> easy<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.980> kind<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.280> look<00:02:35.489> at<00:02:35.610> the

super easy you just kind of look at the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.080 
super easy you just kind of look at the
magma<00:02:36.810> label<00:02:37.320> on<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.860> make<00:02:38.760> sure<00:02:38.790> that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
magma label on there and make sure that

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.970 
magma label on there and make sure that
it's<00:02:39.239> facing<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.810> cuz<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.560> doesn't<00:02:40.890> really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
it's facing you cuz it doesn't really

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.680 
it's facing you cuz it doesn't really
work<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.549> you're<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.209> know<00:02:42.239> trying<00:02:42.630> to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
know magnets near the camera magnets

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.810 
know magnets near the camera magnets
near<00:03:39.840> computer<00:03:40.530> magnets<00:03:41.040> near<00:03:42.500> compact<00:03:43.500> flash

near computer magnets near compact flash
drives<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.030> things<00:03:45.240> like<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:46.310> they

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
drives and things like that so they

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.880 
drives and things like that so they
haven't<00:03:47.550> seen<00:03:47.760> any<00:03:48.480> issues<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.110> think<00:03:49.740> they're

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
haven't seen any issues I think they're

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.370 
haven't seen any issues I think they're
trying<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.250> make<00:03:50.430> sure<00:03:50.460> that<00:03:50.820> people<00:03:51.380> are

trying to make sure that people are

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.710 
trying to make sure that people are
aware<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.700> magnet<00:03:54.030> should<00:03:54.210> not<00:03:54.450> cause

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
aware that the magnet should not cause

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.800 
aware that the magnet should not cause
issues<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:57.180> let's<00:03:57.750> put<00:03:57.960> that<00:03:57.990> one<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.440> bed

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
issues so let's put that one to bed

issues so let's put that one to bed
other<00:04:00.810> issues<00:04:01.200> are<00:04:01.410> things<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.860> if<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.130> try

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.740 
flash in and then put the maggrip in but
you<00:04:26.010> know<00:04:26.070> it<00:04:26.220> gets<00:04:26.310> fairly<00:04:26.760> complicated<00:04:27.240> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
you know it gets fairly complicated and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.590 
you know it gets fairly complicated and
you're<00:04:28.320> usually<00:04:28.830> using<00:04:29.040> these<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.880> know<00:04:30.330> with

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
you're usually using these you know with

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.450 
you're usually using these you know with
other<00:04:30.990> flash<00:04:31.320> modifiers<00:04:31.800> like<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.190> knocked<00:04:32.370> a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
other flash modifiers like it knocked a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.930 
other flash modifiers like it knocked a
box<00:04:32.670> or<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:33.560> softbox<00:04:34.560> anyway<00:04:35.040> when<00:04:35.670> you're<00:04:35.790> not

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
box or a softbox anyway when you're not

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.850 
box or a softbox anyway when you're not
really<00:04:36.180> looking<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.870> use<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.080> matte<00:04:37.380> grip<00:04:37.620> so

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
really looking to use the matte grip so

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.400 
really looking to use the matte grip so
it's<00:04:37.890> not<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.460> big<00:04:38.820> deal<00:04:39.290> a<00:04:40.490> bigger<00:04:41.490> deal<00:04:41.760> is

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
it's not that big deal a bigger deal is

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.390 
it's not that big deal a bigger deal is
with<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.700> 900<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:45.360> with<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:46.010> sb900<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.250> got

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
with the 900 so with the sb900 you got

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.800 
with the 900 so with the sb900 you got
some<00:04:47.730> buttons<00:04:48.420> down<00:04:48.720> here<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:50.420> I'm<00:04:51.420> not<00:04:51.630> even

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
some buttons down here that I'm not even

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.880 
some buttons down here that I'm not even
sure<00:04:51.960> what<00:04:52.140> they're<00:04:52.290> used<00:04:52.500> for<00:04:52.620> I<00:04:52.800> think

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
sure what they're used for I think

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.090 
sure what they're used for I think
they're<00:04:53.160> used<00:04:53.340> as<00:04:53.490> part<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.930> know<00:04:54.960> the

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
they're used as part of the you know the

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.380 
they're used as part of the you know the
diffusion<00:04:56.100> dome<00:04:56.730> that<00:04:56.760> goes<00:04:57.120> on<00:04:57.360> as<00:04:57.720> well<00:04:58.140> as

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
diffusion dome that goes on as well as

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.250 
diffusion dome that goes on as well as
they<00:05:00.390> like<00:05:00.660> on<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.290> gel<00:05:01.590> filter<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:03.270> when

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
they like on the gel filter so and when

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.540 
they like on the gel filter so and when
you<00:05:04.350> put<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.650> maggrip<00:05:04.860> on<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.430> actually

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
you put the maggrip on it actually

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.120 
you put the maggrip on it actually
depresses<00:05:06.420> that<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:07.110> your<00:05:07.830> flash

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
depresses that and your flash

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.129 
depresses that and your flash
automatically<00:05:09.000> goes<00:05:09.330> into<00:05:09.630> 17<00:05:10.560> millimeter

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
automatically goes into 17 millimeter

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.429 
automatically goes into 17 millimeter
I<00:05:11.229> believe<00:05:11.860> is<00:05:12.069> what<00:05:12.759> lochside<00:05:13.569> and<00:05:14.139> you<00:05:14.229> can't

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
I believe is what lochside and you can't

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.209 
I believe is what lochside and you can't
really<00:05:14.650> zoom<00:05:15.159> the<00:05:15.490> flash<00:05:15.759> at<00:05:16.300> all<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:17.919> get<00:05:18.039> that

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
really zoom the flash at all to get that

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.149 
really zoom the flash at all to get that
you<00:05:18.520> know<00:05:18.930> stronger<00:05:19.930> power<00:05:20.229> up<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.740> 200

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
you know stronger power up to 200

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:22.950 
you know stronger power up to 200
millimeter<00:05:21.550> or<00:05:22.029> what<00:05:22.419> have<00:05:22.629> you

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
millimeter or what have you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.429 
millimeter or what have you
with<00:05:23.889> the<00:05:24.069> flash<00:05:24.370> so<00:05:24.759> so<00:05:25.330> that<00:05:25.479> is<00:05:25.629> an<00:05:25.810> you<00:05:26.349> know

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:26.439 
with the flash so so that is an you know

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.279 
with the flash so so that is an you know
kind<00:05:26.650> of<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.770> major<00:05:26.949> drawback<00:05:27.370> with<00:05:27.939> the<00:05:28.289> 900

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
kind of a major drawback with the 900

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.110 
kind of a major drawback with the 900
and<00:05:29.469> I've<00:05:29.740> only<00:05:29.889> seen<00:05:30.219> that<00:05:30.400> with<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.610> 900

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
and I've only seen that with the 900

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.570 
and I've only seen that with the 900
actually<00:05:31.810> with<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.050> 910<00:05:32.650> it's<00:05:33.400> got<00:05:33.550> a

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
actually with the 910 it's got a

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.429 
actually with the 910 it's got a
slightly<00:05:33.909> different<00:05:34.180> design<00:05:34.479> here<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.169> so

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
slightly different design here and so

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.189 
slightly different design here and so
that<00:05:35.590> doesn't<00:05:35.830> occur<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:37.240> magma<00:05:37.569> does<00:05:37.900> work

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
that doesn't occur the magma does work

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.469 
that doesn't occur the magma does work
fine<00:05:38.800> at<00:05:39.039> least<00:05:39.159> I've<00:05:39.729> seen<00:05:39.969> it<00:05:40.090> work<00:05:40.180> fine

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
fine at least I've seen it work fine

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.730 
fine at least I've seen it work fine
with<00:05:40.779> my<00:05:40.930> 910

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
with my 910

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.279 
with my 910
it<00:05:42.069> just<00:05:42.460> just<00:05:43.240> has<00:05:43.389> problems<00:05:43.810> with<00:05:43.930> that<00:05:44.050> Jim

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
it just just has problems with that Jim

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.029 
it just just has problems with that Jim
had<00:05:44.319> with<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.430> 900<00:05:46.120> so<00:05:46.620> something<00:05:47.620> to<00:05:47.710> keep<00:05:47.830> in

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
had with the 900 so something to keep in

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.070 
had with the 900 so something to keep in
mind<00:05:48.250> depending<00:05:48.490> on<00:05:48.729> what<00:05:48.939> what<00:05:49.659> flashes<00:05:50.050> you

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
mind depending on what what flashes you

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.140 
mind depending on what what flashes you
have<00:05:50.319> the<00:05:50.919> other<00:05:51.099> thing<00:05:51.310> I<00:05:51.639> wanted<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.060> point

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
have the other thing I wanted to point

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.149 
have the other thing I wanted to point
out<00:05:52.419> is<00:05:52.719> that<00:05:52.750> these<00:05:53.169> magnets<00:05:53.710> if<00:05:53.919> you're<00:05:54.039> not

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
out is that these magnets if you're not

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.610 
out is that these magnets if you're not
careful<00:05:54.370> can<00:05:54.969> come<00:05:55.360> out<00:05:55.539> and<00:05:55.840> that's<00:05:56.080> what

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
careful can come out and that's what

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.369 
careful can come out and that's what
just<00:05:56.979> happened<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:58.750> me<00:05:58.930> here<00:06:00.240> so<00:06:01.240> this<00:06:01.719> was<00:06:01.990> I

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
just happened to me here so this was I

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:12.420 
just happened to me here so this was I
had<00:06:02.650> these<00:06:02.800> 2<00:06:03.039> mag<00:06:04.349> grids<00:06:05.349> together<00:06:08.460> and<00:06:11.430> and

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
had these 2 mag grids together and and

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.510 
had these 2 mag grids together and and
they<00:06:12.580> came<00:06:12.729> out<00:06:12.879> and<00:06:14.099> so<00:06:15.099> you<00:06:15.159> got<00:06:15.339> to<00:06:15.430> be

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
they came out and so you got to be

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.820 
they came out and so you got to be
careful<00:06:15.729> about<00:06:16.089> that<00:06:16.150> usually<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.409> they<00:06:17.680> are

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
careful about that usually and they are

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.469 
careful about that usually and they are
really<00:06:18.339> strong<00:06:18.810> when<00:06:19.810> put<00:06:20.139> together<00:06:20.400> usually

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
really strong when put together usually

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.959 
really strong when put together usually
you'll<00:06:22.500> you<00:06:23.500> know<00:06:23.620> instead<00:06:24.129> of<00:06:24.279> pulling<00:06:24.759> them

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
you'll you know instead of pulling them

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.709 
you'll you know instead of pulling them
straight<00:06:25.389> out<00:06:26.669> you'll<00:06:27.669> kind<00:06:27.909> of<00:06:28.000> twist<00:06:28.360> and

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
straight out you'll kind of twist and

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.079 
straight out you'll kind of twist and
pull<00:06:29.439> them<00:06:29.589> off<00:06:29.680> like<00:06:29.949> that<00:06:30.099> and<00:06:30.370> you<00:06:31.060> don't

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
pull them off like that and you don't

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:32.429 
pull them off like that and you don't
have<00:06:31.360> any<00:06:31.509> problem<00:06:31.839> with<00:06:31.960> the<00:06:32.080> 9<00:06:32.229> that's

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:32.439 
have any problem with the 9 that's

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.219 
have any problem with the 9 that's
coming<00:06:32.740> up<00:06:33.120> so<00:06:34.120> that's<00:06:34.270> that's<00:06:34.629> the<00:06:34.899> one<00:06:35.020> thing

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
coming up so that's that's the one thing

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.029 
coming up so that's that's the one thing
to<00:06:35.379> keep<00:06:35.409> in<00:06:35.680> mind<00:06:35.740> with<00:06:36.099> that<00:06:36.129> so<00:06:37.860> embedded<00:06:38.860> in

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
to keep in mind with that so embedded in
