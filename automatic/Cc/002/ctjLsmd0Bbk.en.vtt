gaining<00:01:37.409> acceptance<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.670> cases<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.210> to

gaining acceptance in some cases up to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
now it's been more or less a computer

guys<00:01:41.460> sort<00:01:41.969> of<00:01:42.090> service<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
guys sort of service but I think of it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410 
guys sort of service but I think of it
now<00:01:43.499> as<00:01:43.709> a<00:01:43.770> simple<00:01:44.549> appliance<00:01:44.969> that<00:01:45.030> doesn't

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
now as a simple appliance that doesn't

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.789 
now as a simple appliance that doesn't
seem<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.749> such<00:01:45.959> a<00:01:45.990> part<00:01:46.289> of<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> computer

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
seem like such a part of a computer

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.410 
seem like such a part of a computer
network<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.219> that<00:01:47.459> may<00:01:47.639> be<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> ticket

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
network and that may be just the ticket

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.020 
network and that may be just the ticket
to<00:01:48.689> introduce<00:01:49.380> voice<00:01:49.619> over<00:01:49.920> IP<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> whole

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to introduce voice over IP to a whole

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510

new generation of users you don't have

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
new generation of users you don't have
to<00:01:53.639> be<00:01:53.729> computer<00:01:54.179> savvy<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.109> benefits

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
to be computer savvy to see the benefits

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
to be computer savvy to see the benefits
of<00:01:55.649> voice<00:01:55.889> and<00:01:56.039> now<00:01:56.609> you<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of voice and now you don't have to be a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.809 
of voice and now you don't have to be a
computer<00:01:57.719> expert<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.499> install<00:01:58.859> it<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.100> use<00:01:59.789> it
