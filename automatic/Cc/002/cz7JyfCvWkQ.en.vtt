button<00:02:14.420> when<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.230> put<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.530> stand<00:02:15.799> on<00:02:16.040> it's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
button when you put the stand on it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.610 
button when you put the stand on it's
going<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.519> be<00:02:16.640> very<00:02:17.209> difficult<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:18.019> get<00:02:18.500> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
going to be very difficult to get the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.090 
going to be very difficult to get the
monitor<00:02:18.980> back<00:02:19.100> off<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.549> stand<00:02:20.769> okay<00:02:21.769> now

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
monitor back off of the stand okay now

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.250 
monitor back off of the stand okay now
what<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.400> need<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.670> do<00:02:22.819> is<00:02:23.150> flip<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.750> unit<00:02:23.870> back

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
what we need to do is flip the unit back

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.140 
what we need to do is flip the unit back
over<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:24.829> we<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.040> take<00:02:25.190> off<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.340> front<00:02:25.910> piece

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
over so we can take off that front piece

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.740 
over so we can take off that front piece
the<00:02:26.959> reason<00:02:27.170> we<00:02:27.290> had<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.769> way<00:02:27.980> is

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the reason we had to do it that way is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.599 
the reason we had to do it that way is
sometimes<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:30.349> control<00:02:30.829> panel<00:02:31.130> will<00:02:31.340> stick

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
sometimes this control panel will stick

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.030 
sometimes this control panel will stick
to<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.000> front<00:02:32.209> bezel<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.680> don't<00:02:33.859> want<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
to the front bezel and you don't want to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.920 
to the front bezel and you don't want to
break<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.340> wiring<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.389> we<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.540> remove

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
break the wiring on it so we just remove

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.180 
break the wiring on it so we just remove
the<00:02:36.049> front<00:02:36.260> bezel<00:02:36.410> now<00:02:38.049> okay<00:02:39.079> now<00:02:39.380> on<00:02:39.620> each<00:02:39.859> end

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
the front bezel now okay now on each end

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.390 
the front bezel now okay now on each end
of<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.489> unit<00:02:40.819> there<00:02:41.359> are<00:02:41.389> two<00:02:41.780> screws<00:02:42.400> there's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
of the unit there are two screws there's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400 
of the unit there are two screws there's
standard<00:02:43.730> Phillips<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.750> we'll<00:02:44.930> remove<00:02:45.079> those

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
standard Phillips so we'll remove those

00:02:45.410 --> 00:03:09.860 
standard Phillips so we'll remove those
on<00:02:45.650> each<00:02:45.769> end

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.259

we<00:05:01.800> can<00:05:01.979> flip<00:05:02.370> it<00:05:02.550> over<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:03.060> here<00:05:03.720> is<00:05:03.840> the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
we can flip it over and here is the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.860 
we can flip it over and here is the
control<00:05:04.710> panel<00:05:04.979> /<00:05:05.699> power<00:05:06.030> supply<00:05:06.419> board<00:05:06.720> that

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
control panel / power supply board that

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.900 
control panel / power supply board that
we<00:05:06.990> will<00:05:07.110> be<00:05:07.229> working<00:05:07.440> on<00:05:07.740> there's<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.639> couple

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
we will be working on there's a couple

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:35.649 
we will be working on there's a couple
of<00:05:09.120> screws<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.840> will<00:05:10.020> need<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.289> be<00:05:10.440> removed

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.980 

and<00:05:36.659> then<00:05:37.259> you<00:05:37.379> need<00:05:37.559> to<00:05:37.710> remove<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.990> control

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
and then you need to remove the control

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.200 
and then you need to remove the control
panel<00:05:40.439> cables<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.099> just<00:05:41.309> come<00:05:41.879> through<00:05:41.909> these

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
panel cables and just come through these

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.019 
panel cables and just come through these
little<00:05:42.379> tabs<00:05:43.379> and<00:05:43.800> then<00:05:44.550> you<00:05:44.699> should<00:05:44.879> be<00:05:44.969> able

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
little tabs and then you should be able

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.730 
little tabs and then you should be able
to<00:05:45.149> lift<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.509> power<00:05:45.629> supply<00:05:45.990> board<00:05:46.020> out<00:05:46.439> and

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
to lift the power supply board out and

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.679 
to lift the power supply board out and
this<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:47.849> board<00:05:48.059> we<00:05:48.210> will<00:05:48.330> be<00:05:48.479> working

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:48.689 
this is the board we will be working

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.950 
this is the board we will be working
line<00:05:49.069> we<00:05:50.069> will<00:05:50.189> be<00:05:50.339> replacing<00:05:50.759> the<00:05:51.330> capacitors

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
line we will be replacing the capacitors

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.320 
line we will be replacing the capacitors
the<00:05:52.080> large<00:05:52.289> power<00:05:53.159> capacitors<00:05:53.849> on<00:05:54.029> the<00:05:54.119> board

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
the large power capacitors on the board

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.920 
the large power capacitors on the board
and<00:05:54.919> bringing<00:05:55.919> it<00:05:56.009> back<00:05:56.129> to<00:05:56.189> life<00:05:56.479> so<00:05:57.479> now

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
and bringing it back to life so now

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.700 
and bringing it back to life so now
we're<00:05:58.020> going<00:05:58.139> to<00:05:58.199> take<00:05:58.319> it<00:05:58.409> over<00:05:58.499> to<00:05:58.619> the

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
we're going to take it over to the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.649 
we're going to take it over to the
soldering<00:05:59.039> station<00:05:59.550> replace<00:06:00.479> those

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
soldering station replace those

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.420 
soldering station replace those
capacitors<00:06:01.349> and<00:06:01.559> get<00:06:01.710> this<00:06:01.830> board<00:06:02.069> back<00:06:02.249> up

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
capacitors and get this board back up

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.699 
capacitors and get this board back up
and<00:06:02.550> running
