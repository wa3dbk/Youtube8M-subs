okay guys I'm gonna start up the

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.410 
okay guys I'm gonna start up the
computer<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:05.240> try<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:07.670> replicate<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.090> problem

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
computer I try to replicate the problem

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
okay what's that rage I was on raise III

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.320 
okay what's that rage I was on raise III
demon<00:01:33.430> when<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.610> happened<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.000> last<00:01:34.030> two

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
demon when it happened the last two

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.520 
demon when it happened the last two
times<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:37.540> wait<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:37.750> bit<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.200> shouldn't<00:01:38.470> be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
times now wait a bit you shouldn't be

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.400 
times now wait a bit you shouldn't be
long

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
long

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.650 
long
usually<00:01:41.410> it<00:01:42.220> starts<00:01:42.400> at<00:01:42.760> I<00:01:43.000> know<00:01:43.180> it's

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
usually it starts at I know it's

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.320 
usually it starts at I know it's
starting<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.110> happen<00:01:44.260> because<00:01:45.330> you're

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
starting to happen because you're

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.110 
starting to happen because you're
getting<00:01:46.420> doubling<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.800> colors<00:01:48.130> don't

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
getting doubling and the colors don't

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.760 
getting doubling and the colors don't
letters<00:01:49.420> most<00:01:49.630> are<00:01:49.780> doubling<00:01:50.260> on<00:01:50.440> each<00:01:50.560> other

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
letters most are doubling on each other

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.670 
letters most are doubling on each other
and<00:01:51.100> you're<00:01:51.190> gonna<00:01:51.610> have<00:01:51.760> weird<00:01:52.420> colors<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:53.140> lot

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
and you're gonna have weird colors a lot

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:03.360 
and you're gonna have weird colors a lot
of<00:01:53.800> explaining

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:16.870 

hmm

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.390 

that's<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.570> kiss<00:02:18.140> somebody<00:02:18.440> said<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.920> collect

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
that's a kiss somebody said to collect

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.490 
that's a kiss somebody said to collect
but<00:02:19.910> that's<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.420> left<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.020> desk<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.440> this

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
but that's to left it's a desk like this

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:34.520 
but that's to left it's a desk like this
alone

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.540 

okay

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.400 

I'm<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.270> hoping<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.750> does<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.260> this

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I'm really hoping it does do it this

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.850 
I'm really hoping it does do it this
time<00:02:40.680> because<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.660> maybe<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.050> solved<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
time because that way maybe I solved the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.190 
time because that way maybe I solved the
problem<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.370> removed<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.880> program<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.840> I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
problem I removed a program that I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.950 
problem I removed a program that I
thought<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.410> made<00:02:46.710> because<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.550> issue

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
thought that made because of the issue

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.250 
thought that made because of the issue
program<00:02:48.960> called<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.410> magic<00:02:49.680> tool<00:02:50.930> it's<00:02:51.930> used<00:02:52.110> by

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
program called a magic tool it's used by

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.540 
program called a magic tool it's used by
my<00:02:52.410> monitor<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:55.230> calibrate<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.010> colors<00:02:56.370> and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
my monitor to calibrate the colors and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.080 
my monitor to calibrate the colors and
stuff

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.220 

so<00:03:04.750> far<00:03:05.050> it's<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.739> doing<00:03:06.040> it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.020 

she's<00:03:11.230> starting<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.740> do<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.890> Nana<00:03:12.190> about<00:03:13.890> now

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
she's starting to do it Nana about now

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:41.720 
she's starting to do it Nana about now
see<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.640> says<00:03:18.850> here

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.000 

laughter<00:03:42.540> there<00:03:43.080> goes<00:03:43.819> there<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:45.030> goes<00:03:46.010> it's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
laughter there goes there it goes it's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.149 
laughter there goes there it goes it's
flashing<00:03:49.220> see<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.989> seems<00:03:52.260> like<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.530> GPU<00:03:52.950> is

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
flashing see it seems like the GPU is

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.020 
flashing see it seems like the GPU is
like<00:03:53.370> resetting<00:03:53.940> itself<00:03:54.060> continuously<00:03:56.030> like

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
like resetting itself continuously like

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:05.300 
like resetting itself continuously like
there's<00:03:57.239> something<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.629> doesn't<00:03:57.780> like<00:04:04.310> it's

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
there's something it doesn't like it's

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.050 
there's something it doesn't like it's
gonna<00:04:05.459> do<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.819> for<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> while

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.810 

and<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:11.959> gonna<00:04:15.340> it's<00:04:16.340> gonna<00:04:16.430> be<00:04:16.639> set

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and then it's gonna it's gonna be set

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.340 
and then it's gonna it's gonna be set
itself<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.269> last<00:04:17.420> time<00:04:17.660> it's<00:04:17.870> gonna<00:04:17.989> be<00:04:18.109> okay

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
itself the last time it's gonna be okay

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.810 
itself the last time it's gonna be okay
afterwards<00:04:20.769> until<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:22.040> we<00:04:24.340> restarted<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.580> next

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
afterwards until I we restarted the next

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.299 
afterwards until I we restarted the next
day

00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:32.309 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:37.819 

it's<00:04:32.819> kind<00:04:33.029> of<00:04:33.059> weird<00:04:33.179> mind<00:04:36.379> it<00:04:37.379> feels<00:04:37.649> like

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:37.829 
it's kind of weird mind it feels like

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:40.939 
it's kind of weird mind it feels like
the<00:04:37.919> computer<00:04:38.309> the<00:04:38.699> GPU<00:04:39.389> needs<00:04:39.629> to<00:04:39.839> heat<00:04:40.289> up<00:04:40.319> to

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
the computer the GPU needs to heat up to

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:48.219 
the computer the GPU needs to heat up to
a<00:04:40.979> certain<00:04:41.249> degree<00:04:43.339> before<00:04:44.339> it<00:04:44.459> for<00:04:45.209> its<00:04:45.329> okay

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.949
