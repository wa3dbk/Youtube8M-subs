00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
to where I started from and hopefully

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.450

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
get back there before the aeroplanes I

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.880 
get back there before the aeroplanes I
think<00:01:34.460> Mike's<00:01:34.940> expectations<00:01:35.690> are<00:01:36.080> for<00:01:36.500> me<00:01:36.650> to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
think Mike's expectations are for me to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.219 
think Mike's expectations are for me to
just<00:01:37.550> turn<00:01:37.759> as<00:01:38.030> tightly<00:01:38.360> as<00:01:38.600> i<00:01:38.750> possibly<00:01:39.140> can

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
just turn as tightly as i possibly can

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.310 
just turn as tightly as i possibly can
to<00:01:39.619> get<00:01:39.710> back<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.160> runway<00:01:40.600> I'm<00:01:41.600> not<00:01:42.259> a
