 Hey, people, remembering the flag, I'm 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.270
 Here to make some news for you. 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.070
 about dragon ball z 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:37.149
 after 18 years without production 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.989
 in the case of anime even without being a movie 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:44.620
 is back 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:49.310
 dragonball the name translated to English 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.460
 I went through the news sites given as the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:57.760
 super dragon ball now tradition can 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.760
 be also hyper hyper mega power 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.079
 thing but translated as super and as 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.420
 super is usually the main word 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.000
 in these situations is well 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.860
 likely to be the same 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.630
 will be used in English 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.050
 now three main things involving 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.790
 this news I'm going to say here and 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.430
 then you, if you want 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.860
 You understand English because neither the news 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.020
 I picked up an English website and it's okay. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.510
 detailed information has enough information there goes 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.340

 link in the description thing will happen 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.010
 after the saga of the sea ​​of good 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.200
 now we do not know if they go from 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.690
 see gt what's so much for there 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.490
 A lot for me I believe I will or I will not 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.180
 trying to fit things I do not believe 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.229
 which as they are already ignoring in the movies 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.369
 huh 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.640
 I believe they will ignore so gt 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.680
 According to important information, 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.869
 July will be displayed weekly 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.880
 if we have a Sunday I do not remember 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.739
 week exactly but I do not know what's going on 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.519
 be displayed weekly from 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.040
 July 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:17.959
 I do not know how long this will last 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.359
 has subscribed to the site but nothing else 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.010
 I know if it was to see you're revealed. 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.920
 how long ago 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.230
 this is not going to be the 25th season 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.110
 episodes of 12 episodes or if it goes 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.200
 I can not wait 50 100 episodes I do not know 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.260
 I know neither the third goal but the important 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.900
 is written by akira toriyama the author of 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.190
 that is to say, we can consider 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.829
 being the champion what will be released 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.720
 now who wants to read more news more 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.359
 details anyway more comments have 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.170
 comments from other participants 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:57.890
 neither end of the production has where there thing 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 also on the registration link now about 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.250
 what is going to be 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.639
 I believe that everything indicates that it will be 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:09.379
 really about this matter of the gods 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:12.200
 12 and if the new universe that was created 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.299
 between the ball is going to be explored and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.700
 few movies really is all success 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.239
 do not pick it up we'll even produce with the 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.500
 series and then continue weekly there 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.079
 Why not 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.599
 will probably they will try and punch 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.160
 gather the events that will happen in the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.709
 anime we will try to correlate as the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.359
 of the films to rotate for example a 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.489
 sequence of episodes the game and then 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.650
 They're going to release a movie, but I do not know if 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.669
 once a year will leave a film movie 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.430
 new and I do not know how they will do it anymore 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:46.750
 I think it's going to have a relationship with 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.750
 these gods are not 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:04:11.419
 a dragon ball video stresses that the name 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:04:13.400
 would be 22 in fact is that the two more 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.909
 anyway just a correction here that I am 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.310
 making 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.229
 When I read the news I did not love nor 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.030
 where I just found it interesting 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.310
 because it had because it really was very 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.690
 fan of dragon ball and neither was 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.570
 when I was a child watching that it was 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.970
 beautiful way but has a time with 12 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.370
 13 years I started playing the games 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.560
 from play 2000 brother at that time he 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.820
 I was hooked, I got there. 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.889
 playstation 2 games 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.050
 dragonball are very well but today I 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.560
 I watch by watching to know what 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.530
 will, give 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.730
 what will be shown nerd new or not 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.440
 So I found it cool because 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.490
 simply to a new stage does not 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.389
 I was like this 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.560
 but that move from mine to mine 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.520
 passion 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:06.080
 more than accompanies you more 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.000
 because even if google is what it is 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:15.560
 so dragonball is always good to us 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.389
 to know what is going on because it is 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.889
 what's that 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.660
 I want to know what you think 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:26.510
 Did you find the news that you 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:28.810
 waiting for this new series to like it 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.810
 that 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.000
 facebook is that in the channel group 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.289
 facebook are both on the rise 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.789
 definition 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.350
 I always saw the war in this final part 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.450
 It's too weak to speak 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.450
 fast and not here until the next
