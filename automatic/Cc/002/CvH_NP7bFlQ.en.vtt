00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.289
 other interview maybe you have 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.140
 seen the previous one 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.720
 we give them a little more focus on 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.940
 him on his game in the team and 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.860
 so 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.060
 since when are you at millenium and 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.770
 how were you contacted then 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.450
 officially it's been a month and 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.700
 a few i went back to millenium 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.500
 I started before I played with the team 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.940
 code directly finally with carnage that 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.190
 is my guy who is the captain of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.980
 this team there are within two-three months 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.800
 kind in november I came back this 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 in the team because at the level of my 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.940
 individual performance eac 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.350
 confirmed that I was really a plus 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.879
 for the team I bring like like 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.800
 every day actually we have a specific 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.629
 specificities and we each bring a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.980
 thing and suddenly and it's thanks to my 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.360
 individual level a little that did that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.830
 I went to union what is your 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.809
 role in a Swiss team leye ley in 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.150
 do I am to the person who is going to have 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.590
 do the most of kiel ie you 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.200
 will always have to see me upstairs in the 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.340
 chart and that's my role what can I 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.229
 not make bad guy hiccup a 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.520
 found out how exactly it's going 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.220
 because there are two english people in the team 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.200
 of which Marc Ideas and another who will be 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.620
 surely it's jake yeah that's jake going 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.570
 surely is an essay 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.770
 and how does it go with that is it 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.240
 that you manage a little English is what 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.850
 you manage to communicate well in tournaments 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.200
 all this bah blow down in game finally 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.970
 in the when one is in full party 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.430
 high it's pretty easy because what's going 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 to be a little more difficult is to have 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.820
 good reports finally have a good laugh with 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.840
 and his agencies and massa has sometimes that I 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.800
 want with English from low blow to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 it's a bit difficult 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.700
 and as and when my english he 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.540
 gets better and suddenly that's okay 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.040
 pass through the shot 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.290
 I imagine that everyone leaves rather 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.300
 less obliged do you 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.050
 savelli 53 it was in england it's 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.600
 that king had finished 3rd 3rd you can us in 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.320
 to talk a little bit about this file we have 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 finished third 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.370
 a result that is personally that 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.930
 I find it a bit bad in the sense that 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.720
 we could have really won this lan 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.369
 quite easily for example the top-12 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.540
 this event we had beaten already but 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.979
 they beat us rank when the 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.570
 children when they joined us they 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.130
 beat us so we did like 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.170
 so long and if the person 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.420
 so I think we could have 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.770
 really win this event by setting 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.690
 some communication problems 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.710
 of individual errors if it's 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.810
 really what cost us the victory 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.120
 for me but as and when 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.740
 time has really improved since 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.360
 this event was okay or who is 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.360
 it is agreed that the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.920
 take a break his wife also reassembled 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.519
 where are we 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.019
 ok so the blow aside this 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.629
 insomnia yesterday you planned lan 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.549

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.159
 on the biggest event where you are very 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.109
 very well and bombed aside this 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.170
 Small equipped focus is on what you 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.099
 can 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.209
 could you just 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.060
 maybe tell your best memory 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.880
 donkey a little thing that you personal 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.950
 yeah that I lived myself I would have had 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.959
 my first real tournament performance 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.709
 european it was the thought was of 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.810
 10 in amsterdam 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.310
 we made a top 3 on their own and 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.130
 not expected at the time I had it 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.870
 oxygen heart he's already gone to 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.270
 millenium also in young carbon 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.110
 players little brother of gouaix tagaq the 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.000
 share of the players call of duty 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.120
 know a young day also he 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.620
 was 15 years old on the shoulder and so says luxury 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.140
 that there is also a child on his 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.569
 hull and otherwise I would have said also the 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.130
 second but bolt the sw france the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.729
 first time it was after year that it 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.829
 that it was happening so you really 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.130
 a climb up to advance warfare 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.250
 we really saw a boost on your side 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.580
 what is it at +13 is this 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.949
 I really like you 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.120
 is new opus at the end that motivates 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.770
 and has more time to play what is 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.270
 which makes you better in fact 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.620
 last year on call of duty ghost 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.060
 as his name indicated ghost I 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.379
 really made a ghost season what 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.909
 I really did not touch the game at all 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.530
 I'm leaving in my game 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.060
 how to say I really do not have any 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.650
 tact with I did not take pleasure in it 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.789
 play everything when I had to 2.27 needs 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.949
 redo I said to myself I prefer the 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.479
 same thing the low shots I played all 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.939
 the days even though I'm going to class I 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.319
 always go to high school myself even though I 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.750
 would like to stop but montcalm will be 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.370
 never suddenly yeah I played every 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.439
 days we will say that I already have 450 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.870
 hours of people he went out in November 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.430
 shelled have a good performance 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.759
 individual which makes that my level has 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.900
 increases 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.849
 I had the impression that he had a 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.099
 little slack on ghost at the level 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.690
 of a little bit everything I do not do that we did not 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.210
 not too much the game was really not 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.550
 pleasant to play 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.919
 finally how to say the blade and current on 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.210
 the game was in vain is really making 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.949
 crazy you have it was everyone can 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.349
 to be good when it meant nothing 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.750
 ok so that in the evening to ignore it's a 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.759
 toothache you can talk to us a little bit 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.409
 weapon maps the down sides that 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.000
 make it a little better then 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.529
 which really changes everything about the game 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.449
 it's the dash ie it's a 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.069
 little to the halo a little double job it's up to 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.629
 say we can instead of doing only one 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.129
 jump on old opuses employment in 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.690
 so it really helps you 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.050
 do a lot of moov the right tactic 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.940
 etc. 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.620
 the dash as it allows to have 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.240
 a lot more fluidity in the game the 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.740
 much more fluid game also the 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.110
 armies are less balanced apart 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.089
 one after a patch that is to say that 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.349
 times positively screaming condé set to 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:56.849
 day ie the asm has now 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.770
 it's a weapon that's a bit similar 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.789
 to victory over the objects do you have 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.379
 really much faster than 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.150
 some others why that's what 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.589
 it's a little near what everyone 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.539
 uses everyone uses a vector 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:08.789
 with a maintenance and the asm in real and 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:12.360
 with the basler got both arms the 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.639
 younger ok ok ok good listening 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.660
 thank you for having me a little bit 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.550
 tense 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.780
 we are soon on millennium 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.880
 for others or other videos 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.260
 other things about on call of duty 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.260
 See you soon and thanks
