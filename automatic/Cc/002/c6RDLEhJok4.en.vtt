 Greetings to all who are in the humor 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.520
 lingering repair history and 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.160
 continues to flip with us 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.430
 encyclopedia department hi our 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.920
 close attention again walls 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.500
 large areas and a whole deck of options 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.439
 Andrei lay out choose well 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.899
 queen queen decoration decorative 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.390
 plaster beats all records have none 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.399
 one 10 decorative wallcoverings 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.949
 both indoors and outdoors, and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.480
 combination of incompatible 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.180
 decorative pictorial colorful 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.699
 fancy and plaster mass is thick 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.230
 sand mortar adds 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.690
 paint solution with different inclusions 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.089
 leaflet particles or repeating texture 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.149
 wood fabrics can be made smooth 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.399
 surface and simulate walls 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.839
 mud houses but there are these miracles 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 Today, of course, remember that 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.200
 leveling the surface after priming 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.870
 we put plaster 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 then putty today is the last stage 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.350
 we do not need to be primed as usual 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.620
 roller or brush 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.480
 true primer is not quite that 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.580
 pigmented white paint she is 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.580
 different packing worse ready to use 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.520
 the primer is dry and open 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 we work with decorative plaster 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 gives an additional effect of volume 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.980
 notice if you combine 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.780
 decorative plaster from earlier 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.000
 laid tile use 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.190
 masking tape to surround the ends 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.240
 artificial stone left clean 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 after completion of work 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.230
