 so thanks to us guys 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.610
 we obviously accepted theirs 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.950
 offer and just 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.899
 so obviously we are now taking a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.729
 funny village of a clan member and not 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:52.729
 they saw and we put more o 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.789
 minus all beautiful resources 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.970
 hours of elixir plus city hall out like this 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.979
 We can offer his opponent 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.840
 of its two stars not even his 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.819
 of the stars of its one star 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.090
 because it destroys muncipio and his 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.160
 resources and related erratic is seen thus 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.629
 we have gained so many resources because 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.670
 then I have won the award because 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.470
 they had squalid villages where 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.879
 it was very easy to make two stars look 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.430
 well this bwv sharing is wonderful and 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.769
 sensational to wage war like that between bambers 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.790
 accelerated the children's villages between 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.769
 the other thanks to this we have 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.510
 made a lot of experience because 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.010
 you must know that if you have a lot 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.470
 experience increase your level 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.330
 kaneko quickly gets the level of the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.819
 clans are facts you earn a bang of 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.099
 experience now I don't know but them 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.470
 they are at level 3 of experience and clan 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.610
 I don't know how many they will do, but I am 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.269
 still at the train level and I'm still 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.250
 level 2 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.080
 it does not matter to also increase the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.580
 fast clan level guys there 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.200
 I also recommend silvi as a buzzer 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.990
 advice because how much yours knows 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 club level 2 vanello we do so many 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.290
 norcia 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.879
 le work to record me and that's it 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.069
 we are all alone on a notch 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.810
 bows such that we attack perfect well 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.800
 then to make many resources thanks 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.690
 what I don't want to do 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.480
 many now even if you lose them, do it 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.540
 do it because you like now show now 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.880
 see here you gain anyway 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.459
 of experience as well as making 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.500
 stars in this case today is a bit funny 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.610
 funny but because he says fucking about 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.769
 cod city is reflecting anyway 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.690
 you earn in only 50 of experience 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.250
 which is not so much in relation to those 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 that you earn in total in the war 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.000
 therefore it is not bad it is not bad to make some 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.410
 so sure wars if you have to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.230
 go against people who 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.720
 they understand that you want to wage war 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.480
 so stupid you really me reason 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.980
 I don't know if doing so is also good 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.400
 idea in the sense that the super can 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.019
 blocking may be but no but look 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.120

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.799
