00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.550
 how about friends how are i am ryder 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.490
 here with another new video more this time 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.990
 I want to show you something that is a 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.790
 problem that has this door I do not know if 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.400
 they remember the tutorial that I brought them 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.860
 how to make a very compact door 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.510
 with pistons that is this and how can 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.699
 see already with the little house made with a 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.170
 simple house is pretty good 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.879
 very cool door and we have a 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.720
 room although it seems jail its 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.059
 get out and well the door is very 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.220
 well as you can see but it has a 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.290
 problem that I was even mentioned 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.610
 in this tutorial if you have not seen the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.809
 tutorial will be in the description 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.360
 so you go and see it is very easy 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.420
 to do but have a problem and they are 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.449
 these plates here can perfectly 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.790
 come a clip but a zombie or whatever 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.189
 at night already in survival mode you can 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.610
 enter perfectly and shit not in 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.650
 our house 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.810
 and the problem is these plates that are 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.060
 out why what we do 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.230
 now is to solve that problem how 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.030
 we can solve that and so not that 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.530
 do not come kripper chickens and things like that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.490
 so they are not opening and closing 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.189
 the door 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.970
 what we are going to do is remove these 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.530
 plates 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.670
 and right there we are going to finish 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.659
 four blocks four blocks well 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.659
 we also remove these from here 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.790
 it's fine I think 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.180
 Now what we are going to do is remove 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.910
 these four of the redstone 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.630
 and put a block next to the other 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.590
 thus a here and here to stay down 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.770
 from the wall there now what are we going to 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.659
 to do is to put 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.369
 one of redstone here and another here and we put 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.220
 a button here and that is going to serve 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.770
 so that the doors can be opened 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.740
 how can you see 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.990
 already perfectly works like this and here 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.090
 we can put another one that also sold 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.980
 doing the function 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.739
 and then this would already be solved 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.060
 problem that we do not have to be 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.580
 thinking that a pri can enter but 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.030
 something 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.110
 and we can close 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.580
 I already thought it would not work so 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.280
 normally if I put a block here it 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.380
 I would cut the current with the rest but 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.800
 I do not know if it 's a mistake or what but it does not happen 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.170
 nothing can I put blocks perfectly and 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.060
 It can 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.770
 and that would solve the problem 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.410
 problem of the plates so we can 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.830
 enter with buttons sorry 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.019
 it looks very good 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.420
 as you can see I am going to enter 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.849
 it closes perfectly and I hope so 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.639
 that you liked this video and can 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.099
 be like a second part of that door 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:15.060
 and nothing then leave your comment its like 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.060
 And until next time
