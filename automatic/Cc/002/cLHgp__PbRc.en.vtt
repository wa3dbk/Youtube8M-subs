well<00:00:01.920> now<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.460> I've<00:00:02.520> got<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:02.730> computer<00:00:03.120> built

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
well now that I've got my computer built

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.170 
well now that I've got my computer built
I'm<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> test<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:05.040> then<00:00:05.339> compared<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.819> my

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
I'm going to test it then compared to my

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.950 
I'm going to test it then compared to my
old<00:00:06.210> system<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.710> new<00:00:08.160> computers<00:00:08.760> hooked<00:00:09.750> up

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
old system the new computers hooked up

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.190 
old system the new computers hooked up
to<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> monitor<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.460> left<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:13.049> old

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
to the monitor on the left and the old

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.609 
to the monitor on the left and the old
is<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.130> monitor<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> right<00:00:15.260> I'm<00:00:16.260> going

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
is on the monitor on the right I'm going

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.599 
is on the monitor on the right I'm going
to<00:00:16.770> start<00:00:17.400> two<00:00:17.609> systems<00:00:18.830> together<00:00:19.830> at<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
to start two systems together at the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.500 
to start two systems together at the
same<00:00:20.789> time<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.369> we'll<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.699> how<00:00:23.910> quick<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
same time and we'll see how quick the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:01:01.070 
same time and we'll see how quick the
boot<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.830> we're<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> start<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.439> now

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.020 

and<00:01:02.080> the<00:01:02.770> new<00:01:02.980> one<00:01:03.220> is<00:01:03.250> up<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:03.820> running

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
and the new one is up and running

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
and the new one is up and running
already

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
already

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.380 
already
let's<00:01:06.070> see<00:01:06.370> how<00:01:06.460> much<00:01:06.640> longer<00:01:06.970> it<00:01:07.180> will<00:01:07.210> be

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
let's see how much longer it will be

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.100 
let's see how much longer it will be
before<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:09.040> old<00:01:09.880> one<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.300> up<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.600> running<00:01:10.840> and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
before the old one is up and running and

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:31.380 
before the old one is up and running and
ready<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.440> go

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:41.090 

I'm<00:01:32.390> still<00:01:32.810> waiting

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.030 

almost<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:43.909> there<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.150> are

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
almost there there we are

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.790 
almost there there we are
that<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.190> quite<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.729> longer<00:01:47.909> than<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.800> new

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
that was quite a bit longer than the new

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.240 
that was quite a bit longer than the new
one

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.190 

and<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.430> now<00:01:57.580> let's<00:01:57.610> compare<00:01:58.180> how<00:01:58.240> quickly<00:01:58.870> we

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and so now let's compare how quickly we

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.880 
and so now let's compare how quickly we
can<00:02:00.180> boot<00:02:01.180> up<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.540> program<00:02:01.840> I'm<00:02:02.440> going<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.680> use

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
can boot up a program I'm going to use

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.060 
can boot up a program I'm going to use
my<00:02:03.630> Vegas<00:02:04.630> movie<00:02:04.960> studio<00:02:04.990> Platinum<00:02:05.920> that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
my Vegas movie studio Platinum that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.600 
my Vegas movie studio Platinum that
usually<00:02:06.340> takes<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.730> while<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.530> start<00:02:08.530> up<00:02:08.920> as<00:02:09.399> I

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
usually takes a while to start up as I

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.530 
usually takes a while to start up as I
said<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.650> new<00:02:11.650> computer<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.820> one<00:02:13.270> on<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
said the new computer is the one on the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.240 
said the new computer is the one on the
left<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.140> on<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.470> right<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> old

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
left and on the right is the old

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.550 
left and on the right is the old
computer<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.570> I'm<00:02:16.720> going<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.930> click<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.410> them

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
computer so I'm going to click on them

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.520 
computer so I'm going to click on them
both<00:02:17.770> at<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.190> same<00:02:18.400> time<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.140> let's<00:02:20.140> see

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
both at the same time and let's see

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:30.630 
both at the same time and let's see
which<00:02:20.830> one<00:02:21.190> will<00:02:21.630> load<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.810> quickest<00:02:29.640> well

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
which one will load the quickest well

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:44.040 
which one will load the quickest well
that<00:02:30.850> was<00:02:31.000> quick<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.330> status<00:02:43.780> very

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
that was quick and the status very

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:58.360 
that was quick and the status very
slowly<00:02:44.350> moving<00:02:44.920> there<00:02:45.610> we<00:02:45.820> go

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.449 

and<00:02:58.879> there<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.239> have<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.769> much<00:03:00.769> much<00:03:01.129> slower

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
and there you have it much much slower

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.200 
and there you have it much much slower
the<00:03:02.180> old<00:03:02.390> computer<00:03:03.019> is
