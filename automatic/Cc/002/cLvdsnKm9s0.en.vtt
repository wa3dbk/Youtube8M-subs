00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 hi everyone guys are white and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:12.980
 today I will do a tutorial to use 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:28.140
 the best of snom 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:31.529
 then for more what we open then 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.739
 first I'll show you how 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.770
 opening up the Rome is a game what it is 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.770
 has 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:52.770
 select the game I don't open one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 what for few but ok now will start the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.550
 game then to save little to get the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.309
 game to save you have to save from here 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.689
 only the state as and not save state 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.330
 because when you will save from here and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.170
 would help de smuju then just do it 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.420
 you will have to reopen therefore it will not load 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.210
 you have to start over 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.180
 instead sello saved from here among the past 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.240
 as I know ipad with the name de salvo e 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.360
 then when should you do different carlo 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 load to state to be loaded on 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.670
 rescue and took it and the game is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 done 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:49.650
 then as regards the volume for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.960
 remove the volume then expected 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:59.050
 the for volume pains to his 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.590
 configuration settings sound and from 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.320
 here in this window in this 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:13.930
 window that will pop me up go up 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:17.860
 this in volume and depend and depends 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.230
 how much you want to decrease the I 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.680
 past photos you have and the volume is not there 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:31.860
 it will be more then for checks 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.230
 then for the control of the games 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.260
 then set up and then 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.950
 configures control scooters in August 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.230
 window that will serve to which will be i 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:50.470
 ie keyboard meals 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.910
 play will be like those of the ds 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.780
 therefore I put them like those of the ds 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:03.070
 not to confuse me then you do yourself 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.959
 then the tongue 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.800
 usually when unloaded of the world 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.840
 will be in English out to put it 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.730
 italian you have to do configuration 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:25.450
 language and here will be the various languages 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:30.000
 and ok then then nothing passes to do 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:39.480
 a video to record you have to go on 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:43.930
 avi log file click us save the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.320
 this one you save that would be the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.320
 video 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:57.850
 here in this window you must 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:02.890
 select a practically will serve 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:07.090
 I don't use video to make videos with 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.740
 space so I don't use it then 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.090
 you do 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:18.720
 microsoft and video but anyway 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:23.230
 select an option here do ok vi 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.250
 will then start recording to stop 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.240
 video 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.560
 do go on file here will be there 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.140
 written stop to you stop and save the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.740
 video and that's it 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:44.230
 then another thing in that the codes i 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.200
 therefore many pieces are in great demand 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.750
 much used now I will show you 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.960
 how to use them 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.870
 since then to use the master codes 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.520
 I look at the site of the codes of 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:06.400
 pokÃ©mon white 2 then you do then 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:20.580
 looked for other sites I do not know we go on the 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:20.580
 site that would be this 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:34.260
 games.it scene for which there will be the seas 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:43.220
 shards glasses but not in and let's try 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:43.220
 the one I know we do 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.010
 let's do this I see a hundred of the first 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:59.450
 subject of the inventory selection on 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.450
 code make your own network on facebook 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:07.260
 let's go over emulation of list codes e 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.840
 will play this window then 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.110
 now to enter the trick 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.910
 we have to go on action replay that 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:20.160
 will be here this window will answer 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.060
 we glue the coach and on this 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.560
 blank space 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:29.520
 ok and we put in the area here the name of the 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.330
 trick of being well over 900 for those 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:38.910
 parental objects 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:44.720
 ok let's add we put safe ok 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.720
 now let's load I play 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.440
 lot 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:00.110
 ok then now i'll show you that the 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:04.010
 trick will work wonders 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:07.220
 look I forgot to activate 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.620
 we have to do this trick 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.370
 keep appreciated more 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.590
 r therefore we consider lent for some 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:22.790
 second 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:27.380
 we let them go on the bag look 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:33.230
 here is the same 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:38.320
 you have seen nine hundred this will be alone 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:43.760
 for the first inventory project 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:48.110

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:57.710
 just how to make them work 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:08:02.030
 and then nothing your name is mom there 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:04.670
