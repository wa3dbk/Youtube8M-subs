up the background of the behind the ball
and<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> screwdriver<00:01:02.309> stuff

and all those things but if I turn them
off<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.450> can't<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.590> anything<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
you can see on the screen right now and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.749 
you can see on the screen right now and
as<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.960> captured<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.740> image<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.520> see

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
as I captured one image and you can see

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
as I captured one image and you can see
there<00:01:21.000> are<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> lot<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> noises<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:23.159> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
there are a lot of noises and there is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.440 
there are a lot of noises and there is
no<00:01:24.259> clarity<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.860> pics<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:27.420> a

no clarity and pics there there are a
lot<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> pixelation<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:29.790> can't<00:01:30.060> see

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
lot of pixelation and you can't see

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.230 
lot of pixelation and you can't see
image<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.290> properly<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.310> lighting

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
image very properly in this lighting

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.510 
image very properly in this lighting
condition<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.380> want<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> capture<00:01:35.280> these

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
condition if you want to capture these

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
condition if you want to capture these
kind<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.030> objects<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> light

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
kind of objects in this kind of light

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.280 
kind of objects in this kind of light
then<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.759> need<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.090> configure<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.930> bit

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
then you just need to configure it a bit

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.340 
then you just need to configure it a bit
like<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.549> am<00:01:41.610> trying<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.450> configure<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
like in this I am trying to configure it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
like in this I am trying to configure it
with<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.740> slow<00:01:43.979> shutter<00:01:44.009> speed<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
with the slow shutter speed if you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
with the slow shutter speed if you
adjust<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> slow<00:01:46.229> shutter<00:01:46.439> speed<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> 8

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
adjust the slow shutter speed to 8

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160 
adjust the slow shutter speed to 8
seconds<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.759> means<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.390> we're<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> delay

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
seconds it means it we're going to delay

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649 
seconds it means it we're going to delay
the<00:01:49.200> shutter<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.950> close<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.549> observe<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the shutter to close and observe the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.050 
the shutter to close and observe the
light<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> eight<00:01:52.409> seconds<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.909> we're

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
light for the eight seconds so if we're

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660 
light for the eight seconds so if we're
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.390> absorb<00:01:55.290> every<00:01:55.710> single<00:01:56.130> amount<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
going to absorb every single amount of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.999 
going to absorb every single amount of
light<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.200> falling<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.799> this

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
light which is right now falling on this

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.130 
light which is right now falling on this
object<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.610> after<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.659> need<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
object and after that you just need to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.580 
object and after that you just need to
go<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> slow<00:02:01.770> shutter<00:02:01.979> mode<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:03.030> tap<00:02:03.299> on

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
go to slow shutter mode and just tap on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.959

good compared to that one for further

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.330 
good compared to that one for further
more<00:02:30.599> brightness<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.349> exposure<00:02:31.739> Union<00:02:32.160> you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
more brightness and exposure Union you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.570 
more brightness and exposure Union you
can<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.880> adjust<00:02:33.380> ISO<00:02:34.380> settings<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.550> a

can just adjust ISO settings and get a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.970 
can just adjust ISO settings and get a
pretty<00:02:35.880> much<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> very<00:02:36.420> nice<00:02:36.690> image<00:02:37.050> as<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.920> am

adjusting the ISO to the maximum which

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.030 
adjusting the ISO to the maximum which
is<00:02:45.420> ISO<00:02:46.019> 1600<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.220> or<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.870> can<00:02:49.080> choose<00:02:49.590> any<00:02:49.890> of

and after that captured the image you

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.700 
and after that captured the image you
will<00:03:01.060> see<00:03:01.090> pretty<00:03:01.570> much<00:03:01.720> an<00:03:01.930> improvement<00:03:02.440> in

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
will see pretty much an improvement in

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.570 
will see pretty much an improvement in
exposure<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.460> lighting<00:03:03.490> as<00:03:04.270> you<00:03:04.570> can<00:03:04.750> see<00:03:04.990> now

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
exposure and lighting as you can see now

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.150 
exposure and lighting as you can see now
the<00:03:06.580> image<00:03:06.850> got<00:03:07.150> very<00:03:07.510> bright<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.770> is

having<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.590> lot<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.890> exposure<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.330> play

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
having a lot of exposure so just play

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330 
having a lot of exposure so just play
around<00:03:19.630> with<00:03:19.900> these<00:03:20.110> settings<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.800> get<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
around with these settings and get the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.480 
around with these settings and get the
better<00:03:21.520> image<00:03:21.880> now<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.810> will<00:03:23.140> going<00:03:23.350> to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
better image now I will going to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.930 
better image now I will going to
decrease<00:03:24.490> ISO<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.660> bed<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.530> set<00:03:27.520> up<00:03:27.700> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
decrease ISO of bed as and set up the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.740 
decrease ISO of bed as and set up the
slow<00:03:28.570> shutter<00:03:28.780> speed<00:03:29.520> about<00:03:30.520> 8<00:03:30.910> second<00:03:31.420> or<00:03:31.540> 4

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
slow shutter speed about 8 second or 4

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.490 
slow shutter speed about 8 second or 4
seconds<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.870> am<00:03:34.900> going<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.290> set

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
seconds like in this I am going to set

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.850 
seconds like in this I am going to set
ISO<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> little<00:03:36.610> bit<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:38.140> go<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.530> put

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
ISO a little bit and in this I go to put

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.640 
ISO a little bit and in this I go to put
a<00:03:38.890> 4<00:03:39.340> second<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:40.000> slow<00:03:40.630> shutter<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.200> capture
