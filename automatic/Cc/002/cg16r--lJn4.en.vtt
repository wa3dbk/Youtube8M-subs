00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
think it's such a beautiful art form and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.810 
think it's such a beautiful art form and
you<00:04:12.870> know<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.140> violin<00:04:13.620> traditionally<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.310> mean

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
you know the violin traditionally I mean

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.219 
you know the violin traditionally I mean
even<00:04:15.060> when<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.239> played<00:04:15.600> my<00:04:15.630> whole<00:04:15.959> life<00:04:16.200> growing

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
even when I played my whole life growing

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.800 
even when I played my whole life growing
up<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.919> could<00:04:17.100> never<00:04:17.400> move<00:04:17.700> while<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.000> played<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
up I could never move while I played and

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.080 
up I could never move while I played and
I<00:04:19.200> just<00:04:19.410> remember<00:04:19.680> thinking<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:20.280> want<00:04:20.549> to

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
I just remember thinking I want to

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.909 
I just remember thinking I want to
entertain<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.690> don't<00:04:21.989> want<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.260> just<00:04:22.440> impress

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
entertain I don't want to just impress

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.880 
entertain I don't want to just impress
and<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.419> wanted<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.020> add<00:04:25.200> movement<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.650> wanted

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
and so I wanted to add movement I wanted

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.170 
and so I wanted to add movement I wanted
it<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.190> be<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> visual

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
it to be a visual

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.060 
it to be a visual
erience<00:04:27.389> not<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.259> a<00:04:28.470> auditory<00:04:28.919> experience

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
erience not just a auditory experience

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.760 
erience not just a auditory experience
and<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:29.729> it's<00:04:29.880> been<00:04:29.970> really<00:04:30.090> fun<00:04:30.539> too<00:04:31.080> at<00:04:31.500> first

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
and so it's been really fun too at first

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.950 
and so it's been really fun too at first
it<00:04:31.949> was<00:04:32.039> very<00:04:32.220> awkward<00:04:32.280> very<00:04:32.820> very<00:04:33.300> hard<00:04:33.690> and

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
it was very awkward very very hard and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.680 
it was very awkward very very hard and
it<00:04:34.710> felt<00:04:34.919> impossible<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.669> after<00:04:36.030> doing<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.479> so

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690
