00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
over Master Chief that's the Infinity

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
over Master Chief that's the Infinity
and<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.270> foundation<00:00:36.450> from<00:00:37.170> which<00:00:37.230> all

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and that's the foundation from which all

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.889 
and that's the foundation from which all
of<00:00:37.860> our<00:00:38.010> multiplayer<00:00:38.460> experiences<00:00:39.270> are

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
of our multiplayer experiences are

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.240 
of our multiplayer experiences are
unleashed<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:43.230> literally<00:00:43.649> gonna<00:00:43.860> create

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
unleashed you literally gonna create

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
unleashed you literally gonna create
your<00:00:44.430> own<00:00:44.489> smart<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.600> own<00:00:45.719> soldier

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
your own smart in your own soldier

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
your own smart in your own soldier
you're<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> Infinity<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> guess

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you're on the Infinity and then I guess

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.369 
you're on the Infinity and then I guess
there's<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.420> two<00:00:48.539> paths<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.200> down

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
there's are two paths you can go down

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.900 
there's are two paths you can go down
you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:49.890> war<00:00:50.250> games<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you can go down war games which is a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
you can go down war games which is a
competitive<00:00:51.420> multiplayer<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.530> Spartan

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
competitive multiplayer and then Spartan

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.200 
competitive multiplayer and then Spartan
Ops<00:00:53.039> which<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> sort<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> more<00:00:53.940> narrative

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
Ops which is the sort of more narrative

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.830 
Ops which is the sort of more narrative
focused<00:00:54.780> co-op<00:00:55.079> exactly<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> war<00:00:56.340> games<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
focused co-op exactly so war games is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.330 
focused co-op exactly so war games is
essentially<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.079> training<00:00:58.710> exercise<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
essentially a training exercise that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.029 
essentially a training exercise that
allows<00:00:59.640> Spartans<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.899> heading<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> combat

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
allows Spartans to heading to combat

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
allows Spartans to heading to combat
against<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.489> another<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> combat<00:01:03.449> deck

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
against one another on the combat deck

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
against one another on the combat deck
and<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.290> Spartan<00:01:04.799> Ops<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> cooperative

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and then Spartan Ops is a cooperative

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.719 
and then Spartan Ops is a cooperative
episodic<00:01:06.750> experience<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:08.130> each<00:01:08.460> week

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
episodic experience where each week

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.580 
episodic experience where each week
we're<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> new<00:01:09.720> episode<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
we're going to have a new episode of a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
we're going to have a new episode of a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
able to invest in this group of

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
able to invest in this group of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
characters that are aboard the Infinity

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.679 
characters that are aboard the Infinity
and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:16.860> we'll<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.130> five<00:01:17.549> missions<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and then we'll have five missions that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
and then we'll have five missions that

let's talk about the narrative links

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.600

between<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.420> these<00:01:30.540> different<00:01:30.600> elements<00:01:31.050> of

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
between all these different elements of

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
between all these different elements of
halo<00:01:32.610> because<00:01:32.940> for<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.180> first<00:01:33.210> time<00:01:33.480> it<00:01:34.230> feels

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
halo because for the first time it feels

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.750 
halo because for the first time it feels
like<00:01:34.560> multiplayer<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.460> gonna<00:01:35.550> have<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
like multiplayer is really gonna have a

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.000 
like multiplayer is really gonna have a
story<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> evolves<00:01:36.840> over<00:01:37.140> time<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.830> made<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
story that evolves over time we made a

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.530 
story that evolves over time we made a
decision<00:01:38.160> about<00:01:38.460> three<00:01:38.760> years<00:01:38.940> ago<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
decision about three years ago that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.760 
decision about three years ago that
we're<00:01:39.690> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> make<00:01:39.990> sure<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.410> instead<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
we're going to make sure that instead of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.210 
we're going to make sure that instead of
us<00:01:41.390> segmenting<00:01:42.390> off<00:01:42.540> stories<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.410> putting

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
us segmenting off stories and putting
