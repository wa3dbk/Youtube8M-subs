that I'm installing last video I

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.020 
that I'm installing last video I
demonstrated<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.950> differences<00:00:11.519> between<00:00:11.700> the

in<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> factory<00:00:17.039> pump<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.690> obtained<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.900> new

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
in the factory pump I obtained a new

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.620 
in the factory pump I obtained a new
pump<00:00:20.510> this<00:00:21.510> world<00:00:21.810> parts<00:00:22.199> pump<00:00:23.420> here's<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
pump this world parts pump here's the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.009 
pump this world parts pump here's the
part<00:00:24.869> number<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:26.570> they<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.810> from<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
part number on it they got this from a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.410 
part number on it they got this from a
local<00:00:28.320> parts<00:00:28.560> towards<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> brand<00:00:29.099> new<00:00:29.310> pump<00:00:29.580> we

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
local parts towards a brand new pump we

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.849 
local parts towards a brand new pump we
measured<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> thickness<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> pump<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
measured the thickness of the pump and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.520 
measured the thickness of the pump and
gasket<00:00:32.430> together<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.360> were<00:00:33.469> they<00:00:34.469> were

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
gasket together and they were they were

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.380 
gasket together and they were they were
the<00:00:34.680> same<00:00:34.860> thickness<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.370> OE<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.210> only

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the same thickness as the OE the only

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.410 
the same thickness as the OE the only
difference<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.989> had<00:00:37.770> metal<00:00:38.250> impeller<00:00:38.790> as

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
difference was had metal impeller as

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.410 
difference was had metal impeller as
opposed<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.110> plastic<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:42.239> it's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
opposed to this plastic one I think it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
opposed to this plastic one I think it's
going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.690> too<00:00:42.840> big<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> deal<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:44.190> come<00:00:44.399> over

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
going to be too big a deal you come over

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.569 
going to be too big a deal you come over
here<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.739> our<00:00:48.770> pump<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.039> pub<00:00:50.219> has<00:00:50.370> been

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
here and see our pump the pub has been

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
here and see our pump the pub has been
installed<00:00:51.590> with<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> gasket<00:00:53.149> but<00:00:54.149> torque<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
installed with the gasket but torque to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.549 
installed with the gasket but torque to
spec<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:57.210> thought<00:00:57.570> everything<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.109> great

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
