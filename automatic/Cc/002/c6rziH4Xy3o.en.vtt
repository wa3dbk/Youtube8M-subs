00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.800
 Well, this time, what kind of character do you use in raid mode on what stage 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.330
 I wonder 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:18.830
 Well it is this time Well, that is the Hey play is a stage called Lovely jar 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.539
 I think what to show because I want to show you say that you have a pretty eat meet 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.539
 Yao a little more difficult 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.920
 Was done 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.720
 Yes' s 58 people Nee 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.779
 In towards the player 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.160
 I'm leaving with the thought that I will only say the equipment 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:39.399
 A high degree of difficulty and an opportunity to let everyone see action 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.399
 Players will also play at very high levels 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.930
 I think you came out Hunter 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.850
 It is a roller yce place, yes it is that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.430
 The customer has become a model 5 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 Ringer is so something can buy those who mind fit 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.050
 It will be increasingly left 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.240
 Something 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.320
 Everyone is playing with something rare about me, but if you don't do it you will die 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 this 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.200
 Kedomo I wonder if even the kind to choose 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.740
 I place called a game resistant It is often crunchy I think that Dondake 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.290
 I think I want to ask you by all means challenge also it is where do say so we had 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.420
 A little home page 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.980
 Not found 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.960
 It went much 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:32.550
 I don't want that relief, I guess that's a face mark. 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.060
 Target towards the left of the Way of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.250
 It This key's is a legacy point of view maybe you were before in towards the pet 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.680
 Thank you 2 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.200
 me 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.930
 Do you think that if you have m Mr. cage 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.730
 Because it can be used with a single button, it is a pinch time 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.140
 Well 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.070
 By him 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.070
 It is good against 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.820
 Say I have to go it is also that companies legislators but it is intuition and uncool is 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.680
 Please Gabba Kedomo it does not show Good Points um 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.370
 Unlike this prefecture, this time the enemy's physical strength is displayed in this raid mode. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.250
 Information is 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.270
 I will be caught up to go as it is yeah I think this time I still have that part 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.240
 It will be another great pleasure to put in 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.640
 It was not the next clothes and how long I got it 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.470
 It is love bar to be easy to understand 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.730
 It is damage when it entered 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.180
 It is supposed to be displayed 8 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.240
 As its minute action game 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.830
 As a different game of Montpueter 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.830
 You are making well, so this is 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.990
 Yaguchi Makoto 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.990
 I agree 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.500
 Because the people of this time is Hey campaign mode is a horror display of such forms at all 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.550
 Even though it does not come out 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.930
 I say this sounds too good to be considered the game of the raid mode wind of the still is 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.180
 He devised differently in that it would end up 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.350
 In 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.660
 Even easier to understand information 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.110
 If the design of various ui interface only for raid mode is given 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.110

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.020

 It has that happened up to now 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.730
 I think that's about how much you play in this state 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.269
 Discharged hospital 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.580

 I think that I will strengthen 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.099
 I thought there was this machine 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:48.520
 It seems that no one can die but no real 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.520
 One game settings and even carefully selected the game exhilaration 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.790
 When Mr. Nakatani can do it now 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.790
 Should I Kabusere I'm uneasy 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.030
 Just not that such a thing is 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:11.379
 Let's say it's time to stop It's because it's about to die. 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:13.900
 I will show you Hyakusama Sukarumirione to Shouchinami is Kore 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.969

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.700
 Haiku 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:22.660
 While also various new information 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.660
 I live the game 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.360

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.510
 Yes, here I'm on top of the building is the goal point 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.390
 Harvest was also out 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.940
 It is said that there is a sense of transparency 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.930
 It is a hunter who can mimic in the new 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.220
 I really have this stage 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:49.520
 It's a stage where strong opponents are stepping in line here 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:53.539
 Also much Tteyuu'll be cleared in It is a campaign mode of it is price Hell 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.660
 If you want to do it, it's an artist new It is a difficulty, but play 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:06:00.740
 I think you want 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.840
 The implication degree of competition of the game say to have entered 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.420
 Stupid 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.710
 It is recommended visit have taken one cheap store 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.960
 It is said that casual normal at the beginning of that once 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.400
 Depending on the fact that if there is a degree of difficulty to clear it once 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.400
 What is the mode on campus? 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:26.820
 Well, that's Nintendo 3ds 

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:28.300
 By Although that is a mobile game for you that I put out a video up to this point that 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.889
 very 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.240
 the same 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.240
 I wonder if some people are surprised 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:40.969
 So it's hard because you make games with good play so far 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:52.490
 Please do not be such desperate, please during black system change of chan 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.490

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:04.409
 It's kind of funny but I would like to say a little more 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.560
 First time or time 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:10.940

 A truly breathtaking deployment high that 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:20.180
 The main part is not such a style game, but this time this action part 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:25.430
 In but for you to see that I mean for such integrated What is it in everyone's 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.849
