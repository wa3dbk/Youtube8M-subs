00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.100
 and today we want to present you the cable m hl 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.759
 which is the cable mhl the famous cable for 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.480
 connect web and exact hdmi to the 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.919
 TV 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.019
 we have many people on facebook 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.630
 wondering why there is so much 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.800
 a lot of difference in price we can 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.300
 see ones that cost 5 or 10 dollars 1520 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.860
 personally said up to $ 45 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.100
 they have not got what is the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.600
 difference davis explained today we want 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.190
 explain to you that it is the cable to message it 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.990
 it is the cable of us that we 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:40.460
 We have in stores with three cable cables 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:43.129
 hdmi is the one who goes to the TV 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.510
 the cable that goes to the phone there I'm going to 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.770
 stopping this heat is simple and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.710
 what you are going to do is simply 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.420
 connect it to the same charging port with 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.420
 the only difference that the cable that 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.390
 we have brings what is 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.840
 converted the 5-pin to a brush in 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.940
 store 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.900
 here we have for example connected a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.660
 galaxy s 5 in the s5 we have to use that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.610
 the connector because the cable is 11 pins 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.080
 never spoke a little bit basically the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.420
 same cable but a little bit a little 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680
 longer to the naked eye it would be it would be 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.500
 the detail of what we were seeing 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 without him it will not work for that 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 I have so many people who tell me to look with 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.020
 ask somewhere on the internet 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.520
 wherever I bought it, it did not work for me 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.590
 we can see many internet 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.440
 many models but they are not for 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.310
 all the phones you will have to buy 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.080
 specifically that of your phone to 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.130
 what works is that we have 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.780
 It has a lot of variety you can tell me 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.670
 david me what I have a single phone 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.920
 yes but we always have family where 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 where they have other types of phones and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.670
 we have with these cables we have a lot 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420
 more possibility of connecting in other 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.460
 units as I know if my phone works 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.350
 with the adsl cable that speaks mhl 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.640
 we could say for you to me 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.140
 I could easily understand that it is a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.580
 connection as plus 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.680
 there are those who have the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.860
 bluetooth phones you always 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.670
 simply to go with your consumption 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.550
 of expose his model and can put m 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.830
 hl compatible and it will indicate if 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.350
 you do not have that compatibility or 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.150
 it does not matter what the mhm does not have 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.020
 as it might have a phone 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 50 dollars and have it 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.450
 how do we connect it on average? 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.760
 TV 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.099
 already wins in the microusb cable that is the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.319
 that goes to the phone but is fine 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.590
 important many people have reached us 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.420
 with cables that have these two tips 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.989
 but what happens when you put the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.300
 true phone to project the battery 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.980
 he eats it super fast because what 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.349
 the high definition video is happening and 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.760
 where does this cable come from this cable 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.500
 you are going to be surprised the one of 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.959
 phone so that while 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.430
 you are watching in the videos true 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.290
 the phone 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.930
 the phone can charge if it's not going 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.040
 to shut up the battery less than an hour 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.769
 so those are the differences more 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.200
 the three very important 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.989
 cables and it was up to the for 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.780
 compatibility of older phones as well 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.760
 that analyze well see well see the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.219
 difference in price quality knows that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.569
 all customers can pass by here 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.340
 that come to us we others 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.599
 we can try it so go to sure 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.849
 if it works for them doing seclusion 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.769
 doing them works not imposed here 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.329
 It stays the same work if they take 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.830
 take it away anything that ends up 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.980
 it has no guarantee has everything here 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.640
 very important 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.260
 the 1995 price can go through here 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.269
 Many people have told us that they have 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.569
 bought up to $ 45 can not fit 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.830
 pay more pass here only 1995 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.360
 where what we follow can happen with 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.360
