but<00:00:05.930> I<00:00:05.960> did<00:00:06.290> I<00:00:06.590> don't<00:00:07.010> know<00:00:07.070> if<00:00:07.160> you<00:00:07.250> can<00:00:07.430> see

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
but I did I don't know if you can see

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.629 
but I did I don't know if you can see
this<00:00:07.970> or<00:00:08.210> not<00:00:08.950> there<00:00:09.950> you<00:00:10.070> go<00:00:10.219> there's<00:00:10.400> a<00:00:10.490> good

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
this or not there you go there's a good

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.440 
this or not there you go there's a good
shot<00:00:10.910> I<00:00:11.290> used<00:00:12.290> some<00:00:12.530> 30

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
shot I used some 30

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.929 
shot I used some 30
paper<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.769> I<00:00:16.950> 90<00:00:17.950> degrees<00:00:18.250> to<00:00:18.279> each<00:00:18.460> other<00:00:18.730> but

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
paper and I 90 degrees to each other but

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.230 
paper and I 90 degrees to each other but
instead<00:00:19.660> of<00:00:19.840> 90<00:00:20.260> I<00:00:20.410> did<00:00:20.830> it<00:00:20.950> at<00:00:21.099> a<00:00:21.130> 45<00:00:21.820> this<00:00:22.029> way

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
instead of 90 I did it at a 45 this way

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.220 
instead of 90 I did it at a 45 this way
45<00:00:22.930> this<00:00:23.140> way<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.680> then<00:00:24.750> horizontal<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:25.960> then

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
45 this way and then horizontal and then

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.800 
45 this way and then horizontal and then
vertical<00:00:26.830> so<00:00:27.099> there's<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:28.330> four<00:00:28.660> different

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
vertical so there's like four different

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.990 
vertical so there's like four different
scratchings<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:29.890> etchings<00:00:30.309> here<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.669> prevent

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
scratchings and etchings here to prevent

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.200 
scratchings and etchings here to prevent
the<00:00:31.210> bubbles<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:33.040> latching<00:00:33.370> on<00:00:33.790> with<00:00:34.090> the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
the bubbles from latching on with the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.130 
the bubbles from latching on with the
surface<00:00:34.600> adhesion<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.640> all<00:00:36.969> of<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.360> plates<00:00:37.809> in

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
surface adhesion so all of the plates in

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.799 
surface adhesion so all of the plates in
the<00:00:38.410> middle<00:00:38.880> which<00:00:39.880> is<00:00:40.059> where<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.390> production

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
the middle which is where the production

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.709 
the middle which is where the production
is<00:00:40.930> right<00:00:41.140> here<00:00:41.440> all<00:00:41.920> of<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.640> facing<00:00:43.180> sides<00:00:43.450> of

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
is right here all of the facing sides of

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.830 
is right here all of the facing sides of
these<00:00:43.840> both<00:00:44.260> sides<00:00:44.620> are<00:00:44.920> etched<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:45.940> rather

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
these both sides are etched so rather

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.730 
these both sides are etched so rather
than<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:48.160> with<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.640> a<00:00:48.910> wire<00:00:49.720> cable<00:00:50.290> down<00:00:50.470> in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
than going with it a wire cable down in

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
than going with it a wire cable down in
the<00:00:50.890> solution<00:00:51.579> is<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:53.260> hook<00:00:53.890> up<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.250> positive

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
the solution is to hook up the positive

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.780 
the solution is to hook up the positive
and<00:00:55.060> the<00:00:55.320> negative<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:57.040> get<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.400> up<00:00:57.520> out<00:00:57.730> of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
and the negative and get it up out of

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.580 
and the negative and get it up out of
the<00:00:58.060> solution<00:00:58.630> and<00:00:58.750> then<00:00:58.810> i<00:00:58.930> can<00:00:59.110> run<00:00:59.320> wire

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
the solution and then i can run wire

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.350 
the solution and then i can run wire
cables<00:01:00.130> from<00:01:00.579> there<00:01:00.850> here<00:01:01.120> they<00:01:01.239> are

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
cables from there here they are

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.530 
cables from there here they are
separated<00:01:01.960> this<00:01:02.260> one<00:01:02.470> is<00:01:02.560> untouched<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.670> here

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
separated this one is untouched and here

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.100 
separated this one is untouched and here
it<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:05.340> have<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.579> flatten<00:01:06.939> without<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:09.460> i

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it is have to flatten without these i

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.010 
it is have to flatten without these i
use<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.290> hammer<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.369> just<00:01:13.299> flatten<00:01:13.509> these<00:01:13.780> on

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
use the hammer and just flatten these on

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.230 
use the hammer and just flatten these on
the<00:01:14.140> anvil<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:14.979> real<00:01:15.310> quickly<00:01:15.520> or<00:01:15.850> cement

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
the anvil really real quickly or cement

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.219 
the anvil really real quickly or cement
whatever<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:17.710> are<00:01:17.979> flattened<00:01:18.399> out<00:01:18.520> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
whatever these are flattened out and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.649 
whatever these are flattened out and
this<00:01:20.229> too<00:01:20.560> once<00:01:21.549> that's<00:01:21.700> flattened<00:01:22.149> out<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.299> put

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
this too once that's flattened out I put

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.020 
this too once that's flattened out I put
it<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.229> vise<00:01:23.469> but<00:01:23.979> yeah<00:01:24.399> two<00:01:24.819> and<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:24.999> half

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
it in the vise but yeah two and a half

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.620 
it in the vise but yeah two and a half
bucks<00:01:25.389> stainless<00:01:26.049> steel<00:01:26.079> straps<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.119> we're

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
bucks stainless steel straps and we're

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.270 
bucks stainless steel straps and we're
good<00:01:28.780> see<00:01:29.139> what<00:01:29.170> happens<00:01:29.619> if<00:01:29.709> i<00:01:29.829> connect<00:01:30.159> that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
good see what happens if i connect that

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.370 
good see what happens if i connect that
neutral<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.819> both<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.299> create<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.020> little<00:01:32.229> bit

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
neutral to both and create a little bit

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.190 
neutral to both and create a little bit
more<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.740> neutral<00:01:32.920> plate<00:01:33.579> area<00:01:34.030> here<00:01:34.359> so

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
more of a neutral plate area here so

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.459 
more of a neutral plate area here so
we'll<00:01:35.319> see<00:01:35.789> one<00:01:36.789> last<00:01:37.030> quick<00:01:37.959> little<00:01:38.289> thing

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
we'll see one last quick little thing

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.879 
we'll see one last quick little thing
here<00:01:38.709> too<00:01:39.039> when<00:01:39.310> you're<00:01:39.429> working<00:01:39.639> with<00:01:39.969> these

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
here too when you're working with these

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:45.919 
here too when you're working with these
nylon<00:01:41.999> five<00:01:42.999> sixteenth<00:01:43.509> inch<00:01:43.719> nylon<00:01:44.729> thread

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
nylon five sixteenth inch nylon thread

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.179 
nylon five sixteenth inch nylon thread
you<00:01:46.929> have<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.200> be<00:01:47.289> real<00:01:47.499> careful<00:01:47.529> with<00:01:48.039> these

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
you have to be real careful with these

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.129 
you have to be real careful with these
stainless<00:01:48.490> steel<00:01:48.850> screws<00:01:48.999> or<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.899> will

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
stainless steel screws or you will

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.669 
stainless steel screws or you will
easily<00:01:50.590> strip<00:01:51.189> it<00:01:51.369> out<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.170> cut

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
easily strip it out and when you cut

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.789 
easily strip it out and when you cut
these<00:01:54.569> what<00:01:55.569> I<00:01:55.600> suggest<00:01:56.079> doing<00:01:56.259> what<00:01:56.619> works

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
these what I suggest doing what works

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.949 
these what I suggest doing what works
really<00:01:57.009> well<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.459> screw<00:01:57.969> another<00:01:58.359> two<00:01:58.719> on

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
really well is screw another two on

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.219 
really well is screw another two on
their<00:01:59.349> first<00:01:59.619> one<00:02:00.039> met<00:02:00.389> before<00:02:01.389> you<00:02:01.840> cut<00:02:02.109> it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
their first one met before you cut it

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.859 
their first one met before you cut it
usually<00:02:03.069> I<00:02:03.099> screw<00:02:03.459> to<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.729> screw<00:02:04.149> one<00:02:04.420> nut<00:02:04.630> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
usually I screw to I screw one nut and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.319 
usually I screw to I screw one nut and
then<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.590> other<00:02:05.619> nut<00:02:05.979> beyond<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.700> next<00:02:06.999> cut

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
then the other nut beyond the next cut

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.320 
then the other nut beyond the next cut
and<00:02:07.659> then<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.770> cut<00:02:09.069> your<00:02:09.280> piece<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.910> then<00:02:10.179> you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
and then you cut your piece and then you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.030 
and then you cut your piece and then you
unscrew<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.110> nut<00:02:11.230> when<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.560> get<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.920> end

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
unscrew the nut when you get to the end

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.680 
unscrew the nut when you get to the end
work<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.550> back<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.970> forth<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.360> couple<00:02:13.390> times

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
work it back and forth a couple times

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.890 
work it back and forth a couple times
it's<00:02:14.590> real<00:02:14.800> critical<00:02:15.300> okay<00:02:16.300> I'm<00:02:16.510> gonna<00:02:16.660> finish

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it's real critical okay I'm gonna finish

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.140 
it's real critical okay I'm gonna finish
putting<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.260> together<00:02:17.819> but<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.880> wanted<00:02:19.090> to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
putting this together but I wanted to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.980 
putting this together but I wanted to
show<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.450> these<00:02:20.050> nuts<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.370> different

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
show you these nuts is different

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.020 
show you these nuts is different
because<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.860> thickness<00:02:25.770> Viva<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:27.820> is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
because of the thickness Viva this is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.030 
because of the thickness Viva this is
the<00:02:28.180> jam<00:02:28.420> nut<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:28.960> j<00:02:29.650> am<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:32.380> reason<00:02:32.590> that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the jam nut here j am so the reason that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.920 
the jam nut here j am so the reason that
the<00:02:33.250> smack<00:02:33.730> uses<00:02:34.210> these<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.570> because<00:02:34.660> they're

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
the smack uses these is because they're

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.810 
the smack uses these is because they're
thinner<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.130> they<00:02:36.280> leave<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.520> better

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
thinner and so they leave a better

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.970 
thinner and so they leave a better
closer<00:02:37.360> spacing<00:02:37.840> without<00:02:38.320> being<00:02:38.530> too<00:02:38.710> far

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
closer spacing without being too far

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.470 
closer spacing without being too far
apart<00:02:39.130> what<00:02:40.030> we've<00:02:40.180> got<00:02:40.390> when<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.500> put<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.830> on

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
apart what we've got when you put it on

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.400 
apart what we've got when you put it on
you<00:02:43.480> put<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> two<00:02:43.990> holes<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.530> like<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:44.950> first

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
you put the two holes on like this first

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.470 
you put the two holes on like this first
and<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:47.680> bring<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.040> around<00:02:51.330> great<00:02:52.330> I'm

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
and then bring it around great I'm

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.710 
and then bring it around great I'm
tripping<00:02:52.900> out<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.230> state<00:02:53.860> when<00:02:54.070> it's<00:02:54.190> all<00:02:54.340> done

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
tripping out of state when it's all done

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.660 
tripping out of state when it's all done
wanted<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.750> show<00:02:55.960> a<00:02:55.990> couple<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.380> things<00:02:56.670> here's

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
wanted to show a couple of things here's

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.930 
wanted to show a couple of things here's
the<00:02:57.730> tone<00:02:58.230> flattened<00:02:59.230> out<00:02:59.350> the<00:03:00.220> neutral<00:03:00.670> you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
the tone flattened out the neutral you

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.030 
the tone flattened out the neutral you
can<00:03:01.150> see<00:03:01.390> I've<00:03:01.810> got<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.140> passing<00:03:02.590> all<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.920> way

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
can see I've got it passing all the way

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.850 
can see I've got it passing all the way
through<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.550> middle<00:03:03.880> there<00:03:04.090> i<00:03:04.120> think<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.690> just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
through the middle there i think it just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.720 
through the middle there i think it just
present<00:03:05.860> may<00:03:05.980> be<00:03:06.040> nicer<00:03:06.610> neutral<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.730> then

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
present may be nicer neutral and then

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.770 
present may be nicer neutral and then
listen<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:11.020> already<00:03:11.290> pre-bent<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:13.630> that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
listen and already pre-bent it so that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.270 
listen and already pre-bent it so that
it<00:03:13.870> fits<00:03:14.080> around<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:14.830> then<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.100> have<00:03:15.250> to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
it fits around but then you have to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.520 
it fits around but then you have to
straighten<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.970> up<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.110> can<00:03:17.290> put<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
straighten it up so that you can put a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.800 
straighten it up so that you can put a
piece<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.860> shrink<00:03:18.340> tubing<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.910> i've<00:03:19.510> tried

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
piece of shrink tubing and i've tried

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.560 
piece of shrink tubing and i've tried
electrical<00:03:20.800> tape<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.520> it<00:03:21.670> does<00:03:21.850> not<00:03:21.880> work<00:03:22.330> it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
electrical tape that it does not work it

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.380 
electrical tape that it does not work it
comes<00:03:22.810> off<00:03:22.990> in<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.350> caustic<00:03:23.800> soda<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.430> this

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
comes off in the caustic soda so this

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.870 
comes off in the caustic soda so this

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.090 
shrink tubing from Home Depot works
really<00:03:28.210> well<00:03:29.100> guarding<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.160> bender<00:03:31.110> 430<00:03:32.110> heat

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
really well guarding a bender 430 heat

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.340 
really well guarding a bender 430 heat
shrink<00:03:33.400> tubing<00:03:33.960> actually<00:03:34.960> this<00:03:35.050> one's<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
shrink tubing actually this one's the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.320 
shrink tubing actually this one's the
bigger<00:03:35.590> one<00:03:35.860> there's<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.090> next

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
bigger one there's a this is the next

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.460 
bigger one there's a this is the next
size<00:03:37.480> down<00:03:37.510> yeah<00:03:38.440> but<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:39.610> size<00:03:40.290> sure<00:03:41.290> is

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
size down yeah but this size sure is

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.070 
size down yeah but this size sure is
it's<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:41.830> next<00:03:42.070> size<00:03:42.220> down<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:43.450> size<00:03:43.720> fits

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
it's the next size down this size fits

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.430 
it's the next size down this size fits
perfectly<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:45.070> on<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:45.940> vent<00:03:46.270> tongs<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.260> then

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
perfectly on on this vent tongs and then

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.080 
perfectly on on this vent tongs and then
you<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.710> use<00:03:47.860> a<00:03:47.890> heat<00:03:48.190> then<00:03:48.370> shrink<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:48.880> up

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
you just use a heat then shrink that up

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.170 
you just use a heat then shrink that up
and<00:03:49.300> then<00:03:49.990> that<00:03:50.230> way<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.560> insulated<00:03:51.130> when<00:03:52.090> it

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
and then that way it's insulated when it

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.600 
and then that way it's insulated when it
goes<00:03:52.300> on<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.630> here<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:54.130> I'll<00:03:54.280> show<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.520> that

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
goes on to here and I'll show you that

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.670 
goes on to here and I'll show you that
in<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:55.030> minute<00:03:55.240> it's<00:03:56.020> be<00:03:56.170> careful<00:03:56.560> with

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
in just a minute it's be careful with

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.380 
in just a minute it's be careful with
this<00:03:56.740> shrink<00:03:57.070> tubing<00:03:57.430> too<00:03:57.700> because<00:03:58.090> if<00:03:58.270> you

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
this shrink tubing too because if you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.690 
this shrink tubing too because if you
put<00:03:58.420> too<00:03:58.600> much<00:03:58.840> heat<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.800> was<00:03:59.980> open<00:04:00.430> up<00:04:00.550> a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
put too much heat it was open up a

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.580 
put too much heat it was open up a
blow-up<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.570> hole<00:04:01.780> on<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:02.410> why<00:04:02.560> i

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
blow-up and a hole on it that's why i

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.330 
blow-up and a hole on it that's why i
don't<00:04:02.800> use<00:04:03.010> matches<00:04:03.450> she's<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.480> very<00:04:04.990> very<00:04:05.920> hot

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
don't use matches she's a very very hot

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.360 
don't use matches she's a very very hot
hair<00:04:06.910> dryer<00:04:07.150> or<00:04:07.270> a<00:04:07.480> heat<00:04:07.750> gun<00:04:07.960> and<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:09.220> will

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
hair dryer or a heat gun and it will

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.790 
hair dryer or a heat gun and it will
shrink<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.790> down<00:04:09.820> just<00:04:10.090> take<00:04:10.300> your<00:04:10.450> time

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
shrink it down just take your time

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.230 
shrink it down just take your time
shrink<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.890> down<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.220> insulates<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:12.880> real<00:04:13.060> nice

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
shrink it down it insulates it real nice

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.039 
shrink it down it insulates it real nice
and<00:04:13.590> then<00:04:14.590> just<00:04:14.770> read<00:04:15.239> rebe<00:04:16.239> end<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:16.570> by<00:04:16.690> hand

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and then just read rebe end it by hand

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.910 
and then just read rebe end it by hand
on<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.739> former<00:04:18.510> nice<00:04:19.510> tight<00:04:19.959> bends<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.739> i

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
on the former nice tight bends that i

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.550 
on the former nice tight bends that i
had<00:04:21.040> already<00:04:21.160> made<00:04:21.459> with<00:04:21.640> my<00:04:21.820> vice<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:23.350> there

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
had already made with my vice and there

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.030 
had already made with my vice and there
it<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.760> on<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:25.930> what<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.170> sure<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.470> say<00:04:26.710> was

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
it is so on this what I sure to say was

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.600 
it is so on this what I sure to say was
I<00:04:28.200> wasn't<00:04:29.200> sure<00:04:29.410> how<00:04:29.680> much<00:04:29.740> space<00:04:30.160> i<00:04:30.370> was<00:04:30.460> going

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
I wasn't sure how much space i was going

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.450 
I wasn't sure how much space i was going
to<00:04:30.640> need<00:04:30.790> so<00:04:31.030> i<00:04:31.060> left<00:04:31.360> extra<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.919> now<00:04:32.950> that<00:04:33.430> i

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
to need so i left extra and now that i

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.200 
to need so i left extra and now that i
have<00:04:33.790> it

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
have it

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.890 
have it
hey<00:04:36.110> what<00:04:36.319> happens<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:38.210> best<00:04:38.419> way<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.660> be

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
hey what happens is the best way to be

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.820 
hey what happens is the best way to be
this<00:04:39.139> when<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.800> do<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.960> put<00:04:42.229> it<00:04:42.319> on<00:04:42.470> a

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
this when I do it is you put it on a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.059 
this when I do it is you put it on a
little<00:04:45.830> tricky<00:04:46.069> book<00:04:46.400> right<00:04:47.120> back<00:04:47.330> here

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
little tricky book right back here

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.960 
little tricky book right back here
anyway<00:04:49.069> like<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:52.130> get<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.430> on<00:04:52.520> those<00:04:52.729> two

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
anyway like that and get it on those two

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:01.059 
anyway like that and get it on those two
first<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:55.520> then<00:04:55.789> bring<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.180> over<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.770> put<00:05:00.949> it

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
first and then bring it over and put it

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:06.550 
first and then bring it over and put it
on<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.340> hair<00:05:01.550> like<00:05:01.759> that<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:05.780> way<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.500> you

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
on the hair like that that way and you

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.469 
on the hair like that that way and you
can<00:05:06.889> tighten<00:05:07.490> everything<00:05:07.580> down<00:05:07.849> straighten

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
can tighten everything down straighten

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.620 
can tighten everything down straighten
it<00:05:08.630> up<00:05:08.750> tighten<00:05:09.169> it<00:05:09.320> down<00:05:10.240> I'm<00:05:11.240> going<00:05:11.389> to<00:05:11.479> turn

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
it up tighten it down I'm going to turn

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.779 
it up tighten it down I'm going to turn
this<00:05:11.780> off<00:05:11.960> so<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:12.199> can<00:05:12.380> put<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:12.650> last<00:05:12.889> missing

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
this off so I can put that last missing

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.310 
this off so I can put that last missing
plate<00:05:14.090> on<00:05:14.330> there<00:05:14.539> I've<00:05:15.199> got<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:17.320> positive

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
plate on there I've got the positive

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.390 
plate on there I've got the positive
legs<00:05:18.860> pick<00:05:19.610> up<00:05:19.759> right<00:05:20.000> there<00:05:21.039> comes<00:05:22.039> down

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
legs pick up right there comes down

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.680 
legs pick up right there comes down
which<00:05:23.090> creates<00:05:23.509> a<00:05:23.599> nice<00:05:23.750> standoff<00:05:25.449> up<00:05:26.449> and

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
which creates a nice standoff up and

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.850 
which creates a nice standoff up and
over<00:05:26.930> into<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.680> one<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:29.419> shrink<00:05:30.289> tubing<00:05:30.650> is

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
over into that one the shrink tubing is

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.730 
over into that one the shrink tubing is
all<00:05:31.039> in<00:05:31.220> place<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:31.699> keep<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:33.130> currents<00:05:34.130> from

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
all in place to keep the currents from

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.040 
all in place to keep the currents from
causing<00:05:36.740> problems<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.550> cable<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.150> a

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
causing problems the cable and a

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.300 
causing problems the cable and a
connector<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:39.849> just<00:05:40.849> put<00:05:41.449> wire<00:05:41.720> there<00:05:42.310> and

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
connector and just put wire there and

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.740 
connector and just put wire there and
then<00:05:43.550> this<00:05:43.699> one<00:05:43.759> I'll<00:05:44.000> probably<00:05:44.180> just<00:05:44.389> bend

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
then this one I'll probably just bend

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.670 
then this one I'll probably just bend
over<00:05:44.870> and<00:05:45.110> cut<00:05:45.289> off<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:48.080> other<00:05:48.259> thing<00:05:48.349> I<00:05:48.620> do

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
over and cut off so the other thing I do

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.980 
over and cut off so the other thing I do
have<00:05:48.949> to<00:05:49.099> do<00:05:49.250> is<00:05:49.490> put<00:05:50.229> shrink<00:05:51.229> tubing<00:05:51.680> on<00:05:52.990> what

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
have to do is put shrink tubing on what

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.990 
have to do is put shrink tubing on what
extends<00:05:54.469> beyond<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.889> plates<00:05:55.280> here<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:55.880> that

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
extends beyond the plates here so that

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.779 
extends beyond the plates here so that
they<00:05:56.180> don't<00:05:56.440> get<00:05:57.440> cross<00:05:57.830> current<00:05:58.370> going<00:05:58.550> in

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
they don't get cross current going in

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.170 
they don't get cross current going in
between<00:05:58.940> here<00:05:59.560> with<00:06:00.560> shrink<00:06:00.889> tubing<00:06:01.219> I<00:06:01.460> tried

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
between here with shrink tubing I tried

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.029 
between here with shrink tubing I tried
electrical<00:06:02.570> tape<00:06:02.900> on<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.199> last<00:06:03.409> lap<00:06:03.650> and<00:06:03.889> it

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
electrical tape on the last lap and it

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.370 
electrical tape on the last lap and it
comes<00:06:04.340> right<00:06:04.490> off<00:06:04.699> so<00:06:05.330> shrink<00:06:05.960> tubing<00:06:06.259> is

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
comes right off so shrink tubing is

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.409 
comes right off so shrink tubing is
definitely<00:06:06.860> the<00:06:06.949> way<00:06:06.979> to<00:06:07.099> go<00:06:07.250> the<00:06:08.000> other<00:06:08.150> thing

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
definitely the way to go the other thing

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.480 
definitely the way to go the other thing
that<00:06:08.449> I<00:06:08.570> did<00:06:08.840> that<00:06:08.990> I<00:06:09.080> forgotten<00:06:09.740> to<00:06:09.830> do<00:06:10.009> and<00:06:10.370> I

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
that I did that I forgotten to do and I

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.810 
that I did that I forgotten to do and I
did<00:06:10.550> it<00:06:10.729> on<00:06:10.880> my<00:06:10.940> up<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:12.050> outside<00:06:12.320> of<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.610> two

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
did it on my up the outside of the two

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.779 
did it on my up the outside of the two
end<00:06:14.060> plates<00:06:14.360> I<00:06:14.810> do<00:06:14.900> go<00:06:15.650> ahead<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:15.979> etch<00:06:16.340> with

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
end plates I do go ahead and etch with

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.990 
end plates I do go ahead and etch with
the<00:06:17.030> stage<00:06:17.330> 6<00:06:17.659> grit<00:06:17.930> paper<00:06:18.729> because<00:06:19.729> of<00:06:19.940> the

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
the stage 6 grit paper because of the

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.360 
the stage 6 grit paper because of the
convection<00:06:20.389> currents<00:06:21.139> I<00:06:21.349> don't<00:06:22.099> want<00:06:22.250> any

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
convection currents I don't want any

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.770 
convection currents I don't want any
bubble<00:06:22.699> sticking<00:06:23.060> to<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.240> side<00:06:23.449> I<00:06:23.479> want

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
bubble sticking to the side I want

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.219 
bubble sticking to the side I want
everything<00:06:24.139> that<00:06:24.469> can<00:06:24.680> possibly<00:06:25.009> go<00:06:25.729> up<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:27.080> go

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
everything that can possibly go up to go

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.469 
everything that can possibly go up to go
up<00:06:27.440> and<00:06:27.650> out<00:06:27.770> so<00:06:28.430> I<00:06:28.460> did<00:06:28.849> go<00:06:29.030> ahead<00:06:29.120> and<00:06:29.240> etch

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
up and out so I did go ahead and etch

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.149 
up and out so I did go ahead and etch
those<00:06:29.780> two<00:06:30.050> before<00:06:30.409> I<00:06:30.440> bolted<00:06:30.680> everything

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
those two before I bolted everything

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.310 
those two before I bolted everything
together
