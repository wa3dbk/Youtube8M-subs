00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.759 
put only a quart worth of formula so
that<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.250> drives<00:00:28.670> like<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.689> glaze<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.589> has<00:00:30.740> a

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
that it drives like a glaze that has a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.790 
that it drives like a glaze that has a
clear<00:00:31.279> base<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:32.900> if<00:00:33.020> I<00:00:33.170> didn't<00:00:33.500> have<00:00:33.650> any

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
clear base so that if I didn't have any

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.530 
clear base so that if I didn't have any
10<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:34.370> wouldn't<00:00:34.670> even<00:00:34.730> see<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:35.090> on<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.330> wall

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
10 you wouldn't even see it on the wall

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.210 
10 you wouldn't even see it on the wall
really<00:00:35.750> but<00:00:36.050> with<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.320> tint<00:00:36.620> in<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:36.860> it

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
really but with the tint in it it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.860 
really but with the tint in it it
behaves<00:00:37.580> just<00:00:37.700> like<00:00:37.880> a<00:00:38.000> bowl<00:00:38.330> glaze

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
behaves just like a bowl glaze

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.710 
behaves just like a bowl glaze
and<00:00:38.960> I<00:00:39.110> put<00:00:39.380> a<00:00:39.410> lot<00:00:39.650> of<00:00:40.040> latex<00:00:40.850> extender<00:00:41.600> in

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
and I put a lot of latex extender in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.750 
and I put a lot of latex extender in
there<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.530> that<00:00:42.560> my<00:00:42.860> open<00:00:43.190> time<00:00:43.400> is<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.550> little

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
there so that my open time is a little

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.820 
there so that my open time is a little
bit<00:00:43.880> longer<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.300> need<00:00:44.570> time<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:44.810> work<00:00:45.170> that<00:00:45.440> and

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
bit longer I need time to work that and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.280 
bit longer I need time to work that and
the<00:00:45.980> exterior<00:00:46.430> paint<00:00:46.670> dries<00:00:46.940> really<00:00:47.240> fast<00:00:47.360> so

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
the exterior paint dries really fast so

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.860 
the exterior paint dries really fast so
I<00:00:48.590> both<00:00:48.800> put<00:00:49.130> water<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.730> a<00:00:50.270> lot<00:00:50.660> of<00:00:50.690> that

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
I both put water and a lot of that

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.960 
I both put water and a lot of that
extender<00:00:51.410> in<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.680> you'll<00:00:52.280> find<00:00:52.520> that<00:00:52.610> there<00:00:52.820> is

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
extender in it you'll find that there is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.940 
extender in it you'll find that there is
a<00:00:53.000> lot<00:00:53.270> of<00:00:53.300> difference<00:00:53.750> in<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.960> way<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.680> taco

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950

handles depending on the sheen of the
base<00:00:57.620> coat<00:00:57.950> if<00:00:58.220> I<00:00:58.370> use<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.670> flat<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.570> would

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
base coat if I use the flat it would

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.750 
base coat if I use the flat it would
stick<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.350> absorb<00:01:00.710> into<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.070> surface<00:01:01.610> if

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
stick and absorb into the surface if

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.030 
stick and absorb into the surface if
it's<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.030> semi-gloss<00:01:02.450> it<00:01:02.750> was<00:01:02.840> too<00:01:03.020> shiny<00:01:03.320> then
