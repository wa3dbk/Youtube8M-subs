22 teams and I got picked 24th or

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.500 
22 teams and I got picked 24th or
actually<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.910> might<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.090> been<00:01:03.149> less<00:01:03.300> than

that Washington now I should have won

that Washington now I should have won
pick<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> believe<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> Raiders<00:01:07.890> had<00:01:08.070> two

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
pick but I believe the Raiders had two

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.969 
pick but I believe the Raiders had two
picks<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> first<00:01:09.140> 24<00:01:10.140> NiO<00:01:10.380> say<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
picks in the first 24 NiO say I want to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.440 
picks in the first 24 NiO say I want to
prove<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> other<00:01:11.369> teams<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> passed<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.299> me

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
prove the other teams that passed on me

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.750 
prove the other teams that passed on me
that<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:12.750> made<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> mistake<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.890> look<00:01:14.670> at

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that they made a mistake and I look at

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570 
that they made a mistake and I look at
