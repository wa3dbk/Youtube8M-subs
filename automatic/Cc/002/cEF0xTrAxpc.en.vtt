00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
 that is free for the constant vanden stock stadium and when i come here 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.690
 in the neighborhood you are prepared with dogs 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.990
 If you are on a Saturday afternoon around five o'clock it's a great impression about one 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.029
 home game of stvv 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.609
 but that is not the case now 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.150
 doing the yellow blue light is getting ready to conquer pump Anderlecht 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.459
 almost fifteen hundred enthusiastic supporters take a place in the 28 

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:25.210
 bussum 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.010
 on the other side of the street the player bus is ready to leave 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.120
 at half past five the time has come for the column of 28 between 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.360
 that is a move towards Anderlecht 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.729
 so motorized policemen guide the convoy and take care of it 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.729
 that it should not stop at any intersection 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.720
 so site ambiance is probably good at it 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.000
 more than sixty kilometers are covered almost completely 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.860
 everyone here has the same opinion that the canaries must this season 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.110
 to win on only one match that on Anderlecht it's kind of like 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.790
 Jan de Kerpel has been good 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.239
 in between 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.460
 the train supporters but it is actually a good film and anderlecht 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.070
 because of the lesson and the capitals and saints becomes a bit too 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.950
 nonsense ans the brothers of Limburg and I think in the field of football nobody knows 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.680
 of wales and hopefully today with theo lucius victory 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.150
 to fall there 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.460
 scare you 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 in I expect one 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 one at the battle why this became true with norway and with the other supporters 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 have it yourself carry the previous one 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.870
 an ep 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.660
 also boris milan 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.240
 the loan 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.770
 the big role 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.940
 the bus driver himself remains very calm 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.460
 meanwhile they have almost arrived in constant vanden 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.830
 stock stadium 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.170
 games from the bus boiling stvv supporters immediately enter their territory 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.910
 off 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.870
 vandenbussche klaas van kruistum is massively moving towards the stadium 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.140
 there is back to work before an hour can be taken on the spot 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.999
 devon for behind the scenes the 22 actors on the field 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.969
 the stadium is packed with 25,000 spectators 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.949
 more than 5,000 of them from Sint Truiden and its surroundings 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.450
 in the fifth minute, Anderlecht get a first warning a free kick 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.689
 van belinda mans march can be decisive shoots up close incomprehensible 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.859
 or piss off 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.319
 from then on the national champion presses his back against the empty goal 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.709
 visitors get away well a few times 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.110
 but recently also one first plays the game of his life that is already now 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.269
 clearly 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.319
 nevertheless, the stvv supporters are not disturbed by it 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 Brussels offensive 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.209
 ten minutes before the break 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.639
 the sweaters follow the roof because they are new to wood 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.639
 completely embarrassed 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.129
 to the rest consonant therefore Martin name 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.579
 this seems to me 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.139
 to emmen 9 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.989
 the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.519
 in the second half it is mainly seen in the countdown for the prices of it 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.180
 blown 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.789
 from the first second 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.789
 Anderlecht does have the hustle and bustle but is never really dangerous 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:44.709
 within five minutes of time, the window only stopped 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.720
 and the sweaters party can begin 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.720
 fortunately it is no longer true for the supporters 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.689
 and the players are also crazy for most of them it was 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.169
 the first time she played at Anderlecht 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.929
 stvv chairman knapen of course has nothing but praise for the most loyal following 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.409
 it possibility more direction 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.409
 it eventually became the German magazine people 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.549
 was previously the company is the supporters period last year 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.289
 the real reason 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.989
 become a habit of action plan 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.700
 exercise and behave 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.700
 there he is again that is the second time that I am fit 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.550
 selling the return trip has also started 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 but the alliance later a bit against 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.189
 wilders wild hikers 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.110
 according to the spokeswoman 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.110
 for stars if a little this 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.110
 so we stood was more a longer period 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.310
 just experienced in the running for European football but in times 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.449
 also the other Limburg top-class lommel 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.610
 in a following season 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.029
 the dancers 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.509
 Rotterdam on the program in the Rag Basket Band Fred Play 29 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:18.999
