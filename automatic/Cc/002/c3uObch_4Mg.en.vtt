00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.850
 Last summer we were strong faith, 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.850
 Before you showed us all where our place is. 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.220
 Your sunsets failed for another day, 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.220
 But in my opinion, you've caught them too much. 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 Let us see how it sinks, 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
 Let the water flood his lungs 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.190
 Filled with the scent of broken hearts. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.460
 Each of them would give their lives once 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.650
 for a bit of your love, 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.650
 But today, each of them is praying for your last breath. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.800
 If we have to meet you sometime, 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.580
 Let it be in hell at least. 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.430
 There's more than one knife in our backs, 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.130
 And yet you squeeze more of them in your hands. 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.690
 I heard that the roofs turned into domes 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 For those who missed the last train home. 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.140
 And yes, you rolled your whole arsenal, 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 However, only against those who are defenseless. 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 Let me fall apart, 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 That I could be built from the beginning. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 For those broken wings that I used to stick to, 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.610
 They are no longer able to lift me to heaven. 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.690
 This bird will never fly into the air, 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.380
 Among the vultures listening to his whine. 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.230
 He was blessed with broken wings, 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 Before he could leave his nest. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.670
 A piece of life that you have torn from me 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.420
 He miraculously missed my veins. 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.420
 I fell into a smile lined with falsehood, 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.910
 To survive, I had to learn to pretend it. 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.640
 A piece of life that you have torn from me, 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.500
 He miraculously missed my veins. 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.230
 I fell into a smile lined with falsehood, 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.630
 To survive, I had to learn to pretend it.
