00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 what are the people of youtube 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.340
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.690
 put 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.960
 music in your car without any of 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.620
 these devices can be seen 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.869
 this 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.240
 for example, I'm going to need 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.940
 put a kind of these devices good at 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.640
 beginning was this 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.390
 because the area where the car parked 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.360
 this does not circulate many people or until 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.180
 almost alone the street 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.490
 then I was forced to put a guy 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.690
 of these devices because I liked it 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.760
 a lot of hearing music 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.170
 in the course of the road and all that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.640
 kind of easy 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.550
 with this is sought as an amplifier 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.250
 md moto that here says it is 900 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.010
 watts I do not believe the truth that it is 900 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.080
 watts then make a car puts you 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 an amplifier of 500 webs to put 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.910
 buffer and put several things in this and 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.960
 sounds very good but to others for the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:04.339
 logically it is not 900 white 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.290
 It's good because I have to buy a 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.810
 adapter cited like these 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.080
 this to be able to connect it in the part 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.700
 behind 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.740
 I already have the speakers connected 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.480
 that's why he says positive inside the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 negative force 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.520
 and buy a reserved 3.5 cable as 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.429
 who is good sir 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.609
 like this if it is connected to the 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.609
 device and this one to some mp3 cell phone 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.580
 I'll show you how it works 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.670
 and the quality of the sound that has trick 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.590
 connect with white red with white 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.230
 well I was here I do not have a 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.340
 battery as well as using this device 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.550
 yes because it gives me the voltage of a 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.550
 drums 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.079
 it's costing around 300 pesos 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:11.700
 something more a little more complete if three 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.680
 entries for the sd and usb apart from that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.450
 brings an integrated fm radio 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.330
 if it's around recently I just 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.190
 see is in 503 this 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.350
 to raise a bit of compression price 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.180
 from when I bought it equally follows 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.610
 being a little cheaper than buying a 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.630
 stadium and the great advantage that can be 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.700
 save you can hide then yes 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.500
 and that already comes with an integrated control 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.970
 that I teach you right now 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.940
 good 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.520
 I already have this connected and everything is 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.520
 connected or see the voltage 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.760
 sir what is this 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.979
 Right 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.979
 [Music] 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.780
 the cable is now 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.930
 Are you connected 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.850
 [Music] 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.610
 here it is 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.160
 here it's on if I do not have the maximum 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.540
 volume 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.840
 to the maximum this for further handling and then 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.310
 put a maximum volume of you 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.550
 You can download from your cell phone 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.550
 let's connect 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.710
 this 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.800
 [Music] 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.840
 here we can control the volume but 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.960
 how the device will be hidden 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.610
 then how I recommended them is better 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.890
 to control the volume from the cell phone 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.720
 yes to not be 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.810
 given in my case for example I put it 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.390
 down the glove compartment on the side of the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.980
 co-pilot then I will not be 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.950
 throwing to be going down and up 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.140
 low volume nor any minor citizen 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.000
 but in the part where the 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.280
 outside there is like a little box then 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.800
 there you can get well without problems if 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.419
 As it is hollow, it can be put like that without 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.680
 problems or where the hand brake goes 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.790
 I do not know you can engineer them 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.380
 propose the cell phone 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.340
 comfortably 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.650
 [Music] 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.580
 this brings what is 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.570
 [Music] 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.870
 but if the very serious 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.870
 [Music] 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.590
 very well 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.089
 the speakers all bet on the parma 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:04.059
 they cost 50 for the investment already net that 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:08.300
 you are going to invest is around 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:12.070
 who like 150 if they buy the device 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.960
 in which the one that is more complete 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.960
 is in the radio module 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.000
 you can change stations to 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.000
 early movies 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.879
 and they bring the opportunity 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.449
 the sd and youtube cards we are going to 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.449
 connect a 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.520
 It changes a lot in the quality of the sound 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.670
 and good 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.610
 [Music] 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.230
 you can control the sound the volume 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.230
 through control 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.920
 this also brings the functionality of 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.400
 connect the cell phone comment this 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.270
 subscribe if you have any questions ask 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.660
 he 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.660
 Thank you
