00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:42.490
 now activate the yeast well 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 we mix we put in a warm place on 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.430
 5-10 minutes until our yeast is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 come to life 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 we will prepare the following take two eggs 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.980

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:34.600
 I will knead the dough on milk 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:38.520
 You can also take water and the main thing to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.520
 water or milk was warm 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.630
 now we take flour and sifting 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.030
 sift and about 300 grams not 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.940
 all at once, I recommend sifting flour 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.940
 before each kneading any dough so 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.160
 how flour is saturated with oxygen and dough 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.380
 will be more magnificent yes and still I poured 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.539
 half a liter of warm milk before 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:14.410
 sifting flour now take yeast 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.980

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.640
 it is advisable to pour them out on flour 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.640

 should be soft put the dough on the table 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:17.890
