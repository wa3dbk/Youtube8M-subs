00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 and so these colors are not used 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 it is necessary so the thing you through to eyebrows 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.800
 and eyelashes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.650
 this paint for eyebrows and eyelashes black 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.650
 color these paints were bought in Ukraine and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.269
 price m2 order up to 23 25 g n is 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.699
 Estel professional is called 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:36.590
 it is missing from painting but very much 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.590
 that is, I will show one here and so here 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.059
 measure the air mix here so here 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.850
 paint and I squeeze literally one by one 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.890
 two droplets and it mixes yes how 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.739
 ordinary hair dye and as for two 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.199
 tube to the best emulsion 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.449
 such a stick to stir and sat down and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.899
 the process itself is just mixing paint 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.220
 mercy and black and red before 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 enjoyed black red yet 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.210
 I tried brownish enough 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.729
 fair girl and for me brown 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 more fit to my hair and black 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.700
 paint i use only to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.380
 paint the eyelashes because the eyelashes have 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 me too red and woke up in the morning 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 to be more or less clear that I later 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.430
 painted and also ink but nonetheless I 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.130
 torture exhibited 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.870
 ha his face we will start today now 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.900
 let's start with eyebrows and she tells me 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.550
 of goods it seemed that if the salon paints 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.170
 then first they start to sculpt and 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.010
 overshadow was already a salon and I 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.100
 stopped going to paint 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.590
 there was a little wrong then not the result 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.810
 which I expected was a very awful one 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.250
 once I painted the house on the site 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.970
 peroxide so rubbed those eyebrows I her 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.970
 I press quite such a kapelyushechku 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.280
 I squeezed out so much now 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:10.720
 here is an emulsion 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:13.720
 and her, too, somewhere so a couple of droplets so 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.010
 not to be approximately the same 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.310
 the amount of stir stick we 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.720
 Stir and apply the same stick 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 paint on the eyebrow principle can be eyelashes 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.769
 paint and other method more dangerous. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.690
 as ordinary and eyelash brush 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.670
 from the ink about the fact that the paint a little bit 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.700
 it's all the same paint there is it under 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.440
 the eyes will stove hurt a little so in 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.880
 This size make up a number of eyelashes as 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.070
 it's done in solo to everyone from she 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.750
 stirred it became homogeneous it is 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.700
 white but over time it will manifest 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.030
 will turn brown I start them immediately 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.030
 to put 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.940
 man when I have skin well 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.280
 and of course we try only new but 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.500
 Manure is not applied to the skin too much can 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.870
 remove ordinary chopsticks from ear to ear 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.660
 brown paint i'm not afraid to paint 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.709
 eyebrows can not overdo it yes in principle 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.110
 how can you but not be so scary 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.550
 does it look there if black made up 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.740
 eyebrows you enough week two weeks 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.990
 when you donâ€™t need a pencil 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.780
 correct but tinted eyebrows inflicted 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.790
 and wait depending on the intensity 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.170
 you want to buy, you can imagine 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.200
 wait 2 minutes five minutes seven minutes 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.260
 and never between the flush I wash off so 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.450
 ordinary cotton swab disc in 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.580
 Basically, I do it in the bathroom and look 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.590
 There is on intensity in principle eyebrows 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.720
 have become a little bit darker and the coloring is not 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.630
 threw out until already a hundred 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.580
 percent did not make yourself eyebrows and if 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.430
 I want even a little bit darker we 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:05.590
 we can apply it for a short while 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:09.209
 here is the result brooks on interfere black 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.209
 color but try with chopsticks 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.650
 very deep whether park 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.350
 if the skin gets nothing scary but 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.250
 then wash the salt shaker again just 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.330
 take 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:32.040
 cream on a dedicated basis or just me 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.530
 I do not know the cream and smears a century before 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.520
 puts paint to make it easier then paint 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.520
 with cute skin 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.010
 I paint as usual lashes more beautiful 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.110
 not only i keep a little little time 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.560
 because so that the paint does not hit me in 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.080
 eyes and not some kind of stained 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.990
 cool that on a cotton pad, too paint 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.850
 remains very appreciated yes yes it is 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.980
 the nuances of which should pay attention 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.140
 men should not be near them 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.030
 not afraid and ran away from you I 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.130
 I think that all the beauty of which she will 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.850
 a woman should direct herself 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.260
 Photo husband home or muffins and still such 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.700
 nuance if still hit the paint 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.100
 the challenge starts and eyes 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.700
 you should definitely go straight to the small 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.380
 removed, see or already for paint no effect 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.020
 Of course, when you dye your eyelashes 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.760
 mascara but nevertheless they became darker 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.070
 more noticeable, that is, more noticeable, yes, that is, you 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.070
 took your face that's all the work 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.890
 this is some kind is not written anywhere that 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.540
 black written black mur found 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.470
 why spoil the video and about 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:18.899
 little girls do not understand this until 5 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.899
