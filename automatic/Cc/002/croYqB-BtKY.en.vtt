00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 for day welcome to a new 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.230
 episode pedro the tinker today 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.730
 we will see how they repair 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 your vacuum and multiply the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.850
 length of life of your bag 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.900
 we never have the reference we do not find 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.119
 these plays at certain prices anyway 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.199
 so we will multiply in total or for 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.529
 use five times your minimum bag 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 which we are all going to look at already 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.739
 looked at most vacuum cleaners with 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.380
 use happens to this sad guy 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.690
 like what the pipe is cutting 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 so of course we can repair them 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.420
 many put scotch scotch wants 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 and not waterproof that does not fit in the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.399
 duration in time 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.680
 I will show you how very 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.489
 easily we will fix it then you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.320
 continue with a good cutter you cut 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.670
 if there is resistance 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.430
 so that's not flora a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.170
 quality a messiah and good 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.190
 resistance 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.449
 we come there is a flow of business 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.890
 the north what we will see more 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.049
 far 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.130
 brilliant with most of these 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.350
 devices are so it's enough are on 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.610
 screw threads so you just have to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.439
 unscrewed just look are you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.950
 screw up your hose repair and there I 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.259
 can you tell that it's gone for a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.960
 good suction shot a time is going the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 see on two of the super material 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.369
 you will see the next you hesitate 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.380
 not a few centimeters it is removed 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.970
 not embarrass and frankly try to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.860
 find the ass or the right diameter of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.329
 good fixation 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.350
 you will never find and your coach 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.930
 even with fabric 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 if repairs to odds and ends that do not 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.009
 do not hold on long enough huh it's 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.720
 not the bonnie so you really 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.090
 a good repair 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 there another then that's it you see 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.210
 this already high-end equipment and we 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.670
 finds himself then see the system is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.619
 made to turn so you have two 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.810
 small spurs that allows you to 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.280
 kindly disassemble it 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.950
 doc and toc if you want to see that those 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.480
 boxes very easily because the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.660
 look at the pipe why are we going to finish 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.069
 to let go handle the part that is broken 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.660
 and there we meet that I meant 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.019
 a wire that is in and which 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.709
 allows the solidity so it flows to the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.680
 cutting pliers 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.030
 so here we would not dare this part 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.959
 so she can be slightly parcel 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:44.510
 So watch is put there to turn the vice 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:46.790
 and we do not hesitate there once too 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.410
 cut I put glue and I live 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.840
 look here we have their lives here and 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.970
 when it is blocked you can 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.849
 put back on saab at general in 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.890
 respecting the code desire taste here I 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.830
 now you have only the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.680
 ranks beauty your pipe -3 couple 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:12.769
 centimeters but who leaves for a 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:16.180
 new life I take a blade of 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.340
 razor being careful I pass 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.030
 well I'm doing a little episiotomy 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.030
 here and now I open the bag 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.720
 here we are 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.920
 the bag is completely empty and I'm doing 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.660
 look at a net of glue that makes 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.580
 well it's still good and good but 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.460
 glue that is not glue gun is going 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.460
 very well I take a rule to make 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.590
 my little perfect college gelard turns 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.730
 on himself 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:56.530
 look at you press on both sides 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:05.740
 I have pressed the increasingly insecure 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:05.740
 nothing is worth it is good at graf 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.830
 in addition to the glue that will make play 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.970
 we look 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.060
 they are well back this is your 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.130
 bag and ecologically reusable and 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.140
 at the price of the bag we can do as there is 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.330
 several sides we can open it to 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.900
 several places at least four times 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.920
 you can save your bag sas and 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.540
 of ecology and that's my bag is 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.440
 completely that seems so I can 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.060
 their mother in use in her 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.190
 very specific location because 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.070
 cartons bag shapes all that stuff 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.830
 it's very complicated so much so 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.320
 here he can leave for the month 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.510
 four lives 1 there are four sides a bag 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.100
 the situation and the enjoin that is 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.950
 always very interesting to keep 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.400
 so do not hesitate sure lets 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.070
 prolong saving and then that makes 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.180
 it's a pretty ecological concept is 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.470
 we close and it's simple 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.780
 because finding the model of 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.400
 references these few canvases course 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.890
 of the fighter 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.420
 a fee for 3 or 4 5, in 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.120
 a work beast cardboard box i 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.140
 recognize but then must adapt when 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.610
 same question of a viewer I 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.950
 more global prison cuts 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.390
 there is only one little bit left 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.620
 because frankly you lengthen the 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.510
 life of your pipe you 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.610
 find another in the trash because 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.260
 people read fucking ferrets it does not 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.000
 not walk so we regret you 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.750
 recycle completely you recover 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.850
 pipes cut reasonably some 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.150
 centimeters did not want at all happy 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.729
 from them drop you will not have any more good 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.520
 now you know how 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.360
 repair your pipes how to extend the 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.660
 life of your bags 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.560
 it's very ecological and now I 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.639
 wish you a good life 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.770
 respirator 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.440
 ok see you soon and in addition you have 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.000
 a good pipe to be able to play 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.340
 trifecta 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.180
 see you soon in another episode of 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.180
