features<00:03:21.800> basically<00:03:22.800> on<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> fresh<00:03:23.340> system<00:03:23.670> you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
features basically on a fresh system you

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.910 
features basically on a fresh system you
could<00:03:23.880> do<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> calibration<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.620> where<00:03:25.800> we

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
could do a calibration this is where we

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.250 
could do a calibration this is where we
would<00:03:26.010> also<00:03:26.190> save<00:03:26.580> new<00:03:26.790> heights<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.360> can

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
would also save new heights and you can

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.950 
would also save new heights and you can
change<00:03:28.500> your<00:03:28.620> settings<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.100> preferences<00:03:29.310> so

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
change your settings and preferences so

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.270 
change your settings and preferences so
real<00:03:30.960> quick<00:03:31.140> I'll<00:03:31.290> kind<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.500> show<00:03:31.710> you<00:03:31.770> if<00:03:31.950> you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
real quick I'll kind of show you if you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.220 
real quick I'll kind of show you if you
had<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> fresh<00:03:32.670> system<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> brand<00:03:33.480> new<00:03:33.630> one<00:03:33.780> you

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
had a fresh system a brand new one you

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
had a fresh system a brand new one you
would<00:03:34.350> go<00:03:34.560> into<00:03:34.680> calibration<00:03:35.370> choose<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
would go into calibration choose the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.700 
would go into calibration choose the
type<00:03:36.210> of<00:03:36.360> calibration<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.900> wanted<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.260> do<00:03:37.440> and

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
type of calibration you wanted to do and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.060 
type of calibration you wanted to do and
step<00:03:38.400> through<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.820> procedure<00:03:39.060> step<00:03:39.630> by<00:03:39.780> step

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
step through this procedure step by step

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.350 
step through this procedure step by step
so<00:03:41.070> let's<00:03:41.430> say<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:41.610> wanted<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.910> save<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> new

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
so let's say you wanted to save a new

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.020 
so let's say you wanted to save a new
height<00:03:42.570> we'll<00:03:43.530> jump<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.950> save<00:03:43.980> Heights<00:03:44.670> and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
height we'll jump in to save Heights and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.970 
height we'll jump in to save Heights and
this<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:45.990> where<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.260> would<00:03:46.320> use<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.650> manual

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this is where you would use the manual

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.520 
this is where you would use the manual
adjustment<00:03:47.459> arrows<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:48.510> manually<00:03:49.140> move<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
adjustment arrows to manually move the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.160 
adjustment arrows to manually move the
car<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.240> new<00:03:51.390> height<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:51.690> want<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.959> save

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
car to a new height you want to save

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.680 
car to a new height you want to save
from<00:03:52.860> here<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.160> click<00:03:53.340> Next<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.030> then<00:03:54.090> we

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
from here you click Next and then we

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.090 
from here you click Next and then we
choose<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.930> position<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.590> we<00:03:55.650> want<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:55.890> save

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
choose the position that we want to save

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.670 
choose the position that we want to save
to<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.120> we<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.780> height<00:03:57.959> as<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.200> low<00:03:58.440> crew

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to so we like this height as a low crew

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.440 
to so we like this height as a low crew
size<00:03:58.920> we're<00:03:59.580> going<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.760> hold<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.030> number<00:04:00.270> one

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
size we're going to hold the number one

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.990 
size we're going to hold the number one
button<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.920> says<00:04:02.100> boom<00:04:02.340> position<00:04:02.850> one

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
button and it says boom position one

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000 
button and it says boom position one
save<00:04:03.270> it<00:04:03.810> shows<00:04:03.990> up<00:04:04.170> on<00:04:04.260> your<00:04:04.410> touchpad<00:04:04.620> that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
save it shows up on your touchpad that

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.920 
save it shows up on your touchpad that
now<00:04:05.160> we're<00:04:05.670> at<00:04:05.820> position<00:04:06.270> one<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.690> saved

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
now we're at position one and it's saved

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.050 
now we're at position one and it's saved

so<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.520> just<00:04:26.729> wanted<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.030> show<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.300> quick

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
so I just wanted to show you a quick

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.030 
so I just wanted to show you a quick
example<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.080> some<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.410> diagnostic

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
example of some of the diagnostic

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.880 
example of some of the diagnostic
features<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.760> eye<00:04:29.790> level<00:04:30.030> system<00:04:30.450> has<00:04:30.630> I

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
features that the eye level system has I

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.230 
features that the eye level system has I
went<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:31.980> disconnected<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.640> height<00:04:32.790> sensors

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
went and disconnected the height sensors

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.480 
went and disconnected the height sensors
from<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.870> ECU<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.010> can<00:04:35.130> see<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.460> your

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
what's happening with your system and so

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.810 
what's happening with your system and so
you<00:04:46.530> can<00:04:46.650> actually<00:04:46.920> jump<00:04:47.160> through<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.550> and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
you can actually jump through this and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.700 
you can actually jump through this and
it<00:04:47.880> will<00:04:48.000> give<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.210> hints<00:04:48.840> for<00:04:49.110> how<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.410> solve
