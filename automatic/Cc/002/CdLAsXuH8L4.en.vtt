got a new bright remote-control car from
Walmart<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.929> about<00:00:16.080> ten<00:00:16.289> dollars<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.789> an

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
Walmart for about ten dollars I have an

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.000 
Walmart for about ten dollars I have an
Arduino<00:00:18.270> Uno<00:00:18.480> running<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> back<00:00:19.680> here

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
Arduino Uno running in the back here

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.340 
Arduino Uno running in the back here
along<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> ping<00:00:21.270> sensor<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:22.050> kind<00:00:22.260> of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
along with the ping sensor that kind of

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.099 
along with the ping sensor that kind of
does<00:00:22.500> some<00:00:22.650> wall<00:00:22.859> deflection<00:00:23.750> now<00:00:24.750> keep<00:00:24.960> in

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
does some wall deflection now keep in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109 
does some wall deflection now keep in
mind<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> ten<00:00:25.920> dollar<00:00:26.039> RC<00:00:26.519> car<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.029> it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
mind this is a ten dollar RC car so it

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.480 
mind this is a ten dollar RC car so it
doesn't<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.480> greatest<00:00:27.660> steering<00:00:28.490> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
doesn't have the greatest steering the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.160 
doesn't have the greatest steering the
other<00:00:29.640> problem<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.090> had<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.359> initially<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.960> it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
other problem I had with initially is it

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.780 
other problem I had with initially is it
was<00:00:31.289> running<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.890> triple-a<00:00:32.309> batteries

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
was running on to triple-a batteries

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
was running on to triple-a batteries
just<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.870> wasn't<00:00:34.170> fast<00:00:34.410> enough<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.829> guess<00:00:35.010> for

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
just just wasn't fast enough I guess for

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.630 
just just wasn't fast enough I guess for
fun<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> Sunday<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.290> I've<00:00:37.290> done<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.710> where

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
fun on a Sunday so I've done is where

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.160 
fun on a Sunday so I've done is where
the<00:00:38.760> batteries<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.480> been<00:00:39.660> I've<00:00:39.899> since

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the batteries would have been I've since

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.049 
the batteries would have been I've since
taped<00:00:40.469> over<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> put<00:00:41.340> some<00:00:41.489> weight<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> there

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
taped over and put some weight in there

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.540 
taped over and put some weight in there
and<00:00:42.270> I've<00:00:42.480> added<00:00:43.170> two<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:44.520> three

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and I've added two one two three

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
and I've added two one two three
batteries<00:00:45.360> which<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> three<00:00:46.620> volt

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
batteries which is actually a three volt

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.090 
batteries which is actually a three volt
battery<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.450> that's<00:00:48.570> done<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.230> it's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
battery so what that's done is it's it's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.560 
battery so what that's done is it's it's
bumped<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.670> Johnny<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.300> three

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
bumped little Johnny here from three

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.500 
bumped little Johnny here from three
volts<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> six<00:00:52.820> so<00:00:53.820> I'd<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.360> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
volts up to six so I'd like to do is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.060 
volts up to six so I'd like to do is
demonstrate<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.500> Johnny<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.949> do

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
demonstrate what little Johnny can do

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.729 
demonstrate what little Johnny can do
and<00:00:56.660> we'll<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> keep<00:00:58.410> him<00:00:58.590> from

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and we'll see if we can keep him from

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
and we'll see if we can keep him from
totally<00:00:59.129> breaking<00:00:59.399> himself<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.239> he<00:01:00.449> cruises

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
totally breaking himself as he cruises

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.770 
totally breaking himself as he cruises
across<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.350> floor<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> flip<00:01:03.510> him<00:01:03.629> over

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
across my floor here so flip him over

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
across my floor here so flip him over
and<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.350> screwdriver<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> turn<00:01:05.129> them<00:01:05.280> on

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and go up my screwdriver to turn them on

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.969 
and go up my screwdriver to turn them on
because<00:01:05.790> well<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:07.350> can't<00:01:07.530> reach<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.860> there

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
because well I just can't reach in there

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:17.480 
because well I just can't reach in there
with<00:01:08.070> anything<00:01:08.340> else<00:01:15.140> from<00:01:16.140> flipping<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.250> on

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
with anything else from flipping over on

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.810 
with anything else from flipping over on
first<00:01:17.759> take<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.490> backing

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
first take off and do a little backing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:39.240 
first take off and do a little backing
off<00:01:24.119> try<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.810> off<00:01:24.900> somewhere

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.710 

any<00:01:39.790> funnel<00:01:40.600> isms<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.940> this<00:01:42.940> is<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.240> problem

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
any funnel isms and this is the problem

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.580 
any funnel isms and this is the problem
we<00:01:44.380> do<00:01:47.580> that<00:01:48.580> mine<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:50.110> might<00:01:50.260> just<00:01:50.380> have<00:01:50.530> a
