problem<00:01:06.250> here<00:01:06.580> in<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.790> snare<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.270> times<00:01:07.510> are

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
problem here in the snare the times are

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.960 
problem here in the snare the times are
the<00:01:07.780> symbols<00:01:08.170> but<00:01:08.320> because<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.830> kick<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.340> low

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
the symbols but because the kick is low

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.830 
the symbols but because the kick is low
it<00:01:10.510> rejects<00:01:11.200> forward<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:12.480> lot<00:01:13.480> of<00:01:13.570> times<00:01:13.750> I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
it rejects forward a lot of times I

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.270 
it rejects forward a lot of times I
couldn't<00:01:14.020> even<00:01:14.200> hear<00:01:14.410> what<00:01:14.740> my<00:01:14.890> feet<00:01:15.100> were

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
couldn't even hear what my feet were

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.810 
couldn't even hear what my feet were
doing<00:01:15.580> right<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.330> if<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.960> sent<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:18.280> know<00:01:18.370> send

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
doing right so if I sent you know send

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.330 
doing right so if I sent you know send
the<00:01:19.120> kick<00:01:19.360> channel<00:01:19.960> back<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.620> this<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:20.860> can<00:01:21.040> feel

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
the kick channel back to this I can feel

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.750 
the kick channel back to this I can feel
it<00:01:21.550> right<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.560> works<00:01:23.980> for<00:01:24.070> using<00:01:24.580> more

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
it right so it works for using more

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.000 
it right so it works for using more
electric<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:25.900> came<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.870> kit<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:29.800> a
