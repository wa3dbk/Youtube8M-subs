is simple just fill up the syringe and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.059 
is simple just fill up the syringe and
then<00:02:29.190> pump<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.180> oil<00:02:30.209> into<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.079> gearbox

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
then pump the oil into the gearbox

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:43.330 
then pump the oil into the gearbox
through<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.150> filler<00:02:33.360> pipe

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.600 

you<00:02:44.340> see<00:02:44.549> when<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.329> try<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.630> fill<00:02:46.230> up<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:47.310> oil

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
you see when you try to fill up with oil

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.490 
you see when you try to fill up with oil
and<00:02:47.940> oil<00:02:48.890> leaks<00:02:50.120> continuously<00:02:51.290> that's<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and oil leaks continuously that's the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.650 
and oil leaks continuously that's the
signal<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:55.470> gearbox<00:02:55.829> is<00:02:56.010> full<00:02:56.359> and<00:02:57.359> you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
signal that the gearbox is full and you

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.770 
signal that the gearbox is full and you
are<00:02:57.810> ready<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.139> close<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.920> filler<00:02:59.519> plug<00:03:02.780> you

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
are ready to close the filler plug you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.319 
are ready to close the filler plug you
don't<00:03:04.049> need<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.440> tighten<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:05.040> very<00:03:05.340> very

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
don't need to tighten this very very

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.539 
don't need to tighten this very very
tight<00:03:08.930> because<00:03:09.930> he<00:03:10.049> says<00:03:10.290> ring<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.069> crushes

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
tight because he says ring that crushes

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:37.450 
tight because he says ring that crushes
and<00:03:13.819> is<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.120> sealing<00:03:15.810> element<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.380> this

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.760 

you

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.330 

so<00:03:42.770> now<00:03:43.670> my<00:03:44.660> considerations<00:03:45.410> about<00:03:45.650> choosing

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
so now my considerations about choosing

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.490 
so now my considerations about choosing
the<00:03:46.489> right<00:03:46.670> file<00:03:47.180> if<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.810> want<00:03:48.020> to<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.319> can

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
the right file if you want to you can

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.160 
the right file if you want to you can
just<00:03:48.709> pause<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.550> video<00:03:49.849> or<00:03:50.030> else<00:03:50.599> if<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.110> are

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
just pause the video or else if you are

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.170 
just pause the video or else if you are
interested<00:03:51.709> in<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:51.980> topic<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.910> may

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
interested in this topic you may

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.949 
interested in this topic you may
continue<00:03:53.870> watching<00:03:54.800> so<00:03:55.730> there<00:03:56.630> are<00:03:56.750> three

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
continue watching so there are three

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.420 
continue watching so there are three
aspects<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.590> have<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.099> take<00:03:58.280> into

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
aspects that you have to take into

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.400 
aspects that you have to take into
account<00:03:58.519> when<00:03:59.000> selecting<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.630> right<00:03:59.810> oil<00:04:00.050> for

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410

the three aspects the third aspect is
the<00:04:44.180> grading<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.440> really<00:04:46.250> tricky<00:04:47.260> grading

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
the grading it's a really tricky grading

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.409 
the grading it's a really tricky grading
here<00:04:48.500> because<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:49.220> does<00:04:49.400> not<00:04:49.580> relate<00:04:50.150> with

here because it does not relate with

GL 5 oils for example these oils are
designed<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.820> withstand<00:05:17.030> much<00:05:17.539> higher

pressures and will be better in

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.750 
pressures and will be better in
principle<00:05:21.680> will<00:05:21.919> be<00:05:22.010> better<00:05:22.160> for<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.550> gearbox

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
principle will be better for the gearbox

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.560 
principle will be better for the gearbox
the<00:05:23.539> issue<00:05:23.690> is<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.010> Geo<00:05:25.010> files<00:05:25.310> oils<00:05:26.300> will

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
the issue is that Geo files oils will

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.480 
the issue is that Geo files oils will
have<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.750> higher<00:05:27.020> concentration<00:05:27.200> of<00:05:27.800> additives

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
have a higher concentration of additives
