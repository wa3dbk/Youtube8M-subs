not really pointy or shop or anyway and

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.530 
not really pointy or shop or anyway and
once<00:03:37.110> again<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.500> ears<00:03:37.710> quite<00:03:38.610> low<00:03:39.210> on<00:03:39.240> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
face or from maybe like there that's

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.300 
face or from maybe like there that's
about<00:03:45.360> where<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> ears<00:03:45.870> would<00:03:46.140> be<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.470> then

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
about where the ears would be and then

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.390 
about where the ears would be and then
you<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.330> put<00:03:51.660> in<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.960> hair<00:03:52.170> which<00:03:52.530> as<00:03:52.830> usual

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
you can put in the hair which as usual

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.910 
you can put in the hair which as usual

that<00:04:10.290> could<00:04:10.530> be<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.890> word<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:17.400> bring<00:04:17.640> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
that could be the word and you bring the

head<00:04:18.120> around

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.480 

and<00:04:26.140> just<00:04:27.140> like<00:04:27.410> how<00:04:27.770> I<00:04:27.800> did<00:04:28.220> with<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.060> video<00:04:30.490> -

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
and just like how I did with the video -

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.620 
and just like how I did with the video -
for<00:04:32.180> how<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.360> draw<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:33.520> chibi<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.730> facing<00:04:35.150> just

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
for how to draw a chibi a facing just

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.990 
for how to draw a chibi a facing just
straight<00:04:35.930> forward<00:04:36.260> I'm<00:04:37.160> just<00:04:37.460> gonna<00:04:37.610> drill

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
straight forward I'm just gonna drill

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.790 
straight forward I'm just gonna drill
the<00:04:38.210> hair<00:04:38.420> into<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:39.020> ponytail<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.570> if<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:42.410> want

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
the hair into a ponytail and if you want

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.930 
the hair into a ponytail and if you want
you<00:04:42.980> can<00:04:43.190> look<00:04:43.970> at<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:45.190> other<00:04:46.190> video<00:04:46.550> and

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
you can look at the other video and

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.880 
you can look at the other video and
compare<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.630> two<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.960> them<00:04:49.780> which<00:04:50.780> could<00:04:51.560> help

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
compare the two of them which could help

00:04:51.890 --> 00:05:00.490 
compare the two of them which could help
you<00:04:56.110> when<00:04:57.110> you<00:04:57.230> draw<00:04:58.390> do<00:04:59.390> this<00:04:59.630> that<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.260> then

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
you when you draw do this that and then

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.820 
you when you draw do this that and then
you<00:05:00.590> can<00:05:00.770> just<00:05:00.950> bring<00:05:01.190> around<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.730> hairline

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
you can just bring around the hairline

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:12.550 
you can just bring around the hairline
there<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.850> have<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.420> neck<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:07.460> there<00:05:11.560> and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
there and have the neck in there and

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.320 
there and have the neck in there and
then<00:05:12.680> then<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:12.980> would<00:05:13.310> be<00:05:13.490> pretty<00:05:13.940> far<00:05:14.480> back

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
then then it would be pretty far back

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:25.120 
then then it would be pretty far back
and<00:05:18.460> show<00:05:19.460> again<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:23.050> a<00:05:24.050> little<00:05:24.200> bit<00:05:24.440> time<00:05:24.650> the

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
and show again and a little bit time the

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.620 
and show again and a little bit time the
chibi<00:05:25.730> doesn't<00:05:26.120> come<00:05:26.360> until<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:27.550> put<00:05:28.550> in<00:05:28.730> the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
chibi doesn't come until you put in the

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.340 
chibi doesn't come until you put in the
rest<00:05:30.080> of<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.500> body<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.970> I'll<00:05:32.300> just<00:05:32.570> draw<00:05:33.020> in

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
rest of the body so I'll just draw in

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.230 
rest of the body so I'll just draw in
sort<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.310> arm<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:34.940> shoulders<00:05:35.540> quickly

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
sort of the arm and shoulders quickly

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:52.230 
sort of the arm and shoulders quickly
and<00:05:39.100> just<00:05:40.100> make<00:05:41.000> them<00:05:41.240> short

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.129 

and<00:05:52.620> there<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:53.830> have<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:54.460> bit<00:05:54.759> of<00:05:54.940> Achebe<00:05:58.139> next

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
and there you have a bit of Achebe next

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.490 
and there you have a bit of Achebe next
video<00:05:59.440> will<00:05:59.949> probably<00:05:59.979> be<00:06:00.490> on<00:06:01.300> during<00:06:02.259> the

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
video will probably be on during the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.939 
video will probably be on during the
chibis<00:06:03.210> body<00:06:04.210> proportions<00:06:05.110> so<00:06:06.810> you<00:06:07.810> can<00:06:08.110> look

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
chibis body proportions so you can look
