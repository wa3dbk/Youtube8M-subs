00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
I've been playing with some of the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.270 
I've been playing with some of the
attachments<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:40.980> asm1<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
attachments on the asm1 and I know that

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.740 
attachments on the asm1 and I know that
the<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:46.050> Speak<00:00:46.410> Easy<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.820> asm1<00:00:48.329> elite

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the the Speak Easy on the asm1 elite

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.450 
the the Speak Easy on the asm1 elite
version<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> real<00:00:50.129> good<00:00:50.280> gun

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
version there's a real good gun

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
version there's a real good gun
especially<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> start<00:00:51.300> putting

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
especially when you start putting

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
especially when you start putting
somewhat<00:00:51.899> attachments<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.039> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
somewhat attachments on there but I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
somewhat attachments on there but I
wanted<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> share<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> guys<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
wanted to share with you guys that you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.150 
wanted to share with you guys that you
guys<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.320> turn<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> ASM<00:00:57.270> ones<00:00:57.859> into<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
guys can turn one of the ASM ones into a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.090 
guys can turn one of the ASM ones into a
Speak<00:00:59.699> Easy<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.109> very<00:01:01.350> closely<00:01:01.680> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
Speak Easy so that very closely that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250 
Speak Easy so that very closely that
makes<00:01:02.370> sense<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.910> turn<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.049> those

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
makes sense you can turn one of those

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
makes sense you can turn one of those
into<00:01:04.470> an<00:01:04.739> elite<00:01:05.070> without<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:05.790> having<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
into an elite without actually having to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.270 
into an elite without actually having to
get<00:01:06.330> an<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.600> an<00:01:06.840> elite<00:01:07.290> version<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> asm1

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
get an a an elite version of the asm1

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.820 
get an a an elite version of the asm1
speakeasy<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> wanted<00:01:10.740> to

at<00:01:30.329> twelve<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.049> started<00:01:31.409> thinking<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.759> can

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
at twelve so I started thinking what can

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.990 
at twelve so I started thinking what can
I<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:34.470> ahead<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> improve<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.670> gun

I do to go ahead and improve this gun

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.810 
I do to go ahead and improve this gun
and<00:01:36.990> try<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.710> close<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.159> possible<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and try to get as close as possible to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
and try to get as close as possible to
try<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> actually<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.810> an<00:01:40.020> elite<00:01:40.320> version

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
try to actually get an elite version

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.149 
try to actually get an elite version
such<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.820> speakeasy<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.040> other

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
such as the speakeasy so all the other

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.679 
such as the speakeasy so all the other
guns<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> I've<00:01:44.700> done<00:01:44.909> these<00:01:45.180> these<00:01:45.450> three

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
guns that I've done these these three

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.530 
guns that I've done these these three
right<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> say<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
right here I would have to say if you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
right here I would have to say if you
don't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> ASM<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.500> magnitude<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> try

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
as soon as it comes to use it because

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.190 
as soon as it comes to use it because
this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:54.600> gonna<00:01:54.720> put<00:01:54.990> in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
this is the one that I'm gonna put in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.170

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
similar to the asm1 speakeasy and now

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.219 
similar to the asm1 speakeasy and now
you<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.060> an<00:02:00.149> elite<00:02:00.420> version<00:02:00.899> what<00:02:01.020> they'll

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you have an elite version what they'll

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.289 
you have an elite version what they'll
have<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> elite<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.159> makes<00:02:02.430> sense<00:02:02.759> so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
have in the elite of that makes sense so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539

I've tried this with the record I tried

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.510 
I've tried this with the record I tried
it<00:02:35.660> with<00:02:35.720> asm1<00:02:36.200> original<00:02:36.830> but<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.220> one<00:02:37.400> that

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
it with asm1 original but the one that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.180 
it with asm1 original but the one that
comes<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> closest<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.410> making<00:02:39.800> and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
comes the closest to it to making and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.180 
comes the closest to it to making and
converting<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.540> magnitude<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.770> be<00:02:42.950> almost
