getting Florida so now one of the first
skills<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.159> can<00:00:59.309> work<00:00:59.429> on<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.789> precision

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
skills you can work on with precision

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
skills you can work on with precision
trainers<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.199> lay<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.559> lengthwise<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
trainers is to lay them lengthwise and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.520 
trainers is to lay them lengthwise and
just<00:01:02.550> use<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.059> balance<00:01:03.510> beam<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.379> work

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
just use them as a balance beam to work

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.200 
just use them as a balance beam to work
on<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:05.010> rail<00:01:05.190> balance<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.730> a<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.030> low

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
on your rail balance at a really low

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.560 
on your rail balance at a really low
level<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.409> two<00:01:07.770> three<00:01:08.520> foot<00:01:08.880> precision

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
level so I have two three foot precision

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.350 
level so I have two three foot precision
trainers<00:01:09.990> end<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> end<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.360> demonstrate

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
trainers end to end here and demonstrate

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
trainers end to end here and demonstrate
you<00:01:13.079> can<00:01:13.259> walk<00:01:13.439> heel<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> toe<00:01:14.100> across<00:01:14.490> you're

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you can walk heel to toe across you're

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
you can walk heel to toe across you're
trying<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.450> find<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> bar<00:01:15.930> between<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> first

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
trying to find the bar between the first

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.240 
trying to find the bar between the first
and<00:01:16.920> second<00:01:17.310> toe<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> your<00:01:17.790> feet

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.820 

so<00:01:25.760> just<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:25.970> really<00:01:26.180> basic<00:01:26.480> low<00:01:27.230> balance<00:01:27.650> in

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
so just a really basic low balance in

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.450 
so just a really basic low balance in
the<00:01:27.950> train<00:01:28.190> on<00:01:28.370> same<00:01:29.240> thing<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:29.780> work<00:01:29.930> on

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
the train on same thing you can work on

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.040 
the train on same thing you can work on
quadrupedal<00:01:31.460> movement<00:01:31.580> or<00:01:32.120> first<00:01:32.600> even<00:01:32.900> just

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
quadrupedal movement or first even just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.760 
quadrupedal movement or first even just
getting<00:01:33.230> into<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:34.040> plank<00:01:34.550> position<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:35.270> work<00:01:35.390> on

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
getting into a plank position to work on

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.350 
getting into a plank position to work on
some<00:01:36.770> strange<00:01:37.100> from<00:01:37.370> there<00:01:37.580> we're<00:01:38.090> going<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.330> a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
some strange from there we're going on a

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.530 
some strange from there we're going on a
grip<00:01:38.720> strength

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
grip strength

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.480 
grip strength
so<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.050> pocket<00:01:42.500> peddle<00:01:42.860> movement<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.190> can<00:01:43.340> do

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
so the pocket peddle movement you can do

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.330 
so the pocket peddle movement you can do
on<00:01:43.640> here<00:01:43.880> maybe<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.840> work<00:01:45.530> on<00:01:45.770> some<00:01:46.100> cat

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
on here maybe to work on some cat

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.070 
on here maybe to work on some cat
balance<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:50.030> I'm<00:01:50.120> going<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.510> opposite

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
balance so I'm going to the opposite

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:59.500 
balance so I'm going to the opposite
hand<00:01:51.290> opposite<00:01:51.950> foot<00:01:52.010> together

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.050 

all<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.290> way<00:02:00.380> down<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:01.580> can<00:02:01.610> use<00:02:01.910> the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
all the way down you can use the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.920 
all the way down you can use the
trainers<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:03.110> work<00:02:03.290> on<00:02:04.150> just<00:02:05.150> balance<00:02:05.630> as<00:02:05.780> if

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
trainers to work on just balance as if

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.620 
trainers to work on just balance as if
you<00:02:06.050> are<00:02:06.140> on<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> slackline<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:07.910> it's<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.270> hard

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
you are on a slackline so it's a hard

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.780 
you are on a slackline so it's a hard
