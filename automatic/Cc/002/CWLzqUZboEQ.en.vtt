00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.500
 3 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.500
 and the state 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.790
 now we are in this case with the lg the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.410
 e3 the style the e3 which is a telephone 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.790
 low range that will come to the market 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.680
 Argentina about almost 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.060
 five hundred forty-nine pesos with a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.860
 postpaid plan depending on what 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 operator we will have but not 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.360
 We have a 3.2 inch screen with 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 a resolution of 240 x 320 in the most 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.879
 back in the injured part we're going to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.890
 find with a 3.2 camera 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.900
 megapixels that read it here says 3.0 that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.400
 it's actually 3.2 and actually good 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.260
 it's a phone that's good even if it's from 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.420
 low range the truth that the fluidity that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 we can see quickly it 's pretty 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 good finally range phones 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 low maybe they do not work so fluids 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
 like this phone the screen is a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.210
 slightly higher than the average of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.769
 phones the low we know but 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.150
 Well of course we can not demand 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.100
 the very important editions by 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.030
 colors are going to be washed 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.190
 remember again is a phone 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.650
 pretty cheap we also have a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.810
 single core processor cortex to 5 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.190
 at 500 megahertz that good is also a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.780
 pretty old processor but so 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.729
 less is enough for tasks 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.830
 that we are going to be able to do with the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 lg the e3 likewise on the inside 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.680
 we are going to find a battery of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.330
 1100 2000 jumper now and comes 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.430
 preloaded directly with android 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.740
 gingerbread android 2 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 the line l 5 and the 7 that we are going to see 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.630
 now between a while they have directly 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.060
 a spring sandwich android 4.0 is not known 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 and I really do not think it was going to get ice 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.610
 cream sandwich for this phone 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 also directly does not support it for 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.000
 a hardware issue but at least 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.580
 It works pretty well with bedbugs and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 maybe I do not need an update is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.940
 a sandwich we are also again 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 in the launch event of the line 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.390
 l of lg in this case we are showing 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.940
 the lg l 5 that comes to be the telephone of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 medium low range of lg for 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.570
 Argentina will have a price of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.950
 approximately 800 99 pesos with a plan 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.630
 please of course it will vary 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 depending on the operator in which the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.930
 let's go buy but it really is a 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.580
 pretty interesting price for a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.140
 phone these features has a 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.080
 4 - inch screen with a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.880
 resolution of 320 x 480 pixels and 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.940
 we also have in the back a 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.350
 5 megapixel camera with a led flash 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.030
 in the internal part we are going to 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.850
 find with a single processor 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.050
 core at 800 megahertz and the gpu is a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.330
 adreno 220 nemos 500m bytes of rom and 2.5 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.470
 Internal storage gb released 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.060
 for the user of course we are 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.340
 running ice cream sanwich 4 points 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.750
 3 coming factory with the phone is 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.790
 one of the few phones in Argentina 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.530
 that come directly with this version 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.090
 from android really was very good and 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.620
 is welcome of course comes with the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.209
 classic menu organization is that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.349
 we can see in icing sandwich and 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.239
 really the truth that interface 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.550
 it works very fluidly at least the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.170
 Transition between screens is very good 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.120
 and the same thing happens in the drawer of 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.010
 applications the phone's fibers is 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.810
 really remarkable especially for 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.150
 a mid- range phone and the price 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.860
 that you have, let's see them later in 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.660
 a complete roll on the site in this 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.700
 case we are here with the optimum one is 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.989
 feels that it is the top of the range 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.430
 new line that is showing you that 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.380
 here in Argentina that will have a 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.049
 price of approximately thousand 299 pesos 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.940
 with postpaid plan again of course 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.799
 the price will vary depending on the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.630
 operator that market it but 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.920
 it really is an excellent alternative to 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.599
 the people who are looking for a 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.069
 experience similar to the come to excess 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.110
 for example because we have a screen 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.959
 4.3 inches with a resolution of 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.819
 480 x 800 it shows that this panel that 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.620
 has is not a common lsd panel 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.209
 we are the vision that can be shown 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.500
 they really are quite important in 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.260
 this case the time is not too much for 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.820
 we are with the visual 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.650
 but actually it looks pretty well 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.090
 interface with new end included mind 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.860
 in the back we're going to 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.050
 find with a 5 camera 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.810
 megapixels with led flash that continues not 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.640
 is 720 penn and 1080p is that we consider 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.380
 which is a medium-high- end phones and 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.240
 well we could get to forgive him this 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.710
 subject the camera we still did not have it 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.300
 but what we do see is that the interface 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.520
 not only that it works very fluid if we see 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.290
 that the screen reads the text very well 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.970
 it looks pretty clear and the interface is 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.940
 quite designed and it's very seemed like 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.430
 that would come to be Android 4.0 base by 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.650
 course it comes with android 4.0 ice cream 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.150
 Factory sanwich directly which is 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.500
 one thing that is very welcome so 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
 less on the phones that we see here in 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.220
 argentina not many come directly 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.750
 with ice cream sanwich on your part 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.450
 inside we will find ourselves with a 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.250
 microprocessor arm is 7 to one giga hertz 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.780
 and 512 mb of ram 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.400
 finally we will also find a 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.870
 1700 million battery but what 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.820
 I hope it lasts long the day that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.190
 let's do the complete review of the cousins 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.720
 the x7 so we do not see each other in the next 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.680
 videos I'm nicolÃ¡s fishman from tecnoval 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.680
 operating with org point
