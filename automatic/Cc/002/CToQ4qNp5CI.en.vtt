00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:08.939
 today we're going to see just one kick from the 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.939
 Mr. RamÃ³n Ayala 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.330
 this is the very simple song this 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.220
 has a bit of that clearing we're going to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.650
 see if this 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.680
 you can see how we played it in the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 keyboard first 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.880
 to have 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.880
 well at the beginning I was going to do this 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.900
 With 3 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.900
 you can see 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.780
 spa 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.550
 the mind 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.950
 for once again 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950
 t 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.920
 I 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.140
 has held 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.140
 we go 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.670
 and this one then the most they put the chords 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.670
 nothing more serious 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.350
 it has sustained me 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.240
 what this has on the keyboard 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.660
 good on the accordion 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.170
 the host 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.170
 to see if they can see 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.970
 to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.970
 A) Yes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700
 plus 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.020
 to start reforming 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.780
 let's go to more 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.530
 and here 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.320
 look 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.320
 i 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:31.700
 to me 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.939
 to 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:04:00.770
 more and more 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.530
 sharp with net and the sustained sun 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.530
 as well 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.770
 the lid 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.659
 ah 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.680
 do not forget to comment subscribe to 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.460
 Any doubt this can not say there 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.590
 a friend who told me how to get a 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.050
 song let's make a video of how 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.610
 take out a song I really have a 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:51.660
 This method is too complicated because 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:55.310
 Well, it takes me a while but it 's very effective 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.580
 my method but we 'll see if it comes out 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.580
 see you
