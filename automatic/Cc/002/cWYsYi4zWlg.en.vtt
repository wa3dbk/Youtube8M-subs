00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.840
 Hey guys 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.860
 landmarks fields in the area and more a tutorial 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:16.860
 of Mayan is in this tutorial of the streets priest 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.800
 bank and mep is going to put a relief 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.070
 in our material but this in word to the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.910
 thank more than 500 more than 500 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:33.659
 subscriptions on the channel that we are 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:37.159
 helping people and that is what the 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:42.109
 bank is this 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:45.829
 now it creates more or less relief in the 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:48.929
 in our material that gives an impression 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.440
 well cool for us to do wall make 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.690
 floor rust material in it is well 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.729
 better than you, for example, always 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.039
 that the standard wall is better than 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.780
 put brick by brick 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.269
 besides being heavier at the time of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.610
 indemnify gets legal aspect 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.260
 so we use the bank method 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.700
 to make this legal effect and is what 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.770
 we'll teach gives water to make a 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.050
 point and we need two 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.890
 images the main image the texture that 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.510
 in case 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 mine is this one now and another 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.110
 image that will be the bank of it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 case is the same picture 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 Only black and white can she be. 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.370
 black and white as occurs with 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.860
 brick partitions, among others. 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.710
 little stronger so we can 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.730
 be doing the photoshop but it's the same 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.480
 Image 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.480
 and that black part here is that part more 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.100
 dark of the team lines or are 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.470
 precisely the parts that will remain a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.780
 little deeper in relief to people 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.540
 repair here 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.149
 are themselves from the docking with 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.220
 this darker part that gives texture 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.020
 so we know 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 the bank and we need a texture 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.230
 original and of the same posture 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.590
 only in black and white so you 're 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.800
 doing a jazz tutorial and for him this 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.800
 google image that you think the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.550
 if you came here from the stop and we'll go 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:40.860
 start making a bank in this image of 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:48.900
 a new scene here you can do 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:50.400
 walls can make you want with the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.550
 right button and add a new one 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:13.100
 material the right button to exit matter 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:21.209
 I'll look for a color image and 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:33.350
 colored normally in 3 vs I hope 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:33.350
 I'll beauty straight ahead and see the difference. 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.420
 so is she who the bank of flames near 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.870
 that's the way the bank is now we 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.739
 let's activate the bank in this image 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.860
 We are going to select ours. 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.980
 object here in these keys it 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.650
 attributes oedipus the material always goes 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.450
 be the last to flap you can have a thousand 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.260
 here the material will always be the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.060
 last 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.060
 in the case of my part 2 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.639
 my texture image come out 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.380
 transparency I will not mess with decency 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.410
 I will not mess with the fish like here. 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.790
 I have a bank 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.770
 I'll do the same the same 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.760
 procedure that I do put texture 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.760
 or click here 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.760
 the opening that I want and will appear 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.660
 for me this new land bank value the 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:00.760
 I do not know if I miss it, and it's 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.479
 first choice I'll search the image 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.190
 from the bank 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:09.130
 the color now from the bank and my pre 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.770
 selected black and white beauty here 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.610
 I have these two channels one channel 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:22.620
 entrance and an exit channel a putting 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.620
 output of Oct to this screen again 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.140
 Pan 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.390
 I go out and come back out here and 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:37.240
 bank this second option 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:39.700
 Here it's hit me the river that now we 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.550
 reorganize will get much text will 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.139
 stay that way so strong and will 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.180
 be well done and will not stick 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.749
 Look how you want to do then they had 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:56.340
 10 said I like to use, for example, 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:06:02.009
 census point 200 beauty and i will beat the 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:04.770
 inter here looks colombia is better than 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.159
 with much cooler we up to 300 ac for 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:17.270
 dress best gift 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:17.270
 we beat going out in relation to another 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:26.020
 It's cool, you 300 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:29.290
 So that's what gives a bank this is it. 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.930
 leads this aspect of 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.650
 depth without any smooth bag 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.210
 Look here it 's that close. 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.580

 I'm sure it's a tip that will 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.410
 helping a lot helped me a lot when 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.580

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:05.500

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.760
 the difference increased from 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.690
 to learn then this is required to 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.300
