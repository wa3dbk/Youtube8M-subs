per<00:00:57.670> second<00:00:58.300> which<00:00:58.780> is<00:00:58.810> close<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.290> 2d<00:00:59.800> quality

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
per second which is close to 2d quality

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.109 
per second which is close to 2d quality
whereas<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.590> e71<00:01:02.590> is<00:01:02.950> only<00:01:03.430> capable<00:01:03.730> of

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
whereas the e71 is only capable of

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.109 
whereas the e71 is only capable of
recording<00:01:04.449> video<00:01:04.960> at<00:01:05.229> 15<00:01:05.920> frames<00:01:06.220> per<00:01:06.520> second

recording video at 15 frames per second
so<00:01:07.690> even<00:01:08.500> though<00:01:08.530> it's<00:01:08.860> about<00:01:09.160> half<00:01:09.550> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
so even though it's about half the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
so even though it's about half the
quality<00:01:10.720> of<00:01:10.750> what<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.170> e90<00:01:11.710> can<00:01:11.890> shoot<00:01:12.220> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
quality of what the e90 can shoot the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.880 
quality of what the e90 can shoot the
e71<00:01:13.570> camera<00:01:14.229> i<00:01:14.410> think<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.280> pretty<00:01:15.940> much

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
e71 camera i think is pretty much

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.130 
e71 camera i think is pretty much
sufficient<00:01:17.890> for<00:01:18.490> short<00:01:19.000> videos<00:01:19.420> on<00:01:19.630> youtube

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140
