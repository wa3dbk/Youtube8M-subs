00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:38.180

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:52.550
 played by four plus six easy dice 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:57.200
 with different letters 16 and a small box or 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.500
 not a little piece of paper with a clay 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.370
 inside we 'll see what it's for 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.370
 this mass crushes 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.410
 and this is the credit of the stage step and the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.770
 nursery school 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.080

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.860
 teams of two players in each 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.380
 so the object of the game is your first 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.380
 time to arrive here late afternoon 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.380
 right on arrival and how can we 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.959
 this not even every channel 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.470
 every house here on a trail has a color 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.239
 each course refers to four themes the game 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.340
 and each theme has one has four 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.250
 subcategories for example we have 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.780
 here me Lario cable box and have 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.660
 cool things what they have 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.290
 getting pulled and discarded 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.540
 This is something you do not have in other games. 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.419
 also accumulated a game to be a 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.570
 theme involving dictionary words 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.850
 vocabulary etc. 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.260
 We have a lack of breakdown 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.330
 general knowledge 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.640
 ronaldo in here has four themes 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.590
 né and tb rodrix the polygraph kinescope and 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.229
 So all the little boxes go 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.050
 his letters and themes in four 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:45.560
 subtemas inside we have super astro 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:49.760
 that moves mime music is interpretation is 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.479
 also with four themes and here the pio gas 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.479
 creative 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.930
 a game of the beginning of a house 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.440
 purple color always when the two passed 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.200
 In the house of purple color until the team can go to 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.290
 team can choose the theme that always 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:14.310
 to prefer is a topic you prefer 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.670
 in the cards then choose the topic 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.910
 performs this team players 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.090
 to win, not to be able to fulfill what 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.550
 was requested in the topic play dice in the game 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.410
 the dice is for example that out five goals 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.780
 because the orange team did not accept 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:37.370
 is the challenge at stake of 25 then 12345 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.530
 here they can choose from the back or 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.860
 to go straight here when for our 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.470
 houses with star using double up 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.250
 accept them if they can 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.870
 meet the challenge and using double 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.980
 the winners are twice as long as they have 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.050
 changed the play of imagination and the others 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.690
 too much is that he has some things that 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.669
 they say the absurd 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.390
 if you have the creative in here 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.390
 active 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.820
 we have the option to make a 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.410
 sculpture or sometimes the player has 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.040
 to make carving a carving 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.540
 to make sculpture of a planet when 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.450
 I played once I had to do it. 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.000
 all of saturn, but here is it going 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.700
 something that is quite distinct from it to 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.310
 the other games of party to party game a 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.680
 matter of clay and make the 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.440
 sculpture has to suddenly look for 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.810
 look for things on one side in the house is 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.200
 being the game and bring them with the foot with the 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.300
 head with elbow 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.919
 This is a super fun game and it yields 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.880
 lots of laughs 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.800
 so I gave was the skull a part of 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.910
 very cool and very different from 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.720
 people are used to seeing here in the 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.060
 Brazil 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.760
 different from games as images are already 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.150
 I spoke 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.890

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.120
