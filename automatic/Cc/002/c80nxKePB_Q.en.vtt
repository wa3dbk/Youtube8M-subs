00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:19.029
 it is dawn in the terminal pelÃ¡gio priest one of the busiest of the capital 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.509
 from here dozens of buses connect the region 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.869
 Is not that the center of the city? 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.740
 and the problems start to win 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.479
 6 157 in the morning 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.600
 according to the drivers who make the room where it should be here 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.440
 so because 51 franchise is already waiting here 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.329
 already gave up 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.640
 the bus that is late and by the way 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.829
 is a situation today Queiroz said amazed the party of 70 dollars 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.930
 patients to arrive at the destination without delay is not a 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.950
 easy task 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.850
 six wins 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.790
 ten minutes late now the right people 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.920
 and that's where we'll board too. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.490
 29 terminal activities 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.890
 the bus is leaving if it is full 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.840
 the chosen line was 0 4 2 bi and social cent 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.110
 the journey is long 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.380
 the bus is slowly filling up 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.289
 the obligation to check the cards of students and the elderly 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.289
 helps to delay the trip 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.120
 to meet the schedule established by the company the driver is required to 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.050
 conference with a bus on the move which increases the risk of 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.850
 accidents 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.740
 at this point the vehicle is already full 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 A lot of people have a ball in the front. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.190
 before the ratchet how does your passage 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
 still well 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.240
 due to 9h followed by security 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 the green and red in Germany 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.160
 my beer 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.520
 passengers wonder how they can 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 a woman says that the situation has worsened 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.310
 because there it is with a bus less to get worse it has 115 countries and a half of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.450
 Wednesday afternoon with a full bus sometimes 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.680
 stop at the closed points with about an hour's travel 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.710
 the driver just informed that it is already delayed more than ten minutes 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.190
 ie with a delay that in the end will have to be compensated in some way 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.529
 know more 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.529
 there was also nothing to do but dance to dance 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.039
 father and mother my boss but the theme is on the agenda 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.819
 in the back the driver has to show agility 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.290
 with 7 43 at the moment we should already be in the terminal 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.310
 at least 5 minutes 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.920
 I should have left by now. 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.259
 another trip 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:45.249
 if you want 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.569
 get here not be identified and stuck driver 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.630
 will have to run 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.159
 a congestion delays the journey even more 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.269
 the bus back to the terminal after more than two hours bus know of 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.269
 back to the terminal exactly 18 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.870
 and now causes cascade effect 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.360
 what you see are drivers and do start another trip 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.370
 he distanced himself from the accumulated 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.699
 until the end of the day 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:17.199
 the bus line 04 then traveled 42 kilometers while hours in six 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.919
 minutes 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.819
 it was 18 minutes late 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.589
 in relation to the spreadsheet determined by the company 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.879
 we talked to a public transport driver who did not want to 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.829
 identify 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.269
 he admits that to get there in time, you have to step on the accelerator 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.389

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.159

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.180
 the cable, we can rudder 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.890
 I do not know no memories 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.539
 the teacher came in his own business 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.619
 the proleite reads post 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.019
 after that the respect to the pedestrian range of the agent 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.719
 If they do not obey the timetable, the driver says that he 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.799
 Company punishments till school agent if too much of this timeco 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.879

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.360
 year according to the president of cmtc respect for traffic laws must 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.420
 being above the worksheets and schedules no driver is required to have 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.379

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.900

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:36.970

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.400
 standard procedure for drivers 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.530
 nor does it not disturb their work since, according to the transfer, the number of 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.740
 is not so great so it tells me how the transpetro was born 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.390
