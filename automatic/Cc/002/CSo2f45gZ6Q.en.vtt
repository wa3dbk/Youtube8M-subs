it's a really nice fit but as you can
see<00:01:00.450> it<00:01:01.450> doesn't<00:01:01.630> go<00:01:01.840> straight<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.470> corner

something<00:01:10.660> to<00:01:11.290> keep<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.740> cover<00:01:12.520> up<00:01:12.730> so<00:01:13.150> it

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
something to keep the cover up so it

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.810 
something to keep the cover up so it
gets<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.900> edges<00:01:14.200> but<00:01:14.860> I<00:01:15.100> like<00:01:15.400> it<00:01:15.550> as<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.700> is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820
