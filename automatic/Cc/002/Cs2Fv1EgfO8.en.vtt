00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.519
 and conquer renegade x over the network and how 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.480
 create a server for this game for this 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.289
 we will need the game link itself to this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.270
 torrent file I will leave in the description and all 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.300
 and nothing else we need it 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.380
 open testing so you downloaded 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.239
 the game installed it like all normal games 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.800
 and now you have to connect here by 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.190
 such a scheme so in the launcher you choose 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.090
 server gives and connect and choose 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.489
 server and right click join 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.379
 and the game starts loading and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.809
 automatically connect to the selected 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.570
 server or in the main in the main menu

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.920
 and port press joy 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.970
 If you want to create a server you do 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.340
 it will be harder if you want to create 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.939
 server then restart the installation 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.970

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.520
 and check the server profile and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.530
 install it in a different folder as the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.990

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.189
 installed server that is in the folder 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.700

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:25.819
 renegate installation is the way to our 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:32.069
 folder with the server that is valid 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:36.090
 let's say your game server is in Wed x 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.880
 server admin password is admin 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.540

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.209
 admin password 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.970
 and instead of this, write your own 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.830
 password let's say there 1 2 3 port 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.680
 makes the engine use 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:58.340
 specific port for example write minus 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:01.370
 port 1337 well, and do not use port 77 78 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:11.600
