00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.640
 saxophone to the whole subject from the other 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.770
 table of the northern raieleros for the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.330
 Alto saxophone is in the tone of F major 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.490
 that would be the flat major for the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 accordion and bass sixth major fa in the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.130
 alto saxophone carries all the notes 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.140
 except if natural if it's going to be flat 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.519
 on this scale then the scale is fa 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.519

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 principle a decoration that is repeated and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
 then a melody that also leads to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.130
 half and it also serves us as final the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.130
 first melody is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.350
 Y 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.610

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:13.869

 Solfa to me those are all the notes for 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.049
 that side part in the next part is 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.200
 an ornament that serves as a preparation 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.330
 the chorus and the chorus are two 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 parts then also to half of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.490
 the refrains we play the same adornment 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.310
 also inside the song and then the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.230
 another melody that we have is 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.820
 practically imitating what he does in 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.820
 a part of the chorus 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.340
 but 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.340
 i 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.920
 i 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.560
 the notes begin to who the side 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.480
 side for the flap 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:07.060

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:15.340

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.660
 the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:30.780
 the adolf to my father 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:36.060

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.410
 solfa re solved me a little more 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.500
 slow down all that part so that I can 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.500
 follow and see the notes here are 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 m 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.510
 to live 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.069
 my mother 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.060
 d 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.300
 already after this we go back again 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.480
 up to him 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.160
 the section see as the preparation or the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.100
 second verse before entering the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.200
 refrain we repeat all that and as 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.810
 final, all we do is touch another 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.290
 time that second melody and already when 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.290
 finished 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.480
 we hold that note to me 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.530
 and the last note is a natural gift there 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.660
