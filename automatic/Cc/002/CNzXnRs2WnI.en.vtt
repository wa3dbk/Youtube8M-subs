relatively incredible breakthrough in

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.880 
relatively incredible breakthrough in
nanotechnology<00:00:19.550> it's<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.500> mean<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.680> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
nanotechnology it's I mean it really is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.029 
nanotechnology it's I mean it really is
incredible<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.430> took<00:00:23.550> me<00:00:23.670> years<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.119> years<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039

incredible it took me years and years to
just<00:00:26.039> come<00:00:26.189> up<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.460> prototype<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
just come up with a prototype and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.450 
just come up with a prototype and
finally<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.849> something<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.080> show

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
finally I have something that I can show

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.330 
finally I have something that I can show
sort<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> sell<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:33.000> idea<00:00:33.710> with<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.130> just

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
sort of sell my idea with and it's just

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
sort of sell my idea with and it's just
really<00:00:35.520> great<00:00:36.200> little<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.469> mean<00:00:37.680> probably

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
really great little I mean probably

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.459 
really great little I mean probably
about<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> size<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.059> pinky<00:00:39.690> thumbnail<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
about the size of my pinky thumbnail I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.490 
about the size of my pinky thumbnail I
mean<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.219> small<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.469> could<00:00:43.469> see

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
mean really really small you could see

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.369 
mean really really small you could see
and<00:00:46.760> basically<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.960> hoping

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and basically you know it's I'm hoping

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.209 
and basically you know it's I'm hoping
it<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> Shelf<00:00:50.600> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.629> next

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
it it to be on the Shelf in the next

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
it it to be on the Shelf in the next
year<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.399> let's<00:00:54.300> produce<00:00:54.570> them

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
year or so let's produce them

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.610 
year or so let's produce them
that's<00:00:55.980> obviously<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.520> goal<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:58.430> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
that's obviously my goal I will see and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's obviously my goal I will see and
and<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.829> gonna<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.070> great<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.609> and
