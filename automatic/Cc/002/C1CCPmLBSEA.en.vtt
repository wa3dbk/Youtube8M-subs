00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
actually a lot more stable now I didn't

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.700 
actually a lot more stable now I didn't
see<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:56.630> i<00:02:56.720> was<00:02:56.750> slipping<00:02:57.140> over<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.530> yeah

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.710 

so<00:03:15.380> apart<00:03:16.099> from<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.489> ldh<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.150> there<00:03:17.480> anything

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
so apart from the ldh is there anything

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.780 
so apart from the ldh is there anything
else<00:03:17.959> different<00:03:18.140> about<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.680> f-sport<00:03:19.160> versus

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
else different about the f-sport versus

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.850 
else different about the f-sport versus
the<00:03:19.910> 350<00:03:20.390> well<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.110> grills<00:03:21.349> different<00:03:21.709> as<00:03:21.830> you

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
the 350 well the grills different as you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.290 
the 350 well the grills different as you
can<00:03:22.069> see<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.370> made<00:03:22.550> up<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.790> these<00:03:22.880> little<00:03:23.180> F

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
can see it's made up of these little F

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.210 
can see it's made up of these little F
shapes<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:24.440> there<00:03:24.650> are<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.770> wheels<00:03:24.980> which

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
shapes then there are the wheels which

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.920 
shapes then there are the wheels which
are<00:03:25.310> 19<00:03:25.610> inches<00:03:25.880> now<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.270> two<00:03:26.450> tone<00:03:26.660> but<00:03:26.840> of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.420 
are 19 inches now and two tone but of
course<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.260> brakes<00:03:27.470> are<00:03:27.650> bigger<00:03:28.040> like<00:03:28.280> to

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
course the brakes are bigger like to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.940 
course the brakes are bigger like to
performance<00:03:29.020> anything<00:03:30.020> on<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.140> inside<00:03:30.470> quite

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
performance anything on the inside quite

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.530 
performance anything on the inside quite
a<00:03:30.980> bit<00:03:31.190> let's<00:03:31.370> check<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.580> out<00:03:31.670> let's<00:03:32.030> do<00:03:32.150> that

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.910 

so<00:03:35.540> now<00:03:35.690> we're<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:35.989> f<00:03:36.230> sport<00:03:36.440> what's
