petroleum-based plastic the banana peel
is<00:00:48.180> something<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.660> throw<00:00:48.870> away<00:00:49.050> every<00:00:49.530> day<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is something we throw away every day but

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.040 
is something we throw away every day but
little<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.059> those<00:00:51.420> peels<00:00:51.780> may<00:00:51.989> be

increases<00:00:59.670> each<00:00:59.940> year<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.870> reason<00:01:01.109> why<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
increases each year the reason why I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.830 
increases each year the reason why I
anticipated<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.059> banana<00:01:03.359> peel<00:01:03.629> could

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
anticipated that the banana peel could

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
anticipated that the banana peel could
be<00:01:03.960> used<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> production<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.979> plastic<00:01:05.400> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
be used in the production of plastic is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
be used in the production of plastic is
that<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> contains<00:01:06.270> starch<00:01:06.630> which<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> key

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
that it contains starch which is a key

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
ingredients in the production of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.690 
ingredients in the production of
bioplastic<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.710> had<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> raw<00:01:11.010> material<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bioplastic I had the raw material and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
bioplastic I had the raw material and
the<00:01:11.790> key<00:01:12.180> ingredient<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.080> i<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> develop

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the key ingredient now i had to develop

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.399 
the key ingredient now i had to develop
a<00:01:14.040> method<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.600> i<00:01:15.750> had<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> research

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
a method to do this i had to research

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
a method to do this i had to research

solution<00:01:49.079> prior<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> preparation<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
solution prior to the preparation of the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.730 
solution prior to the preparation of the
plastic<00:01:50.939> both<00:01:51.180> trials<00:01:51.600> were<00:01:51.780> successful<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
plastic both trials were successful and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
plastic both trials were successful and
they<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.220> shown<00:01:53.280> any<00:01:53.729> signs<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.240> decay

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
they have not shown any signs of decay

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.830 
they have not shown any signs of decay
for<00:01:54.990> 2<00:01:55.140> months<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> Counting

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
for 2 months and Counting

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.050 
for 2 months and Counting
so<00:01:57.840> why<00:01:58.079> used<00:01:58.380> banana<00:01:58.799> plastic<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.820> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so why used banana plastic because it is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
so why used banana plastic because it is
cheaper<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.540> make<00:02:00.840> them<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> petroleum-based

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
cheaper to make them the petroleum-based

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.130 
cheaper to make them the petroleum-based
plastic<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.549> currently<00:02:02.759> use<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.540> recycles

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
plastic we currently use and is recycles

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.289 
plastic we currently use and is recycles
a<00:02:04.200> waste<00:02:04.380> material<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> future<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.880> hope

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
a waste material in the future I hope

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.880 
a waste material in the future I hope
that<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> plastic<00:02:07.140> will<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.500> used<00:02:07.710> in

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that this plastic will be used in

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.369 
that this plastic will be used in
different<00:02:08.039> new<00:02:08.610> areas<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> will<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.899> able<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
different new areas and will be able to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.960 
different new areas and will be able to
be<00:02:10.530> produced<00:02:11.039> worldwide

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970

and this was my project I like I like
the<00:02:18.580> little<00:02:18.820> drawings<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.330> was<00:02:19.420> kind<00:02:19.600> of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the little drawings that was kind of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.300 
the little drawings that was kind of
cool<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.140> their<00:02:20.530> science<00:02:20.860> think<00:02:21.070> they're<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
cool and their science think they're I

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310 
cool and their science think they're I
mean<00:02:21.550> come<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.850> like<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.300> know<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.810> was<00:02:23.140> never

would<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.270> thought<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.020> use<00:02:29.050> bananas<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
would have thought to use bananas and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.050 
would have thought to use bananas and
bio<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.130> engineering<00:02:30.580> that's<00:02:30.700> pretty<00:02:30.910> cool

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
bio and engineering that's pretty cool

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
so she's fifty thousand dollars and then

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.780 
so she's fifty thousand dollars and then
she<00:03:12.130> gets<00:03:12.310> help<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.930> develop<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.550> mean

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
she gets help to develop this I mean

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.670 
she gets help to develop this I mean
this<00:03:15.910> could<00:03:16.120> be<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:17.140> would<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> huge

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
this could be this would be a huge

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.530 
this could be this would be a huge
change<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.459> mean<00:03:18.580> this<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> problem<00:03:19.239> we<00:03:19.330> think

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
change I mean this is a problem we think

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.699 
change I mean this is a problem we think
about<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:19.840> always<00:03:19.989> talked<00:03:20.320> about<00:03:20.380> gas

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
about we always talked about gas
