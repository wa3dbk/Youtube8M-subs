00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.020
 for the last of catechesis and Lent 2008 we are in the basilica of 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.640
 san vincenzo di galliano in cantÃ¹ a basilica where on 2 July the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.300
 Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi along with the other Lombard bishops accelerated 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.230
 the millennial of a religious installation that is linked to the heart and to the 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.940
 history of a territory like that of the high-city canturina a basilica 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.190
 qua di san vincenzo which linked in particular to the name of ariberto da 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.330
 they intimidate a bishop who, a thousand years ago, was able to catalyze the women around him 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.100
 forces of rebirth of a territory and coming out of the dark ages of the Middle Ages 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.750
 she succeeded in finding precisely within the Christian faith 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.320
 stimuli to rebuild a fabric that has come to us gradually until then 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.040
 very significant religious and social fabric and then it is beautiful in the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.390
 I also remember Ariio da Intimiano in this Basilica of San Vincenzo Adi 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.479
 Galiano in his baptistery still reflect on baptism baptism that the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.610
 punto fondan tel. spring and what faith we are then called to 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.800
 testify every day in our daily lives and are significant 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.200
 also the only two words that ariberto da intimiano left as above 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.979
 written legacy 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:19.479
 belly diary two Latin words appear lux world light of the world and then 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.239
 in view of the Christians who must be light of the world, let us listen to this 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.379
 evening the reflection of Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi on baptism and us 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 thus we prepare light within our daily life also in 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.379
 view of the next easter 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:56.590
 of place where the archbishop holds the last Lenten catechesis 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.690
 ideally reconnects to the early Christian baptistery of San Giovanni alle 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.869
 sources under the cathedral of Milan from which the route originated 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:09.449
 if indeed the baptistery of Italian certainly arose after the fifth century e 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.629
 perhaps even in the eleventh 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.689
 that never laugh fully romantic it appears in any case a building well 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.909
 characterized hey detached from the basilica next to it 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.909
 this location allowed the taking place on Easter night of the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.299
 baptismal liturgy comprising the solemn procession that led to me 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.319
 I have baptized from the bridge of rebirth to the Eucharistic table to which one is 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.499
 they were approaching for the first time 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:39.749
 for this purpose, at Galiano, a portico now lost univaq directly the two new ones 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.169
 of worship 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.969
 outside the baptistery with architectural forms in which the elements of the constitution 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.320
 complex elements alternate 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.940
 revealing at the top of the building octagonal contributions with overlying 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.719
 dome 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.659
 if generally in Christian art the dome alludes to the perfection of god e 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.109
 to infinity the octagon can refer to the 8 sides of the baptistery wanted by 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.109
 sant'ambrogio for the ancient cathedral of Milan 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.099
 the interior of the baptistery, unlike many other similar buildings, is 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.369
 established does not go 1 mazda 2 bathrooms 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:20.129
 the first of rectangular shape is very small hey probably served as 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:21.349
 anteroom 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.409
 it is possible to imagine the thoughts of the catechumens entering the baptistery 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:30.159
 through these input that was the last threshold for them 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.289
 of the sacrament 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.830
 the possibility of rethinking the journey taken and deciding whether to return to the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.240
 own steps or confirm the choice that had led them up to that point 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.080
 follows the main square-plan laura in which it is partially immersed in 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.580
 floor is placed at the large monolithic basin of the baptismal font 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.779
 4 corner columns support large arches that open into four niches 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:01.389
 circular signs the architectural plan that is outlined and thus shaped like a cross 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.519
 and the thing is certainly not accidental, the catechumen is indeed with baptism 

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:10.639
 united inextricably to death at the resurrection of Christ 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.530
 in the niche opposite the entrance and placed the altar enriched by one 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.360
 engraving bearing the monogram of christ called chrismon 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.110
 drawing consists of two Greek letters 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.379
 can and the rock of the word chris tax christ 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.920
 There are various types 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.920
 the most widespread is the one that inserts the monogram into a laurel wreath 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.000
 with clear reference to the christ king winner keith jarret india in time 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.469
 the circle in the sign of infinity 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.209
 other times the first and last letters of the alphabet are read on the sides 

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:48.479
 Greek the alpha the name gamma remembrance of the affirmation of the same christ 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.020
 in the book of the apocalypse I am the alpha and the omega 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.939
 in the beginning and at the end 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.150
 finally in the cathedral of milan the crismon can be seen 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:03.379
 crossed by eight rays that start from the center remember the 8 beatitudes 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.069
 this typology attributed to sant'ambrogio connects the sign 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.309
 christ badge on the baptismal octagon 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.629
 among the decorations remained on the dome of the Baptistery of Calliano are worth mentioning 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.029
 8-pointed stars 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.449
 a reminder of the light of grace for which new life is reborn 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.000
 in the fray above the entrance instead of the kneeling figure with one 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:27.279
 candle in hand 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.100
 give the image of one of the most significant moments of the ritual 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.750
 when the baptized person is entrusted to the light of faith to be kept always on
