00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello at text age we have one here 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.080
 first look at nokia lumia 10 20 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.390
 and its camera for you the windows 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.880
 phone 8 device has a 41 megapixel 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.230
 snap with optical image stabilizer 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.850
 the huge resolution is quite 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.230
 useful because the sensor is about 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.810
 five and a half times as big as at 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.279
 smartphones common in the camera app 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.510
 we can just get here with one 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.430
 pressure on the trigger 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.800
 and that's exactly how she looks with the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 factory settings off with a second one 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.239
 pressure on the trigger shoots from lumia 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.730
 10 20 now two photos one with full 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 resolution and one with five megapixels 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.510
 but more on that later 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 We've finally got that up here 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 various settings options for 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 example to lightning to white balance too 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.780
 focus iso-sensitivity shutter time 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.340
 and exposure compensation for example 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.020
 I need to adjust the exposure 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 now just up here on the edge and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.770
 to wipe down and you can already see how 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.989
 the image brightness corresponding 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 then it will work as well 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 Focus the manual while doing it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.900
 Of course, something is questionable whether the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 sharpness of a 40 megapixel photos 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.689
 a 1 megapixel display really 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.580
 can accurately control 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 a wipe from right to left shows 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 all settings on 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 once with a second as set 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.400
 I set them all to factory settings 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.140
 I have the huge resolution back 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.630
 now the possibility lossless into 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.369
 zoom into the picture without loss 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.320
 here, of course, only on the 5 megapixel 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.530
 photo not to the high-resolution 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 picture after the lumia 10 20 also here 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.920
 shot both shots again 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.630
 I can still after the recording 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.409
 the picture detail and the picture angle 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.060
 change 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.680
 So I can go here after that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960
 Zoom out and take a picture 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.119
 completely different photo put together 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 so I make then from a single 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.540
 foto quasi several different 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.680
 recordings and can be separated 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.680
 save from each other 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.520
 to switch to video mode laundry 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.530
 I just go down here 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.080
 when filming, there are also in 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.240
 digital zoom of the 41 megapixel sensor 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.160
 offers for full hd video with his 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.660
 two megapixels provide a lot of room for 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.700
 increase lossless 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.350
 here are also the optical 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.950
 image stabilizer still strong 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.950
 support 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.230
 if you want to think here now 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.490
 we'll give you a quick look 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.500
 show what you are for 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.880
 Exposure needs here are 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.650
 a band in front of the window 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.420
 the contrast is too high for the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.760
 Camera outside is too bright 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.290
 the band is too dark and here I can 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.890
 now just the brightness accordingly 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.480
 to adjust 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.130
 For example, I can do the band correctly 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.840
 exposed or when I am with the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.420
 Singing can not do anything easy 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.250
 new york skyline a hdr mode 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.080
 Unfortunately we did not see it 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.520
 but the camera would have synonymous 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.240
 several photos in quick succession 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.060
 shoot 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.040
 but the amount of data is at 41 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.860
 Megapixel shots just became too 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.920
 that's exactly what the reason is 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.900
 why htc with four mega or ultra 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.130
 Pixels at the other end of the flagpole 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.240
 stop, let's have a look 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.710
 Quickly access the accessories 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.780
 Here we see the wireless charging 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.490
 cover that I simply click on 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.970
 and then a wireless charging of the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:43.070
 batteries allows more interesting is the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.200
 camera cover the one on the top 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.260
 two stage trigger will bring you one 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.330
 pronounced handle has by 1020 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.430
 milli hp battery plugged in and on 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.740
 the bottom as you can see here 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.240
 a tripod thread has let it 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.640
 then also in practice the mentioned 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.830
 long-term exposures do that 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.510
 Incidentally, lumia 10 20 connects via 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.160
 micro usb port with the accessory part 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.260
 it was time with a few first 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.300
 press to refrain from lumia 10 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.750
 Thanks for watching and see you 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.750
 next time
