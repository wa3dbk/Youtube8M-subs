00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.100 

it's<00:02:33.030> good<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.329> she's<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.659> yogurt<00:02:33.959> with

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
it's good it she's like yogurt with

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.670 
it's good it she's like yogurt with
ranch<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.670> tangy<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:37.079> I<00:02:37.409> think<00:02:37.590> it's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
ranch it's a tangy and I think it's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.819 
ranch it's a tangy and I think it's
probably<00:02:38.129> like<00:02:38.720> when<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> make<00:02:39.989> ranch<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.590> um

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
probably like when you make ranch it um

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.160 
probably like when you make ranch it um

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the longer it sits the more if the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.500 
the longer it sits the more if the
flavors<00:02:43.560> sort<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:44.069> together<00:02:44.189> so<00:02:44.670> yeah<00:02:45.299> it's
