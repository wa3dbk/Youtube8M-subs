00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
track with a really slow white so it's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.660 
track with a really slow white so it's
really<00:00:22.289> really<00:00:22.470> important<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> power

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
really really important to get the power

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.349 
really really important to get the power
down<00:00:24.350> this<00:00:25.350> corner<00:00:25.680> because<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
down this corner because you have a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.040 
down this corner because you have a
really<00:00:27.660> long<00:00:27.810> strand<00:00:28.140> after<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.939> so

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
really long strand after this one so

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
really long strand after this one so
yeah<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.289> down<00:00:31.529> ill<00:00:31.830> -<00:00:32.520> oh<00:00:32.700> hush<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.239> just

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
yeah you are down ill - oh hush or just

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.290 
yeah you are down ill - oh hush or just
maybe<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:35.370> challenging<00:00:35.670> corner

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
maybe one of the more challenging corner

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.440 
maybe one of the more challenging corner
in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> world<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:38.010> flat<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> gt3<00:00:39.120> so

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
in the world is not flat with the gt3 so

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.830 
in the world is not flat with the gt3 so
it's<00:00:39.690> quite<00:00:40.559> challenging<00:00:41.520> corner<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.329> take

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
it's quite challenging corner to take

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.040 
it's quite challenging corner to take
really<00:00:43.200> white<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.750> really

really white and you have to be really

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.420 
really white and you have to be really
fast<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> corner<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
fast in that corner because you have a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
fast in that corner because you have a
really<00:00:47.820> long<00:00:48.030> straight<00:00:49.070> after<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.870> mister

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
really long straight after so if mister

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.490 
really long straight after so if mister
can<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.079> top<00:00:52.379> speed<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.800> lose<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> lot<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.610> time

can you top speed you lose a lot of time

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
can you top speed you lose a lot of time
first<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.430> coming<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> a

first are you you are coming up to a
white<00:00:57.840> left<00:00:58.410> why<00:00:59.280> lose<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> car<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:01.280> it's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
white left why lose a car bit here it's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.880 
white left why lose a car bit here it's
really<00:01:02.850> important<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.510> keep<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.650> the

left to take the right

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.380 
left to take the right
the<00:01:07.690> reason<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.050> state<00:01:08.260> here<00:01:08.670> coming<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.850> down

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
the reason the state here coming to down

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.750 
the reason the state here coming to down
hill<00:01:10.660> with<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.080> white<00:01:11.650> witch<00:01:12.130> really<00:01:12.310> important

to keep it really really tight coming to
too<00:01:16.900> much<00:01:17.080> white<00:01:17.290> head<00:01:17.500> with<00:01:17.680> this<00:01:17.770> time<00:01:18.040> we've

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
too much white head with this time we've

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.100 
too much white head with this time we've
seen<00:01:19.210> mistaken<00:01:19.900> beerus<00:01:20.260> traction<00:01:20.730> again

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110

downhill<00:01:23.280> left<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.610> really<00:01:25.030> important<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.480> get

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
downhill left is really important to get

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.110 
downhill left is really important to get
the<00:01:25.750> proton<00:01:26.110> with<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.410> straight<00:01:26.740> after<00:01:27.120> and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
the proton with the straight after and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.050 
the proton with the straight after and
we<00:01:28.270> are<00:01:28.390> now<00:01:28.630> coming<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.050> cool<00:01:29.880> double<00:01:30.880> left

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
we are now coming to cool double left

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.450 
we are now coming to cool double left
which<00:01:31.570> really<00:01:31.810> important<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.530> get<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.220> power

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
which really important to get the power

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.670 
which really important to get the power
down<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:34.390> soon<00:01:34.600> as<00:01:34.690> possible

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
down as soon as possible

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.670 
down as soon as possible
it's<00:01:36.280> really<00:01:36.910> hard<00:01:37.210> but<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.080> begin<00:01:38.290> to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
it's really hard but you begin to

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.070 
it's really hard but you begin to
practice<00:01:38.830> because<00:01:39.210> without<00:01:40.210> tires<00:01:40.510> but<00:01:40.780> quite

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
practice because without tires but quite

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.640 
practice because without tires but quite
hard<00:01:41.320> with<00:01:41.979> understeer<00:01:42.450> now<00:01:43.450> we<00:01:43.510> have<00:01:43.750> wide

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
hard with understeer now we have wide

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.469 
hard with understeer now we have wide
left<00:01:44.979> where<00:01:45.520> I<00:01:45.610> lose<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.510> car<00:01:46.720> here<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:47.110> bit

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
left where I lose the car here a bit

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.920 
left where I lose the car here a bit
which<00:01:49.479> really<00:01:50.290> no<00:01:50.560> nothing<00:01:51.100> really<00:01:51.220> special

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
which really no nothing really special

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710

it's<00:01:52.930> quite<00:01:53.170> nice<00:01:53.440> phone<00:01:53.830> actually<00:01:54.220> and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it's quite nice phone actually and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.840 
it's quite nice phone actually and
coming<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.900> another<00:01:56.200> white<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.680> lose<00:01:57.580> their

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
coming to another white I lose their

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.040 
coming to another white I lose their
pegs<00:01:58.060> again<00:01:58.240> because<00:01:59.020> brake<00:01:59.440> balance<00:02:01.050> there

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
pegs again because brake balance there

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.410 
pegs again because brake balance there
is<00:02:02.140> another<00:02:02.800> white<00:02:03.040> quite<00:02:03.700> fast<00:02:04.090> actually

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
is another white quite fast actually

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.660 
is another white quite fast actually
enforce<00:02:04.810> here<00:02:04.960> really<00:02:05.619> important<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.460> get<00:02:06.580> the

enforce here really important to get the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.490 
enforce here really important to get the
power<00:02:06.850> down<00:02:06.910> again<00:02:07.330> because<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:08.080> long<00:02:08.260> stride

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
power down again because a long stride

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.670 
power down again because a long stride
is<00:02:08.649> quite<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:10.360> main<00:02:10.630> thing<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:11.200> last
