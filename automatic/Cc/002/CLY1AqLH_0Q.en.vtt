00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.360
 but to all and come a new from 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.760
 channel I am mk2 and as always having 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.620
 I bring you one of the people to invite you to 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.450
 a dynamic for launch 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.820
 World of gears of war ultimate edition 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.890
 for the Latino community by the 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.689
 study of the collision where we will have 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.449
 several official prizes during the 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.400
 next days in some dynamics and 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.470
 you will wonder what they are 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.539
 these dynamics the idea is to increase 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.429
 the union and presence of the community 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.169
 gears of war so they will have 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.480
 you tweet your story using the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.520
 hashtag I am a guide to be able 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.410
 participate the idea is that your tweets 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.180
 get the most retweets 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.670
 and favorites to be noticed without 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.980
 However, that will not be the factor to win 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.379
 since what is sought is creativity 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.269
 of the fans and thus be able to win one of the 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.579
 official prizes sponsored by the 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.160
 Cohesion study for the community 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.679
 latina, you can start tweeting 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.870

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.179
 of Monday is to say that they will have everything 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.249
 Saturday and all Sunday to count 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.950
 its history and be noticed in the 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.590
 software community later 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.760
 will do other similar dynamics where 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.050
 they can get prizes 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.630
 surprises from the hand of the great 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.550

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.490
 to realize the promotional art of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.290
 game of gears of war ultimate edition and 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.240
 this is not all since gears of war 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.680
 ultimate edition comes with everything and the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.470

 they still do not have the game people do not know 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.440
 worry because during the transition 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.180
 they will be doing trivia 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.970

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.560
