00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:02.320
 Let's talk 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.930
 only the scanners in Mexico and specifically 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.550
 how can we choose the best team 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.360
 we 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.320
 as long as 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.049
 we give a talk with a conference 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.900
 We hear this question as I can choose the best scanner 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.560
 and there are many answers suddenly there is someone who loved you and I know that the best 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.179
 is the one that covers more cars 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.999
 others say and do it that way by buying the cheapest 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.829
 others say that not the best scanner is the one that is the most powerful 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.300
 in the national market we have a variety 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.050
 of about 20 teams from 20 different brands 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.380
 what can we choose? 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.970
 to do diagnostic work on board vehicles with vehicles 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.449
 we 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.479
 better before depp know what each scanner does 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.930
 we have to answer 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.170
 I want a scanner or what do I need a scanner for? 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.570
 if I can answer this question I could more easily meet the objective 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.670
 d satisfy 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.000
 that need that I have 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.190
 for my scanner 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.420
 remember that the simpler the answer, the easier we can 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.980
 meet that goal 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 Think about it, you almost know, we're almost sure of it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080
 so is 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.560
 I want a scanner because nothing more than to have more use 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.400
 easier 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.720
 and fast 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.610
 more money in your pocket 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.060
 if both roll without more complications now that we know for quique a 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.800
 scanner an easy way 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.170
 Well, in an easy way 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.330
 let's see which one meets my goal 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.100
 this is the autumn cycle 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 of four times which are the engines that at the moment and currently 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.910
 They're working 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.660
 we have the first cycle admission compression force or exhaust 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.240
 force soon and escape are the four cycles that the engine has that has not 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.200
 changed has more than 100 years that this motors is using what has 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.840
 changed is the way 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.929
 it is 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:55.999
 controlling 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.810
 from polluting emissions to 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.700
 percent the fuel efficiency and many other things going by in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.430
 medium 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.130
 this is because pollution like this photo that we have here takes 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.210
 of the Latin actor 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.930
 from the city of mexico and from many parts of the world every time it is increasing 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.260
 and the need to decrease it is also increasing 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.489
 we said that the engine and its combustion cycles 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.459
 is it so 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.419
 percent for more than 100 years existing 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.979
 but here is something an important point that we have to understand 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.039
 the electronic part of the engine what has been changing and keeps changing 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.879
 we have of the doctor dressed a universe of sensors 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.599
 we have the position sensor to be the author we have two sensors what as their 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.469
 name indicates 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.619
 they will give us 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:48.849
 information or they will send information to the computer these sensors all 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.319
 what has to do with sensors send signals 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.030
 voltage signals 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.390
 towards the computer the computer with this information what it is going to do is 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.909
 process it according to some tasks cobos margins that has 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.099
 of operation 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.700
 and what moves within its maximum and within its minimum 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.770
 is what is going 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.790
 to behave like normal 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.190
 with that information the computer i sends information to its actuators 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.889
 a gas pump 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.270
 one coil one spark plug one injector 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.020
 everything that has to do with the poor leadership of part the component 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.080
 electronic to the computer 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.439
 is what we are going to call actuators our scanner 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.689
 inside 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.360
 The only thing the vehicle will do is connect to the computer 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.209
 read the computer in your memory 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.810
 i what the computer has saved as a reading outside of a range 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.270
 maximum in minimum 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.720
 normal operation 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.299
 what we have within those values ​​outside 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.470
 of this range 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.410
 is what is going to save as a fault code and that is the only thing that is going to 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.609
 do the scanner 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.729
 the actuators at this moment we have 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.309
 so many advantages to be able to diagnose them even though that all 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.800
 indirectly 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.780
 because the actuator by not sending information to the computer is not 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.440
 return information 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.209
 we have no way of knowing if he is behaving 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.319
 or is not behaving as we expect today many vehicles have 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.680
 included more sensors to be monitoring the actuators 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.969
 but until 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.790
 let's have the certainty 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.290
 vicky lic these electronic components can increasingly be more 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.390
 accessible 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.629
 to all of us 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.080
 we are going to be able to make a diagnosis of actors with the scanner by the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.080
 moment is done indirectly 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.749
 nothing else 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.289
 acting or Peruvian it receives information from other sensors 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.020
 we also 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.159
 we talk about a normativity in the world the system 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.840
 workers 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.949
 what we will see 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:51.810
 in the next course
