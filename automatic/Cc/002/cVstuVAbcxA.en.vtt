00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.160
 hello everyone welcome to doctor chaos 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.880
 the in this video I will explain how 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.950
 you can record your life and many 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.410
 they will ask what need do I have of 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.980
 reset my life well it turns out that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.360
 many people make adjustments 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.669
 erroneous good to them they do not know they are 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.100
 wrong but when they turn on the board 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.680
 if you notice adjustments like change of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.440
 processor voltages settings like 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.199
 change the frequency of change them 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 in rbm of a fan and so on 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.280
 those configurations that to them in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.780
 principle seems good to you because when 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.769
 is done to watch clock or is done as 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.809
 a task of these you have to go 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.210
 testing until you realize 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.400
 that the task is correct well 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 it turns out that a lot of people do that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.820
 an error and then when you start the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 computer puts you there has been an error 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.900
 I do not know what and it does not work 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 clear to solve this kind of 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.409
 mistakes that you must make you must subtract the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.909
 bios many very modern plates already 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.340
 they incorporate the reset option 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.460
 automatic in certain starts the plate and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.680
 you can create it 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.290
 however not many manufacturers 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.540
 recommend that they use that option 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.940
 that sometimes does not reset 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.040
 completely the viola leaves such as 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.970
 It is factory leaves some other 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.479
 default setting but not reaching the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.240
 link to the point that today I also pass 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.619
 that very old computers change a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.950
 adjust for example the sequence of 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.420
 start you put him first for example if 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.670
 you want to format what you put for example 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.130
 the cdl reader first the hard drive 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.190
 of the second and so on then 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.740
 when they restart the computer it turns out 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.530
 that configuration has saved us 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 that false because the bios battery is 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.200
 has exhausted 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.460
 that happens when I speak to him very old and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.579
 It has many years then it is 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.280
 It is advisable to change it every X 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.690
 time I guess everyone will be given 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.000
 account when to ask me 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.880
 but normally it goes from two to two years 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.030
 this here is the pile of lips is what 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.120
 interesting to reset basically 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:26.540
 our our videos are usually 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.540
 Take out with a flat screwdriver you see 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.100
 put here is a little pressure and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.900
 this comes out you can also get out with the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.550
 finger without much difficulty simply 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.800
 we see the plate this and we take the stack 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.450
 It is highly recommended to wear gloves for 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.190
 do not contaminate the pile nonetheless and I 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.170
 I do not do it because I do not think it necessary 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.210
 but you please put the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.290
 gloves so they do not have any 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.170
 problem 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.880
 the plate must be completely 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.260
 disconnected the current is to say that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.880
 there must be an outlet 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 connected and takeshi the cable of 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.220
 current of your computer and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.260
 remove the row later but there are 10 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.260
 seconds and you reintroduce it 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.470
 in the case that for example you have 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.629
 spent the batteries because you have to 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.220
 to do is go to a watchmaker to a store 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.260
 from a supermarket and buy the pile there 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.489
 a normal button cell has no more 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.280
 patience after 40 is the plate to the 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.230
 current that you will have finished everything 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.090
 the process nothing will not need anything else 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.830
 since the bios will already be 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.690
 completely reset and will not have 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.890
 no other problems except everything 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.390
 that will like videos that have served 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.780
 help you already know for all this and a lot 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.069
 plus 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.069
 doctor carlos dotcom 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.359
 yes
