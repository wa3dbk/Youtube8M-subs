needs<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.959> deep<00:02:10.800> understanding<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.819> spawning

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
needs a deep understanding of spawning

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.490 
needs a deep understanding of spawning
mechanics<00:02:12.959> rather

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
mechanics rather

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.730 
mechanics rather
so<00:02:14.370> basically<00:02:14.870> these<00:02:15.870> guys<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.470> made<00:02:16.710> with

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
a few doors in order for these guys to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.240 
a few doors in order for these guys to
spawn<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.320> these<00:02:58.530> aren't<00:02:58.770> just<00:02:58.920> random

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
spawn so these aren't just random

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.030 
spawn so these aren't just random
passageways<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.390> Narnia<00:03:00.840> or<00:03:01.320> what<00:03:01.890> they<00:03:02.010> might

be oh haha I'll go check that out later
you<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.720> but<00:03:06.720> yeah<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.680> when<00:03:08.190> these<00:03:08.340> guys

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
you know but yeah so when these guys

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.699 
you know but yeah so when these guys
fall<00:03:09.000> down<00:03:09.330> they<00:03:09.600> sort<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.989> fall<00:03:10.290> out<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
fall down they sort of fall out the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.740 
fall down they sort of fall out the
radius<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.700> villagers<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.420> Moore<00:03:12.720> will

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
radius of the villagers so Moore will

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.720 
radius of the villagers so Moore will
spawn<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.790> basically<00:03:15.200> each<00:03:16.200> time<00:03:16.730> one

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
spawn in so basically each time one

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.090 
spawn in so basically each time one
falls<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.780> game<00:03:19.110> detects<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.799> there

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
falls and the game detects that there

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.120 
falls and the game detects that there
are<00:03:20.310> no<00:03:20.610> um<00:03:21.299> no<00:03:21.840> sex<00:03:22.350> animals<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.830> protect

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
are no um no sex animals to protect

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.250 
are no um no sex animals to protect
these<00:03:23.250> guys<00:03:23.610> they<00:03:24.269> will<00:03:24.420> spawn<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.870> one<00:03:25.049> more

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
these guys they will spawn in one more

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.650 
these guys they will spawn in one more
and<00:03:25.440> basically<00:03:25.709> these<00:03:25.980> guys<00:03:26.040> die<00:03:26.880> through

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
and basically these guys die through

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.330 
and basically these guys die through
lava<00:03:27.930> blades<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.620> reason<00:03:28.890> why<00:03:29.010> I've<00:03:29.130> lava

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
lava blades and the reason why I've lava

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.770 
lava blades and the reason why I've lava
blades<00:03:29.610> instead<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.030> drawing<00:03:30.209> them<00:03:30.510> is

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
blades instead of drawing them is

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.320 
blades instead of drawing them is
because<00:03:31.049> they<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.440> 50<00:03:31.980> fucking<00:03:32.400> arts<00:03:33.180> of

huh loser also you may be seeing that
there<00:04:18.390> are<00:04:18.419> some<00:04:18.600> missing<00:04:18.870> blocks<00:04:19.200> where

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
there are some missing blocks where

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.400 
there are some missing blocks where
water<00:04:19.979> don't<00:04:20.310> cover<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.930> that's<00:04:22.080> okay

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
water don't cover but that's okay

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.540 
water don't cover but that's okay
because<00:04:22.440> these<00:04:22.770> guys<00:04:22.979> are<00:04:23.039> too<00:04:23.310> wide<00:04:23.520> so

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
because these guys are too wide so

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.290 
because these guys are too wide so
they'll<00:04:23.910> lose<00:04:24.150> their<00:04:24.180> balance<00:04:24.450> event

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
they'll lose their balance event

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.469 
they'll lose their balance event
when<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.349> water<00:04:26.680> current<00:04:27.039> reaches<00:04:27.310> down<00:04:27.479> so

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
when the water current reaches down so

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.119 
when the water current reaches down so
that's<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:29.020> pretty<00:04:29.440> much<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.650> whole<00:04:29.919> thing
