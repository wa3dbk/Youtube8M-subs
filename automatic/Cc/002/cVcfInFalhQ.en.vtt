00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.660
Crazy bastards...

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380
"Building a memorial stone."

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.900
"Designating all victims as the rightful dead."

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.420
"A tax cut for the bereaved family"

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.880
When did we request that kind of things?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.220
Dad!

00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:49.474
Don’t pay attention to them if it’s not true.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.660
My princess!

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.260
Dad, why your arms so thin?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.540
It’s a muscle.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.440
I exercise these days.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.020
How are you doing?

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.993
I miss you but I’m fine.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.820
The place is so nice.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.620
Really?

00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:44.192
People pray for us a lot.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.280
Beautiful!

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.680
Dad, someone just prayed for me.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.920
What?

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.500
Oh, you can’t see it?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.600
Wait.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.300
What a nice people.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.640
They are.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.300
Dad, I’m getting prettier. How should I do? 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.680
You are. How should we do?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.700
Every time these people pray for me, I get items.

00:03:11.497 --> 00:03:13.657
Oh, and foreigners do it for me, too.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.800
Wait.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.600
They’re very kind.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.360
So you should cheer up, too.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.240
Okay, I will.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.400
Then I’ll see you again.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.360
See you.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.940
"Because our hope is so earnest."

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.880
