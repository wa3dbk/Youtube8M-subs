 Let's shoot the fair. 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.610

 You're a very nice guy. 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.730
 This is cool because success did not go up in his head he looks only if 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.370
 I was thinking of doing 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370

 does not seem to please the ladybug that talking is the board 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.790
 countering people 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.790

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.140
 It's about your work with the job. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.110
 at the same time as it is collective 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.540
 on the third the same mistake 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.820
 doing this novel is a very lonely job that when we come in 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.750
 home to see the result 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
