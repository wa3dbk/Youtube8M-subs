you launch the wizard the first thing
that<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.359> want<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.810> create<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.519> series

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that you want to do is create a series

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.150 
that you want to do is create a series
of<00:00:29.580> slides<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.740> make<00:00:31.890> sure<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
of slides I like to make sure that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.920 
of slides I like to make sure that
they're<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.340> sized<00:00:32.790> appropriately<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
they're all sized appropriately for the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.510 
they're all sized appropriately for the
for<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> viewing<00:00:34.680> size<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.219> I'm<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
for the viewing size that I'm going to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.030 
for the viewing size that I'm going to
set<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.090> website<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.649> always<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
set up on my website and it's always a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.410 
set up on my website and it's always a
good<00:00:38.219> idea<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.520> number<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.000> sequentially

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
good idea to number them sequentially

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.510 
good idea to number them sequentially
because<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.829> load<00:00:41.040> them<00:00:41.129> into<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
because then when you load them into the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310 
because then when you load them into the
wizard<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.910> don't<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> reorder<00:00:43.110> them

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
wizard you don't have to reorder them

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
wizard you don't have to reorder them
and<00:00:43.530> make<00:00:44.070> sure<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> order

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and make sure that you have the order

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
and make sure that you have the order
correct<00:00:45.329> every<00:00:45.600> time<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
correct every time that you that you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.279 
correct every time that you that you
execute<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.180> wizard<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.899> correct

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
execute there is the wizard to correct

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
execute there is the wizard to correct

again for my project I will typically
turn<00:01:59.610> them<00:01:59.820> off<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.450> don't<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.869> the

user to have have much control at this
point<00:02:04.290> I'm<00:02:04.619> about<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.070> save<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.549> slideshow

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
point I'm about to save the slideshow

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.690 
point I'm about to save the slideshow
and<00:02:06.329> it'll<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.810> done<00:02:07.190> for<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.220> intents<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and it'll be done for all intents and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.479 
and it'll be done for all intents and
purposes<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.929> good<00:02:10.110> idea<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.310> go

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
purposes so it's a good idea here to go

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.100

that's<00:04:25.030> all<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.360> take<00:04:25.569> all<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:25.990> all<00:04:26.439> that's

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
that's all the take all it all that's
