well it's about like seven degrees
outside<00:01:46.100> these<00:01:46.640> days<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.320> it's<00:01:48.320> not<00:01:48.560> as<00:01:48.710> bad<00:01:48.950> as

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
it was I think it's because the winds

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.750 
it was I think it's because the winds
dropped<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.410> bit<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:53.690> I<00:01:54.369> don't<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.550> need
