that<00:02:01.340> could<00:02:01.549> be<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> good<00:02:01.909> thing<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.479> was

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
that could be a good thing so it was

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.179 
that could be a good thing so it was
kind<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.110> two<00:02:03.290> minds<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.740> didn't<00:02:04.009> really

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
kind of in two minds and I didn't really

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.980 
kind of in two minds and I didn't really
know<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.490> think<00:02:04.579> when<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.630> came<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.899> the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
know what to think when it came to the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.020 
know what to think when it came to the
multiplayer<00:02:06.380> gameplay<00:02:06.710> session<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.549> had<00:02:08.000> a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
multiplayer gameplay session I had a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.190 
multiplayer gameplay session I had a
really<00:02:08.450> good<00:02:08.570> time<00:02:08.750> playing<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.079> multiplayer

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
really good time playing the multiplayer

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.289 
really good time playing the multiplayer
it<00:02:09.950> was<00:02:10.070> clear<00:02:10.399> there<00:02:10.579> were<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.729> lot<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.090> issues

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
it was clear there were a lot of issues

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.789 
it was clear there were a lot of issues
in<00:02:11.660> there<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.989> needed<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.260> be<00:02:12.320> worked<00:02:12.590> out

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
in there that needed to be worked out

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.490 
in there that needed to be worked out
but<00:02:12.860> we<00:02:13.220> were<00:02:13.400> playing<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.970> very<00:02:14.630> early<00:02:14.930> alpha

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
but we were playing a very early alpha

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.190 
but we were playing a very early alpha
stage<00:02:15.769> of<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.250> game<00:02:16.459> now<00:02:17.299> I<00:02:17.540> went<00:02:17.810> back<00:02:17.989> out

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
stage of the game now I went back out

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.780 
stage of the game now I went back out
there<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> month<00:02:18.709> later<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.340> played<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.610> game

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
there a month later and played the game

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.280 
there a month later and played the game
again<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.209> was<00:02:20.299> allowed<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.660> recall<00:02:20.959> footage

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
again and was allowed to recall footage

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.810 
again and was allowed to recall footage
and<00:02:21.440> bring<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.739> home<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:21.980> show<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.370> guys<00:02:22.610> on

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
and bring that home to show you guys on

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.030 
and bring that home to show you guys on
my<00:02:22.970> channel<00:02:23.329> now<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:23.959> got<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.380> very<00:02:24.680> mixed

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
my channel now I got a very mixed

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.280 
my channel now I got a very mixed
reaction<00:02:25.579> to<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.239> game<00:02:26.450> when<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.989> dropped

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
reaction to the game when it dropped

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.900 
reaction to the game when it dropped
onto<00:02:27.560> my<00:02:27.680> channel<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.160> lot<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.550> people<00:02:28.819> were

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
onto my channel a lot of people were

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.040 
onto my channel a lot of people were
saying<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.239> isn't<00:02:29.540> really<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.780> battlefield

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
saying this isn't really a battlefield

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.960 
saying this isn't really a battlefield
game<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.680> glorified<00:02:30.890> DLC

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
game it's just a glorified DLC

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.200 
game it's just a glorified DLC
or<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:33.260> could<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:34.280> game<00:02:34.610> without<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
or it could just be a game without the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.480 
or it could just be a game without the
word<00:02:35.510> battlefield<00:02:36.110> in<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.320> title<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.220> you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
word battlefield in the title and you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.220 
word battlefield in the title and you
know<00:02:37.610> what<00:02:37.820> I'd<00:02:38.180> have<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.390> agree<00:02:38.690> with<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.080> on

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
know what I'd have to agree with you on

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.380 
know what I'd have to agree with you on
first<00:02:39.800> sort<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.340> site<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:40.760> battlefield

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
first sort of site of battlefield

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.690 
first sort of site of battlefield
hardline<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:42.020> would<00:02:42.650> probably<00:02:42.830> agree<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.550> say

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
hardline I would probably agree and say

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.030 
hardline I would probably agree and say
that<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.000> could<00:02:44.270> actually<00:02:44.300> be<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:45.170> DLC<00:02:45.830> for

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
that this could actually be a DLC for

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.610 
that this could actually be a DLC for
Battlefield<00:02:46.100> 4<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.540> at<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.720> same<00:02:47.870> time<00:02:48.140> there

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
Battlefield 4 but at the same time there

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.990 
Battlefield 4 but at the same time there
are<00:02:48.650> lots<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.070> things<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.580> game<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:49.910> I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
are lots of things in the game that I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.210 
are lots of things in the game that I
think<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.480> make<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.900> far<00:02:51.170> more<00:02:51.410> than<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.650> DLC

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
think that make it far more than a DLC

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.880 
think that make it far more than a DLC
but<00:02:52.630> without<00:02:53.630> going<00:02:53.930> into<00:02:54.050> too<00:02:54.140> much<00:02:54.440> detail

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
but without going into too much detail

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.620 
but without going into too much detail
because<00:02:55.280> I'm<00:02:55.370> still<00:02:55.580> under<00:02:55.820> NDA<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:56.390> some<00:02:56.540> of

because I'm still under NDA for some of

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.030 
because I'm still under NDA for some of
these<00:02:56.720> things<00:02:56.780> because<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.320> know<00:02:57.470> more<00:02:57.860> than

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
these things because I know more than

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.070 
these things because I know more than
I'm<00:02:58.250> allowed<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.820> say<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.450> can't<00:02:59.810> go<00:02:59.930> much

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
I'm allowed to say so I can't go much

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.560 
I'm allowed to say so I can't go much
further<00:03:00.350> with<00:03:00.710> that<00:03:00.890> but<00:03:01.640> moving<00:03:02.030> further<00:03:02.210> on

further with that but moving further on

community can relate to as well this

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.480 
community can relate to as well this
game<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.870> going<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.260> be<00:03:33.350> make-or-break<00:03:33.950> for

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
game is going to be make-or-break for

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.980 
game is going to be make-or-break for
the<00:03:34.580> franchise<00:03:34.850> if<00:03:35.210> this<00:03:35.330> will<00:03:35.510> get<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.750> right

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
the franchise if this will get it right

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.080 
the franchise if this will get it right
they'll<00:03:36.620> have<00:03:36.860> another<00:03:37.190> bad<00:03:37.400> company<00:03:37.760> 2<00:03:37.940> on

they'll have another bad company 2 on
their<00:03:38.240> hands<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.600> think<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.959> will<00:03:39.050> go<00:03:39.230> down<00:03:39.410> as

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
their hands I think it will go down as

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.080 
their hands I think it will go down as
one<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.920> greatest<00:03:40.160> battlefield<00:03:40.730> games<00:03:40.940> in

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
one of the greatest battlefield games in

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.199 
one of the greatest battlefield games in
history<00:03:41.270> but<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.350> goes<00:03:42.440> wrong<00:03:42.790> then<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
history but if it goes wrong then the

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.210 
history but if it goes wrong then the
battlefield<00:03:44.720> community<00:03:45.230> may<00:03:45.410> actually<00:03:45.620> cease

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
battlefield community may actually cease

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.660 
battlefield community may actually cease
to<00:03:46.490> exist<00:03:47.320> I'm<00:03:48.320> pretty<00:03:48.620> confident<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.340> I'm

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
to exist I'm pretty confident and I'm

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.220 
to exist I'm pretty confident and I'm
probably<00:03:49.910> sure<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.600> lot<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.990> you<00:03:51.110> guys

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
probably sure that a lot of you guys

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.410 
probably sure that a lot of you guys
will<00:03:51.500> agree<00:03:51.620> with<00:03:51.890> me<00:03:52.070> that<00:03:52.100> if<00:03:52.580> this<00:03:53.180> game

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420

will agree with me that if this game
comes<00:03:53.720> out<00:03:53.900> broken<00:03:54.470> which<00:03:54.830> I<00:03:55.100> don't<00:03:55.340> think<00:03:55.520> it

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
comes out broken which I don't think it

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.940 
comes out broken which I don't think it

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
how things are going and they generally

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.710 
how things are going and they generally
seem<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.670> have<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.820> very<00:04:04.910> good<00:04:05.300> handle<00:04:05.600> on

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
seem to have a very good handle on

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.870 
seem to have a very good handle on
things<00:04:05.959> but<00:04:06.650> if<00:04:06.739> this<00:04:06.890> game<00:04:07.130> does<00:04:07.430> come<00:04:07.550> out

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
things but if this game does come out

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.229 
things but if this game does come out
and<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.480> not<00:04:08.590> working<00:04:09.590> as<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:10.070> should<00:04:10.100> do<00:04:10.520> it's

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
and is not working as it should do it's

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.050 
and is not working as it should do it's
not<00:04:11.570> fully<00:04:11.930> functional<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:13.250> not<00:04:13.580> what<00:04:13.910> the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
not fully functional it's not what the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.020 
not fully functional it's not what the
battlefield<00:04:14.570> community<00:04:14.750> might<00:04:15.230> consider<00:04:15.680> as

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
battlefield community might consider as

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.370 
battlefield community might consider as
different<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.150> apart<00:04:17.330> from<00:04:17.690> battlefield<00:04:18.320> 4

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
different and apart from battlefield 4

different and apart from battlefield 4
and<00:04:18.709> 3<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:19.970> as<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.419> said<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.870> don't<00:04:21.049> think<00:04:21.380> the

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.650 
the beta well a majority if you played
the<00:05:08.320> beta<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:09.639> a<00:05:09.759> lot<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.030> people<00:05:10.330> gave<00:05:10.479> some

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
the beta and a lot of people gave some

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.600 
the beta and a lot of people gave some
really<00:05:10.840> good<00:05:11.110> feedback<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.340> fact<00:05:12.550> that

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
really good feedback and the fact that

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.950 
really good feedback and the fact that
they've<00:05:12.789> delayed<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.300> game<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.600> take<00:05:13.780> that

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
they've delayed the game to take that

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.740 
they've delayed the game to take that
feedback<00:05:14.350> on<00:05:14.530> is<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.800> brilliant<00:05:15.490> step<00:05:15.789> but<00:05:16.479> as<00:05:16.600> I

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
feedback on is a brilliant step but as I

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.600 
feedback on is a brilliant step but as I
say<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.229> will<00:05:17.380> make<00:05:17.530> absolutely<00:05:18.400> no

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
say it will make absolutely no

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.060 
say it will make absolutely no
difference<00:05:18.789> if<00:05:19.539> this<00:05:20.050> game<00:05:20.350> does<00:05:20.620> not<00:05:20.650> come

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
difference if this game does not come

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.150 
difference if this game does not come
out<00:05:21.250> fully<00:05:21.550> functional<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.210> working<00:05:22.600> I

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
out fully functional and working I

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.650 
out fully functional and working I
really<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.340> truly<00:05:24.370> hope<00:05:24.970> that<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.270> lot<00:05:25.570> of

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
really and truly hope that a lot of

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.570 
really and truly hope that a lot of
people<00:05:26.050> that<00:05:26.260> have<00:05:26.440> left<00:05:26.740> battlefield<00:05:27.370> 4

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
people that have left battlefield 4

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.580 
people that have left battlefield 4
simply<00:05:27.970> because<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.660> way<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.139> came<00:05:29.350> out

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
simply because the way that it came out

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.230 
simply because the way that it came out
and<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.190> fact<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.580> didn't<00:05:30.880> live<00:05:31.060> up<00:05:31.090> to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
and the fact that it didn't live up to

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.870 
and the fact that it didn't live up to
its<00:05:31.539> name<00:05:31.680> will<00:05:32.680> come<00:05:32.710> back<00:05:33.220> with<00:05:33.550> battlefield

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
its name will come back with battlefield

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.879 
its name will come back with battlefield
hardline<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.449> will<00:05:34.720> give<00:05:34.900> it<00:05:34.930> a<00:05:35.110> go<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.530> lot<00:05:35.800> of
