00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
fly-by-wire a very long time since way

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.030 
fly-by-wire a very long time since way
before<00:04:05.210> Nissan<00:04:05.960> started<00:04:06.440> playing<00:04:06.830> with<00:04:06.980> it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
before Nissan started playing with it

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.390 
before Nissan started playing with it
why<00:04:07.730> did<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.150> take<00:04:08.360> ten<00:04:08.750> years<00:04:09.080> well<00:04:10.070> Chuck<00:04:10.280> I

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
why did it take ten years well Chuck I

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.100 
why did it take ten years well Chuck I
guess<00:04:10.580> we've<00:04:10.790> got<00:04:10.820> to<00:04:11.090> ask<00:04:11.240> how<00:04:11.690> long<00:04:11.870> did<00:04:12.080> it

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
guess we've got to ask how long did it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.100 
guess we've got to ask how long did it
take<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.530> aircraft<00:04:13.100> industry<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:13.910> develop

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
achieve clean air standards is that

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.500 
achieve clean air standards is that

in<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.870> than<00:05:15.050> gasoline<00:05:15.290> so<00:05:16.040> it<00:05:16.190> burns<00:05:16.400> cleaner

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
in it than gasoline so it burns cleaner

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.050

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
obviously the particulate is not smog if

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.140 
obviously the particulate is not smog if

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.200 
in Europe see wolf has a question about
hydraulic<00:06:24.590> hybrids<00:06:25.130> like<00:06:25.340> the<00:06:25.670> one<00:06:25.820> that<00:06:25.970> Cujo

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
hydraulic hybrids like the one that Cujo

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.920 
hydraulic hybrids like the one that Cujo
says<00:06:26.690> it<00:06:26.990> will<00:06:27.110> have<00:06:27.320> ready<00:06:27.560> in<00:06:27.710> 2015<00:06:28.640> I<00:06:28.970> wonder

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
says it will have ready in 2015 I wonder

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.630 
says it will have ready in 2015 I wonder
how<00:06:30.050> many<00:06:30.110> stops<00:06:30.590> have<00:06:30.950> to<00:06:31.130> be<00:06:31.220> made<00:06:31.430> before

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
how many stops have to be made before

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.580 
how many stops have to be made before

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
the cylinder is charged for maximum

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.030 
the cylinder is charged for maximum
efficiency<00:06:34.280> on<00:06:34.850> hydraulic<00:06:35.660> hybrids<00:06:36.200> for<00:06:36.950> now

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
efficiency on hydraulic hybrids for now

hybrid<00:06:43.700> will<00:06:44.210> act<00:06:44.480> like<00:06:44.900> an<00:06:45.020> electric<00:06:45.530> hybrid

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
hybrid will act like an electric hybrid

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.010 
hybrid will act like an electric hybrid
in<00:06:46.040> that<00:06:46.250> the<00:06:46.790> engine<00:06:46.970> will<00:06:47.419> be<00:06:47.570> used<00:06:47.840> to

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
in that the engine will be used to

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.290 
in that the engine will be used to
charge<00:06:48.230> up<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:48.680> hydraulic<00:06:49.220> pressure<00:06:49.520> just<00:06:50.060> as

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
charge up the hydraulic pressure just as

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.360 
charge up the hydraulic pressure just as
it<00:06:50.419> charges<00:06:50.600> up<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:51.020> battery<00:06:51.169> in<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.919> hybrid

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
it charges up the battery in a hybrid

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.060 
it charges up the battery in a hybrid
even<00:06:52.910> so<00:06:53.120> most<00:06:53.840> of<00:06:54.050> the<00:06:54.200> charging<00:06:54.650> will<00:06:54.800> still

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
even so most of the charging will still

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.750 
even so most of the charging will still
come<00:06:55.340> from<00:06:55.640> capturing<00:06:56.150> braking<00:06:57.080> energy<00:06:57.760> hey

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
come from capturing braking energy hey

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.310 
come from capturing braking energy hey
