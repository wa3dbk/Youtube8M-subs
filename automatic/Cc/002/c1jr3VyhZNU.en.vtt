00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.730
 open world superhero games already 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.380
 have become something of a separate genre all 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.090
 know the same prototype 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.340
 infamous for playstation and a little less 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.949
 famous crackdown for x-box 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.000
 but there was no more punk playing than 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.000
 sunset overdrive 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.290
 sunset overdrive looks like tony 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 hawk's american wasteland is played as 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.510
 karoch is clients on steroids and monster 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.700
 it reminds you of some enemies 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.739
 resistance is not surprising because 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 2 last games done just the same in 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.690
 dream book but they also added a pinch of thrash 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.309
 in the spirit of the toxic avenger imagine 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 imagine the near future where one 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 the corporation is engaged in absolutely all 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.690
 industries in the city and run 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.610
 free sale of soda which 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.790
 purely by chance doing everything from 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:08.580
 in charge of unflattering mutants and who 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:11.910
 did it come up with you or you bummer people on 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
 massager mouth forums but the bottom line is that 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.530
 the game is in the know that they threw a whole into it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.570
 wagon stamps and crazy ideas she herself 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.660
 laughs at himself and the player is already trying 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.259
 laughing with her goes sunset 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.830
 overdrive 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.320
 clown but very intelligent clown chief 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.060
 the hero is just a janitor and killer fish 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.100
 a loser who is happy 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.039
 accidents didn’t bother a new drink and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.209
 remained one of the survivors after 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.229
 energetic until lipsey with 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:42.360
 Yes, perhaps you need to patent the word 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.209
 Hello, no superpowers 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.550
 gg does not have but jumps and runs on 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.100
 walls in defiance of all my building 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.259
 physics and slips along the wires and everything 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.209
 anything like jet set radio 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.819
 no one explains that even 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.310
 here it is so accepted the main task of the hero 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.470
 becomes an escape from sunset city but immediately 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.259
 we have obstacles 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.319
 hordes of mutant mercenaries robots and 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.860
 lack of common sense among screenwriters 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.930
 again here it is ok in san city 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.970
 left small groups of survivors they 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.860
 give us tasks and we press a couple 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.670
 buttons to effectively get to 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.290
 right place 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.410
 do something stupid there and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.750
 return in general this is no one 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.640
 surprise the hero often on assignment or 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.700
 just for fan breaks skulls 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.280
 the enemies of azat but also the fourth wall between 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.860
 they are a player and here it is impossible not to notice 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.200
 that dialogs in sunset overdrive are asking 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.959
 mood literally from the first minute 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.970
 they can not be allowed in the museum recall that 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.830
 you're in a museum they immediately disappear hunt 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.540
 go inside besides fun 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.340
 parts developers took care of 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.410
 to make it fun to play 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.930
 time and the game itself did not have time to get bored 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.180
 earlier than end at first glance 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.099
 everything is simple in the form of shooting have fun 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.989
 but beyond that there are plenty of others 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.780
 For example, four types of currency 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.910
 butts energetic badges and colleagues tables 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.959
 for money you can buy yourself clothes 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.549
 of which there is not that much but extremely 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.709
 authentic synergist can be bought 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.750
 new weapon and unlock location 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.000
 collecta was just behind that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.829
 can i buy new skills 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.690
 and for the icons you can pump 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.660
 extra stats for your weapon 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.420
 or the style of the game to get them is easy to 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.610
 just play and they will roll in 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.420
 as a kind of analogy awesome aw plus 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.380
 each weapon can be improved the longer 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.030
 do you have fun with your favorite trunk 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.780
 you are faster to wait for him to level five 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:45.260
 in general with rpk elements here everything is 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.260
 okay, I'm calling you an ex head 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.019
 so you 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.790
 story campaign takes 10 hours 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.370
 but besides her there is something to do 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.269
 for example the same colleagues tables here them 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.360
 just do not count 150 years on the wires 150 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.540
 cameras that need to shoot down 150 balloons 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.360
 craving close close contact 150 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.290
 graphic signage 150 toilet paper 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.530
 on lanterns and there is more 40 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.510
 phone backpacks and graffiti and rather 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.269
 just forgot something 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.760
 collect almost 1000 units and this 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.770
 will take not so little time if not 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.840
 like to collect all sorts of junk that is 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.330
 chellendzhi and if you want something more 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.880
 interesting that is something like protection 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.050
 of the fort and of course you can scare 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.180
 multiplayer 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.340
 cartoon here is more like a compilation 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.560
 events modes are not very much but for 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.870
 of a similar game they are more than obvious all 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.090
 same as in single but with partners 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.830
 finished matches run take quest on 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.900
 the next one can even move around who 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.210
 faster but this is purely for 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.210
 confirmation of its own magnificence 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.530
 sunset overdrive is nice 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.320
 entertainment for xbox one and 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.180
 real punk rock in the world of video games but 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.560
 yet this is not the president for the sake of 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.650
 who should run to the store for 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.110
 console at least because for hours 15 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.270
 games you will discover absolutely everything and do 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.400
 the game will have nothing to return to 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.770
 incredibly not want but desire 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.870
 see the sequel still left it 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.510
 it was a lot of fun 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.850
 good student comedies like crazy 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.340
 Loyd Kaufman's best films cheerfully like 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.380
 almost all superhero games but 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.690
 at least in this game we will 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.970
 should die as often as possible because 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.560
 what the developers tried and did 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.560
 very cool spawn 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.490
 It’s definitely worth playing sunset overdrive 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.980
 especially if you have the right console 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.160
 because it is really stylish 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.010
 fashionable and youth but as for me 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.840
 it was all bass and of course to new 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.840
 bye for now
