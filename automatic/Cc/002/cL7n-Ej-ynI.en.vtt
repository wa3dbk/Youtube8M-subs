 Fashion of course is necessary for installation 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.399

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.720
 after which we close it with us 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.369
 appears in the minecraft folder 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.649
 appears daddies but you can and 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 automatically go better and close 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.619
 micro to go to the folder 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.590
 mycroft some she is not we 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:09.600
 we register in search of windows 7 percent and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.799
 ap Dart percentage here and so we go in 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.209
 rum bow 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:20.230
 . minecraft and everything further we go into 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.799
 mods folder here I downloaded this mod let's 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.799

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:39.299
 not really loading sorry guys i 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:43.329
 Just like that extract so I learned 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.599
 we drag in mods here everything 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.980
 it is fine now we go when we go in 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.439
 mikroft now and by the way i forgot 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.560
 mention you when when you 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:58.840
 set the forge you poke on the profile and 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.889
 poke at a solid to a Ford or 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 change in the version that is two times and not 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.099
 skip version not put the last one 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.010
 you should be worth it 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:15.790
 175 already see put scroll down and 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.919
 choose a forge safe to the feast forge 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.599
 ok let's see from the idea we have 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:28.349
 should have become a parachute mod 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.349
 so loaded 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.519

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.180
 optifine 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.579
 yes here he is a parachute mod working that is 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.500
 all I installed the mod on mairaft exactly 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.489
 also done on any other version 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.680
