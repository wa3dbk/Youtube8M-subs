on these cars the way the lines flow the
openness<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.290> we're

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
openness and this is all because we're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.190 
openness and this is all because we're
celebrating<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.129> technology<00:00:44.700> well<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.390> the

celebrating the technology well the the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.290 
celebrating the technology well the the
AIA<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> great<00:00:46.920> example<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
AIA is a great example of what the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770 
AIA is a great example of what the
carbon<00:00:48.600> fiber<00:00:48.809> offers<00:00:49.530> us<00:00:50.420> normally<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.570> have

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
carbon fiber offers us normally you have

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.040 
carbon fiber offers us normally you have
in<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.289> car<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> middle<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.940> B<00:00:54.149> pillar<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
in a car in the middle a B pillar it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
in a car in the middle a B pillar it
sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> separates<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> car<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.489> half<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
sort of separates the car in half and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
sort of separates the car in half and
because<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> strength<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.800> carbon

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
because of the strength of the carbon

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
because of the strength of the carbon
fiber<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.210> we've<00:01:00.449> made<00:01:00.629> an<00:01:00.750> open<00:01:01.170> frame

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
fiber it's just we've made an open frame

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280 
fiber it's just we've made an open frame
this<00:01:02.280> open<00:01:02.670> frame<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> design

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this open frame is it because you design

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
this open frame is it because you design
freedom<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:05.549> gives<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
freedom you can and also gives you the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
freedom you can and also gives you the
possibility<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.340> much<00:01:08.490> easier

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
possibility to use it in a much easier

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.160 
possibility to use it in a much easier
way<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> city<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
way in the city you're going to want to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
way in the city you're going to want to
be<00:01:10.290> able<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.439> transition<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.400> very

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
be able to transition in and out very

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.789 
be able to transition in and out very
quickly<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.689> carbon<00:01:13.020> fiber<00:01:13.200> offers<00:01:13.710> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
quickly and the carbon fiber offers that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.219 
quickly and the carbon fiber offers that
to<00:01:13.979> us<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.000> interior<00:01:15.420> design

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to us from the interior design

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.840 
to us from the interior design
standpoint<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.159> course<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.670> these

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
standpoint of course you have these

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
standpoint of course you have these
coach<00:01:18.659> doors<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.259> open<00:01:19.619> towards<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
coach doors they open towards you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
coach doors they open towards you
they<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.180> invite<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> into<00:01:21.780> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
they really invite you into this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.140 
they really invite you into this
generous<00:01:22.530> amount<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> space<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
generous amount of space and because of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.410 
generous amount of space and because of
the<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.960> packaging<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.670> floor<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.180> flat

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the the packaging the the floor is flat

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
the the packaging the the floor is flat
you<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> tunnel<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.490> bisects<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you do not have a tunnel that bisects it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
you do not have a tunnel that bisects it
so<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.720> able<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.079> flow<00:01:32.009> across<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.900> car

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so you're able to flow across the car

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
so you're able to flow across the car
from<00:01:34.290> either<00:01:34.470> side<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.280> enter<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.270> exit

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
from either side and to enter or exit

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.460 
from either side and to enter or exit
from<00:01:36.869> either<00:01:37.020> side<00:01:37.140> very<00:01:37.850> smoothly<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.320> ate<00:01:40.320> as

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
from either side very smoothly I ate as

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.460 
from either side very smoothly I ate as
well<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.950> large<00:01:41.270> door<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
well you have a large door and the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
well you have a large door and the
carbon<00:01:43.799> fiber<00:01:44.090> stability<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> durability

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
carbon fiber stability the durability

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
carbon fiber stability the durability
allows<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.530> open<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.070> door<00:01:47.100> from<00:01:47.850> two

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
allows you to open the door from two

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.210 
allows you to open the door from two
very<00:01:48.119> small<00:01:48.630> hinges<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.710> large<00:01:49.950> door

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
very small hinges and this large door

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
very small hinges and this large door
gives<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> large<00:01:50.939> opening<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> can

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
gives you a large opening so you can

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
gives you a large opening so you can
also<00:01:52.380> transition<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.820> you're

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
also transition in and out as you're

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.890 
also transition in and out as you're
entering<00:01:55.079> and
