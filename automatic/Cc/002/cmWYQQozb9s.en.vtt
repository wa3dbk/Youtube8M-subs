00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.529
 our readers have that once again 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.089
 horse of the year for rider review 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.179
 chosen internationally 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.580
 this time won cellagon lambrasco 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.040
 the acting world and european champion 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 my colleagues have him and his 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.630
 rider janne friederike meyer in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.580
 dutch field near hamburg visited there 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.320
 you have seen like the top sport 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 Horse is in the meadow on the paddock 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.519
 allowed to roll and how casual it is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.310
 daily workload on the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.320
 riding course completed but before this day 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.920
 there was still the solemn tribute in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.120
 balve at the german championships 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.610
 in balve with the Germans 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 championships, he was called to the rider 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.550
 he of the year awarded cellagon 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.879
 lambrasco and here in schenefeld 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.070
 hamburg is his home 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.760
 this daily grazing every one of his 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.440
 brown girlfriend and feels and then 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.859
 would janne from his rider 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.140
 friederike meyer for his daily program 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.730
 picked that up for lambrasco 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.840
 It looks like it always works 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.939
 first in the guide and then 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.110
 is usually announced once riding 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.430
 make it pretty before and what we do 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.619
 also do that when your magnetic field 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.090
 hang up cover because he over it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.619
 feels quite comfortable then is a bit 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 Warm before work and then he goes 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.770
 mostly on the treadmill and or 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.750
 on the petto that a bit too 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.360
 Weather dependent paddock he finds right 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 well because he is always really hungry 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 and in the afternoon he either still leaves 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 times as a theological just around 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.759
 to be allowed to go out alone 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.430
 or go for a ride or go for a ride 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.439
 again, they are training properly 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.020
 often when I'm not there that's why 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.369
 in the gallop training he does when I'm with 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.500
 my other horses at the tournament 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.100
 I am then the program for mox 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.630
 largely the same, so that's it 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.790
 ensures that every day 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.009
 much employment has come out for 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.820
 he has his rest away from work every day 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.550
 but he will do something, so he is 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 no horse what was going on at the whole 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.819
 to be a box or he wants something 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.270
 company wants to be employed 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.950
 he knows 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.190
 that he is good and he wants it that way 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.760
 he has already felt the feeling 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:33.130
 that he is the star in the stall and that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:35.500
 you have to take care of him bayer already 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.710
 when I mean that a little belly you 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.720
 not tell but was quite 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.340
 beautiful brummer and somehow looked 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.930
 like such a little cute pug and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.050
 It is said that they stayed that way 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.300
 he is now no popstars right 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.510
 real tournament drives he is now like that 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.950
 at home that's the everyday thing there 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.540
 would be treated well though 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.880
 also have a bit of his series 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.620
 and at the tournament it starts 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.930
 yes really users a course comes 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.430
 he wants to load there is no jump again 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.110
 does not do that well that's always been 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.250
 a great privilege when driving 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.660
 does not have something 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:17.620
 I think I have a problem jumping them 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.459
 like high wide victims or have them 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.860
 in front of him 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:27.700
 charming it was so small because of me 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:30.580
 imagine it already I had not and 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.560
 is too unusual too 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.480
 my other horses were actually 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.840
 rather spacious as a classic 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.640
 holsteiner type woman offered her abbott ever so 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.860
 that all this is such a high 1 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.590
 could share and then just with a lot 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.290
 fortune has jumped and we 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.150
 originally have him as a pete 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.459
 get that was actually one 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.010
 others are riding a lot faster 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.600
 Frequency galloping and at the time 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.600
 I did not expect that 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.860
 Let's create such a difficult course 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.990
 but it actually felt with him 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.070
 always everything relatively easy and 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.990
 fleet-footed 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.250
 i've been on hooge i thought 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.830
 that we can do now maybe 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.590
 but not always, and once took a 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.420
 course he has always given everything 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.470
 and there are always little mistakes 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.730
 losgeflogen 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.100
 So we worked slowly up 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.150
 to the 1 win at the big price of aachen 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.860
 2000 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.460
 or the team gold at the 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.250
 World Equestrian Games in lexington 2010 the 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.970
 the first of the first was the so watch for 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.470
 we understood each other immediately and 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.199
 Anja are a small parcours sample 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.150
 ridden and I really do not have 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.669
 So Yoga can jump 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.830
 it does not feel like it does 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.250
 the man after riding but I knew 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.620
 that we from our trip yes from his 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.639
 he likes to be ridden a lot 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.919
 fit well and yes that too 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.620
 feeling in the jump will be quick jump 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.919
 running was based off the merry has since 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.990
 me exactly what we have fun together 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.710
 also like today in easy training without 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.930
 jumps 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.690
 because next to obstacles like lambrasco 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.810
 also something else especially 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.820
 prefer to eat so 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.169
 In any case, that will come soon 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.000
 maybe three times in a row 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.720
 only two times and then jump 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.780
 so eat it very far ahead and even 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.180
 do not wait there and music so wait 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.430
 long because it is an abomination for him 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.930
 must stand somewhere that that 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.270
 is not good that you can see now 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.949
 beautiful 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.349
 and if then there is music to it then 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:41.710
 there is no stopping him there he is gone 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:45.250
 seen or without mia damn it 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.760
 is ever with all the Lambrasco 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.249
 off a steep career with and fog 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.339
 Janne-Friederike 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.339
 meyer
