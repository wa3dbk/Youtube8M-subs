00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.600
 hi friends today we are going to make some rich 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.500
 homemade cookies I tell you 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.860
 ingredients here we have 500 grams of 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.570
 flour loosens normal flour loose 200 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.420
 grams of whole wheat flour 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.340
 We have two spoons of grated 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.010
 lemon is the full lemon that we have 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.460
 frozen and then grate 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.320
 apart we also have 200 grams of 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.500
 cane sugar 3 eggs 125 grams of 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.960
 soft olive oil and a spoonful of 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.690
 baking soda with all these ingredients 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.870
 let's do our great 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 homemade cookies 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.880
 first of all let's mix 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.880
 the sugar we have here 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.530
 Oil 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.510
 and the three forums 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 this is going to mix well 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.520
 and before adding the areas 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.620
 or 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.350
 we have it well mixed now we add 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.350
 the integrated 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.740
 there we have all 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.740
 the tablespoon of baking 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.840
 the other flour this is loose flour from 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.840
 the normal one that we use at home 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.100
 there we have everything 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.000
 and finally the scratch of it 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.780
 of the skin of lemon good skin and the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.480
 lemon meat also sense 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.180
 and now we only have to mix it 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.300
 all right 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.720
 until we make a paste 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.720
 with which we will make our cookies 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.480
 Well now we have kneaded the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.760
 we have taken off the flight and we have 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.120
 advanced on the table because as you see 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.750
 there is a rather hard consistency 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.130
 You see when putting your finger you have to save 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.130
 you have to save the forms 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.490
 Now we're going to let him rest 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.500
 a little and like that while we collect all 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.330
 the kitchen tackle and we're going 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.990
 feeling a bit we'll leave it a half 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.710
 hour or more so I rest 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.710
 here it is 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.960
 we are already stretching the mass we have 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.020
 put some oil on the table some 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.240
 drops of oil 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.810
 so that we are not asked for the mass and 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.950
 much easier to work it now let's 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.960
 go extending and we're going to give him the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.420
 thickness we want we can make them 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.760
 thicker more skinny like us 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.880
 but let's go 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.190
 once we have extended 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.890
 we will take the cutters as those who 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.280
 you have by house or that you do not have then 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.370
 with a knife a green plan and a 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.090
 Once we have them we will be doing 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.090
 the forms 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.550
 if you see 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.880
 we will be withdrawing 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.940
 the surplus excess of the dough 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.550
 we would knead 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.350
 and Aguascalientes we will pass them to the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.210
 Baking tray 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.730
 on the baking sheet with parchment paper 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.740
 baking and we continue placing there to 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.950
 when they are all ready to put them 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.950
 other 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.200
 here we go with the second tray already 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.030
 we have completed a baking tray and 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.220
 now with different molds that we had 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.500
 we are doing different figures 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.150
 and for not making our base equal we're going 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.639
 to complete that more or less will be filled 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.409
 this tray about this recipe is 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.360
 for two audio trays 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:38.039
 we are going to complete it now and when 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.039
 let's have the oven 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.750
 we just took the cookies out of the oven 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.820
 and now therefore important we are going to 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.550
 leave here on the tray to cool 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.860
 well before you leave thumb the because 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.930
 maybe now it would break us 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.940
 let's wait for them to cool and then 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.150
 We present them on a plate or in a 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.150
 source 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:06.569
 good friends and here we have our 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:09.479
 cookies you see this source is all the 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.100
 amount that has come out with this 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.820
 recipe 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.660
 and as you see the 15 at first I used 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.480
 a big mold you see a big cutter 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.480
 and look I'm going to start one so you can see 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:31.150

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.289

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:39.759
 breakfast in the afternoon with a coffee 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:42.749

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:46.589
 You can do any way that 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:50.860
 you want different molds 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:53.190
 cutters you can give the dough the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.090
 way you want 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.090
