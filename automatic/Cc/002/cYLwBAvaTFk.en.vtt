00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.580

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.829
 onion it will take from the bottom of your gifts that 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.720

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.460
 veal stock for half a liter of water 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:30.249
 coriander or coriander seeds 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.829
 in powder and finally veal this is the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.820
 moment that 's wrong so you have to ask 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.160
 of the veal blanquette 1 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.380
 Well here we begin immediately 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 our recipe by heating up a 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.030
 tablespoon of olive oil 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.070
 here we are going to get them back our 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.070
 meat 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 then you must be watch clips 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.220
 put nice pieces of meat that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.640
 want to keep the good bits seems 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.330
 so we brown our meat on the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 fire for five minutes and then we 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.979
 will put the meat once she 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.299
 will be gilded we go there reserved and we will 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.420
 take care of the carrots 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.000
 so that's our meat started to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.630
 well gilded then we will do like 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.880
 arabia approving the onions and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.010
 slice the onion 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.010
 [Music] 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.950
 Come on, that's all it continues to write 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.340
 so what 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.289
 finally 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.939
 now it will take so if you have 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.609
 of the body is within powder is 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:57.560
 perfect if you have it in grains like 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:57.560
 I need to grind it 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.860
 there is a height that emerges it's 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.160
 great even though the dry seeds that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.190
 is really a great smell so here it is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.959
 after a kindly teaspoon 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.860
 and we'll put that right away on the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:26.660
 meat so that it testifies well to a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:26.660
 dress of this type we could also see 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.820
 the strikes 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.560
 for devaux so what happens is 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.150
 we boil we will do we will 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.810
 bring to you make half a liter 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.380
 of water with three good spoon 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.520
 veal background coffee if you do not have 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.000
 of veal stock you can very well 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:03:00.380
 use a cubic broth 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:03.260
 so here's flee 2 and 3 and so we go 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.650
 [Music] 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.440
 emissions 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.030
 [Music] 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.020
 which will help us cook allowed 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.710
 to take off our picture right away 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.540
 so here we are going to book our 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:24.240
 beautiful pieces and we will result so 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:32.000
 onions the carrots that we caused 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:37.800
 a transfer by throwing a little bit 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.320
 return the carrots and at the end of us 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.530
 two minutes we will add our job 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.610
 believe two sons-in-law here applied 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.760
 to start the carrots 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.830
 we will add our meat to you 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600
 is an idea here so we'll have everything 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:59.730
 seen and not the other veal frau to 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:01.500
 carrots and let them simmer 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.630
 about ten minutes so you can 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.240
 cover leave about ten minutes 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.830
 and then we will put the meat back 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.140
 here you go, that's about ten 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.660
 minutes that our carrots are in the process 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 to write so we will add the pieces 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.700
 of meat that we had removed one and we're going 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.720
 simmer it has the time 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.970
 will I think a good half hour 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.740
 the ideal being to serve this dish on 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.050
 next day in the direction warm up the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.210
 next day the meat will be even more 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.550
 to wait here 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.860
 the recipe is over so by one 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.860
 half an hour we can taste streller
