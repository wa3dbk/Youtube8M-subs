00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.279
 of course, too 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.279

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 Munich lion 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.510

 Dirt now from behind, arranged from behind 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.250
 clear what has been finishing in the last time 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.970
 as a double six never peel 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.020
 Jarolim 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 Guerrero 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.660
 not that bad 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.300
 Part against the test already times 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.260
 Hellmann flawless hat-trick fabricated to lie before him 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.770
 at the and also 18-year-old South Koreans 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.680
 that was natural 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.670
 yes not so doll 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.670
 on the left Karcher has offered 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.549
 for the Wooeste also advance 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.810
 but this experience 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 absolutely yes 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.750
 on the left comes Rische 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.750
 also gets the ball 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.869
 The Rotert offered that looked good 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.529
 now before a combination of red wine 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.529
 in black 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.179
 ze Roberto 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.649
 Matt also had a few years in the past few weeks 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:38.929
 I thought I would leave Red Bull New York was up for grabs 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.119
 but as it looks it stopped again 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.409
 Min Son and everyone on the left 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.569
 November 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.579
 the whole thing a little too slowly too slow at the HSV therefore for the Munich 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:12.709
 lions 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.639
 and the illumination 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:21.379
 ZÃ© Roberto Min Son Petric that was good that was class engine of the defense grains 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 Philipp Tschauner in the gate of the Sechzger 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.109
 South Korea's Koo Bon Moo is also on the left 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.639
 especially 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.359
 HC have to push urgently to come to the train at HSV 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:16.349
 she was not quite so happy with the performances the center-back 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.689
 always on the move 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.689
 No min Son 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.050
 ze Roberto 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.479
 As I said a bit reminds me of the way of playing 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.719
 the dandelion young target group 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:43.150
 it's these little ones 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.349
 the many technicians 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.349
 the long defender always hard to hold Jenson 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.050
 nice pop as wonderful 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 and good play calls Philipp Sauter 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.839
 but now happen 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.110
 in the alley 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.379
 a so-called almost deadly pass on it 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.499
 Romeo Castelen 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.279
 but he will also be happy for the goalkeeper who plays along with good eye 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.279
 heroes 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.229
 min Son 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.620
 Rule itself really good 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.620
 good combination flow 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.849
 Philipp Tschauner 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.559
 Person Suspenders have been great but beautiful that in times Loeb easily again 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.559
 erects 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.830
 easy consolation 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.520
 but this min Son 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.520
 We had to stop here but maybe 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.680
 The more we whirled around 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.309
 in the top at HSV 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.319
 Austrian referees 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.349
 Thomas Eigenthaler has given a small coil 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.969
 Hierro
