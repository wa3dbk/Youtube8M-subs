functionality they like to go with the
one<00:00:31.890> button<00:00:32.250> design<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.030> everything<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
one button design so everything is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
controlled with a single button which

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.420 
controlled with a single button which
gives<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.149> smooth<00:00:36.780> nice<00:00:37.230> finish<00:00:37.860> but

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
gives them a very smooth nice finish but

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
gives them a very smooth nice finish but
at<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> same<00:00:38.790> time<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.260> bit

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
at the same time it can be a little bit

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.869 
at the same time it can be a little bit
of<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> hassle<00:00:40.739> sometimes<00:00:41.070> trying<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> control

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and now you fill just for that one but I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.370 
and now you fill just for that one but I
do<00:01:05.220> believe<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.700> pro<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.380> variable

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
do believe it's pro very variable

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.859 
do believe it's pro very variable
voltage<00:01:08.010> although<00:01:08.580> pro<00:01:08.790> vari<00:01:09.090> sounds<00:01:09.689> much

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
voltage although pro vari sounds much

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.440 
voltage although pro vari sounds much
more<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.380> fancy<00:01:11.070> European<00:01:11.310> sports<00:01:12.119> car

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
more like a fancy European sports car

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
but either way what's it really matter

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030

to<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.270> basically<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> main

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
to it you have basically the main

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.130 
to it you have basically the main
battery<00:01:50.729> tube<00:01:51.000> you've<00:01:51.509> got<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.960> little

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
battery tube you've got your little

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950 
battery tube you've got your little
expansion<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.220> fit<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> 18<00:01:53.790> 650s<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
expansion so it can fit the 18 650s and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.740 
expansion so it can fit the 18 650s and
then<00:01:55.409> you've<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:56.009> key<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> success<00:01:56.750> this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
then you've got your key to success this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.440 
then you've got your key to success this
is<00:01:57.960> actually<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.590> USB<00:01:59.189> plug<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.939> believe<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is actually just a USB plug I believe it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440 
is actually just a USB plug I believe it
has<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.869> video<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.770> how<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.790> produced<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
has the video of how they produced in

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.910 
has the video of how they produced in
some<00:02:03.659> stuff<00:02:03.840> about<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> company<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:04.829> it

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
some stuff about the company and then it

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.679 
some stuff about the company and then it
also<00:02:05.040> has<00:02:05.219> your<00:02:05.369> instruction<00:02:05.969> manual<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
also has your instruction manual and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.570 
also has your instruction manual and
speaking<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> instructions<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.489> actually

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
speaking of the instructions I actually

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.750 
speaking of the instructions I actually
printed<00:02:08.970> mine<00:02:09.420> off<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> site<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.370> yes<00:02:11.580> I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
printed mine off of the site and yes I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.120 
printed mine off of the site and yes I
think<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.030> killed<00:02:12.300> two<00:02:12.569> tree

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
think I killed two tree

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.030 
think I killed two tree
doing<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.670> because<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.390> damn<00:02:14.660> thing<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.170> 33

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
doing it because this damn thing is 33

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.300 
doing it because this damn thing is 33
pages<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.590> instructions<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.920> table<00:02:19.220> of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
pages of instructions is the table of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.450 
pages of instructions is the table of
contents<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.680> there's<00:02:21.920> going<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.130> be<00:02:22.190> plenty

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
contents so there's going to be plenty

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.580 
contents so there's going to be plenty
of<00:02:22.820> stuff<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.300> cover<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.050> full<00:02:24.320> review

just vaping it and for our purposes
knowing<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.710> 20<00:02:34.160> watt<00:02:34.480> variable

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
knowing that it's a 20 watt variable

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.650 
knowing that it's a 20 watt variable
wattage<00:02:35.630> variable<00:02:36.410> voltage<00:02:36.680> e<00:02:37.400> cig<00:02:38.090> mod<00:02:38.330> is

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
wattage variable voltage e cig mod is

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.270 
wattage variable voltage e cig mod is
gonna<00:02:38.840> be<00:02:38.960> what's<00:02:39.140> most<00:02:39.320> important<00:02:39.830> for<00:02:39.980> us<00:02:40.010> I

this I noticed right off the bat whether
you're<00:02:53.180> talking<00:02:53.390> about<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.990> extension<00:02:54.410> tubes

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
you're talking about the extension tubes

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.900 
you're talking about the extension tubes
or<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.720> bottom<00:02:57.500> piece<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.430> basically

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
aerotank mega on it almost like they

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.830 
aerotank mega on it almost like they
were<00:04:01.790> designed<00:04:02.240> together<00:04:04.690> alright<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:05.780> you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
were designed together alright so you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.470 
were designed together alright so you
can<00:04:05.870> see<00:04:06.020> right<00:04:06.200> now<00:04:06.230> set<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.680> 4<00:04:06.920> bolts<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:08.450> a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
can see right now set it 4 bolts it is a

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.990 
can see right now set it 4 bolts it is a
point<00:04:09.140> 9<00:04:09.350> ohm<00:04:10.450> 4.0<00:04:11.450> volt<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:13.610> vaping<00:04:13.910> at

point 9 ohm 4.0 volt and it's vaping at

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.170 
point 9 ohm 4.0 volt and it's vaping at
17.5<00:04:14.959> watts<00:04:15.770> right<00:04:16.130> now<00:04:16.340> give<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:17.330> a<00:04:17.359> shot

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
allows you to get more vapor with a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.820 
allows you to get more vapor with a
short<00:04:32.159> power<00:04:32.550> boost<00:04:33.120> with<00:04:33.750> each<00:04:34.020> puff<00:04:34.409> and<00:04:34.740> I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
short power boost with each puff and I

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.439 
short power boost with each puff and I
do<00:04:34.889> notice<00:04:35.310> man<00:04:35.639> you<00:04:35.789> bake<00:04:35.969> this<00:04:36.150> thing<00:04:36.330> for

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
do notice man you bake this thing for

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.999 
do notice man you bake this thing for
about<00:04:36.509> a<00:04:36.599> second<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.020> half<00:04:37.139> two<00:04:37.349> seconds<00:04:37.830> and

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
about a second a half two seconds and

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:44.980 
about a second a half two seconds and
boom<00:04:38.219> seems<00:04:39.060> like<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.270> got<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.419> full<00:04:39.689> vapor<00:04:39.960> hit

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.320 

actually<00:04:45.990> bakes<00:04:46.229> pretty<00:04:46.560> incredibly<00:04:47.099> I<00:04:47.490> think

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
actually bakes pretty incredibly I think

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330 
actually bakes pretty incredibly I think
this<00:04:48.419> is<00:04:48.539> going<00:04:48.659> to<00:04:48.719> be<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.810> slightly<00:04:49.340> more

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
this is going to be a slightly more

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.580 
this is going to be a slightly more
expensive<00:04:50.490> higher<00:04:51.330> quality<00:04:51.930> version<00:04:52.469> of

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
expensive higher quality version of

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.339 
expensive higher quality version of
something<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.219> the<00:04:53.430> SVD<00:04:54.060> 2.0<00:04:54.840> which<00:04:55.050> is<00:04:55.169> also

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
something like the SVD 2.0 which is also

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.909 
something like the SVD 2.0 which is also
the<00:04:55.650> new<00:04:55.800> 20<00:04:56.219> watt<00:04:56.400> mod<00:04:57.259> now<00:04:58.259> I<00:04:58.289> know<00:04:58.500> some<00:04:58.830> of

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
the new 20 watt mod now I know some of

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.110 
the new 20 watt mod now I know some of
the<00:04:58.979> people<00:04:59.099> like<00:04:59.310> ripped<00:04:59.580> Ripper<00:04:59.879> said<00:05:00.030> they

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
the people like ripped Ripper said they

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.219 
the people like ripped Ripper said they
were<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.240> little<00:05:00.389> disappointed<00:05:00.900> about<00:05:00.990> the

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
were a little disappointed about the

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.689 
were a little disappointed about the
fact<00:05:01.409> that<00:05:01.469> it<00:05:01.620> was<00:05:01.740> only<00:05:01.830> 20<00:05:02.190> watts<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.610> they

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
fact that it was only 20 watts and they

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.950 
fact that it was only 20 watts and they
feel<00:05:02.849> like<00:05:03.000> there's<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.210> lot<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.449> mods<00:05:03.659> and<00:05:03.900> how

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
feel like there's a lot of mods and how

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.020 
feel like there's a lot of mods and how
that<00:05:04.139> are<00:05:04.259> well<00:05:04.409> beyond<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.830> but<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.610> do<00:05:05.729> think

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
that are well beyond that but I do think

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.119 
that are well beyond that but I do think
for<00:05:06.240> most<00:05:06.360> your<00:05:06.629> average<00:05:07.139> vapors<00:05:07.650> people<00:05:07.979> like

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
reliability as well yeah go ahead and

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.980 
reliability as well yeah go ahead and
see<00:05:50.370> how<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.610> vapes<00:05:50.639> on<00:05:51.150> one<00:05:51.509> of<00:05:51.599> the<00:05:51.659> Nautilus

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
see how it vapes on one of the Nautilus

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.540 
see how it vapes on one of the Nautilus
mini<00:05:52.080> tanks<00:05:52.710> since<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.919> know<00:05:53.039> how<00:05:53.129> popular

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
mini tanks since I know how popular

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.100 
mini tanks since I know how popular
those<00:05:53.729> are<00:05:53.969> now<00:05:54.479> we're<00:05:54.629> going<00:05:54.719> to<00:05:54.839> be<00:05:54.900> trying

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
those are now we're going to be trying

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.320 
those are now we're going to be trying
it<00:05:55.169> on<00:05:55.319> a<00:05:55.349> higher<00:05:55.650> resistance<00:05:55.979> I<00:05:56.699> believe<00:05:57.210> this

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
it on a higher resistance I believe this

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.619 
it on a higher resistance I believe this
is<00:05:57.389> a<00:05:57.509> 1/8<00:05:57.990> or<00:05:58.139> 2<00:05:58.560> ohm<00:05:58.830> resistance<00:05:59.360> so<00:06:00.360> it<00:06:00.449> does

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
is a 1/8 or 2 ohm resistance so it does

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.290 
is a 1/8 or 2 ohm resistance so it does
look<00:06:00.779> like<00:06:00.839> it's<00:06:01.110> maxed<00:06:01.589> out<00:06:01.740> at<00:06:02.039> 18<00:06:02.490> point<00:06:02.789> 6

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
look like it's maxed out at 18 point 6

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.579 
look like it's maxed out at 18 point 6
watts<00:06:03.839> on<00:06:04.229> this<00:06:04.889> tank<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.839> 6<00:06:06.839> volts<00:06:07.169> is<00:06:07.289> still

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:07.589 
watts on this tank so 6 volts is still

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:09.589 
watts on this tank so 6 volts is still
the<00:06:07.800> limit<00:06:08.099> on<00:06:08.219> this<00:06:08.430> even<00:06:09.150> though<00:06:09.240> it<00:06:09.330> does<00:06:09.479> go

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
the limit on this even though it does go

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.379 
the limit on this even though it does go
up<00:06:09.690> to<00:06:09.779> 20<00:06:10.050> watts<00:06:10.229> now<00:06:10.620> alright<00:06:11.250> so<00:06:11.370> 18.6<00:06:12.120> watts

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
up to 20 watts now alright so 18.6 watts

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:20.800 
up to 20 watts now alright so 18.6 watts
on<00:06:12.719> the<00:06:13.229> novice<00:06:13.620> aspire<00:06:13.979> mini

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.250
