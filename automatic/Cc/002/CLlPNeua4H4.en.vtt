a<00:00:23.090> raised<00:00:23.240> bed<00:00:23.270> it<00:00:23.900> really<00:00:24.080> has<00:00:24.350> i<00:00:24.920> think<00:00:25.430> all

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
a raised bed it really has i think all

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.189 
a raised bed it really has i think all
you<00:00:25.850> need<00:00:26.029> is<00:00:26.150> like<00:00:26.270> just<00:00:26.690> a<00:00:26.779> simple<00:00:27.080> little

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
you need is like just a simple little

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.370 
you need is like just a simple little
cordless<00:00:27.580> drill<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:28.910> hammer<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.420> probably

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
cordless drill and a hammer and probably

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.990 
cordless drill and a hammer and probably
just<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.650> within<00:00:31.220> an<00:00:31.340> hour<00:00:31.460> i<00:00:31.580> think<00:00:31.730> you

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
just the within an hour i think you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.899 
just the within an hour i think you
could<00:00:32.119> have<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:32.899> have<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:33.469> done<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.039> it<00:00:34.760> makes

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:34.909 
could have it have it done so it makes

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.309 
could have it have it done so it makes
it<00:00:34.999> really<00:00:35.120> easy<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:35.929> are<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.109> benefits

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:36.319 
it really easy what are the benefits

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.020 
it really easy what are the benefits
though<00:00:36.769> of<00:00:36.949> making<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.370> raised<00:00:37.519> bed<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:37.850> mean

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
though of making a raised bed I mean

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.579 
though of making a raised bed I mean
there's<00:00:38.210> all<00:00:38.359> kinds<00:00:38.629> of<00:00:38.659> material<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.350> make

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
there's all kinds of material to make

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.410 
there's all kinds of material to make
the<00:00:39.800> frame<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.249> everything<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:40.819> this<00:00:40.969> one<00:00:41.210> is

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
the frame and everything and this one is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.779 
the frame and everything and this one is
a<00:00:41.449> kit<00:00:41.839> so<00:00:42.409> it's<00:00:42.559> even<00:00:42.739> easier<00:00:42.920> but<00:00:43.339> why<00:00:43.489> would

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
a kit so it's even easier but why would

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.340 
a kit so it's even easier but why would
we<00:00:43.909> want<00:00:44.089> to<00:00:44.179> even<00:00:44.329> put<00:00:44.479> up<00:00:44.539> a<00:00:44.690> raised<00:00:44.839> bed<00:00:44.870> I

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
we want to even put up a raised bed I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.919 
we want to even put up a raised bed I
think<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:46.280> lot<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.850> callers<00:00:47.210> will<00:00:47.420> asks<00:00:47.839> you

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
think a lot of the callers will asks you

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.599 
think a lot of the callers will asks you
know<00:00:48.049> can<00:00:48.289> we<00:00:48.409> use<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:48.769> you<00:00:49.100> know<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.370> of

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
know can we use this you know and of

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.399 
know can we use this you know and of
course<00:00:49.819> Rio<00:00:50.059> Tizer<00:00:50.389> they<00:00:51.170> used<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.469> be<00:00:51.649> very

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
course Rio Tizer they used to be very

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.989 
course Rio Tizer they used to be very
readily<00:00:54.409> available<00:00:54.769> yeah<00:00:55.249> but<00:00:55.519> I<00:00:55.549> don't<00:00:55.819> know

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
readily available yeah but I don't know

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.360 
readily available yeah but I don't know
what's<00:00:56.209> been<00:00:56.359> going<00:00:56.569> on<00:00:56.629> with<00:00:56.859> that<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:58.219> the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
what's been going on with that but the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.979 
what's been going on with that but the
materials<00:00:58.819> that<00:00:58.879> boys<00:00:59.059> we<00:00:59.359> just<00:00:59.600> get<00:00:59.749> a<00:00:59.780> lot<00:00:59.959> of

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
materials that boys we just get a lot of

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.629 
materials that boys we just get a lot of
calls<00:01:00.319> on<00:01:00.589> can<00:01:00.859> we<00:01:00.889> use<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.280> can<00:01:01.519> we<00:01:01.609> then

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.639 
calls on can we use this can we then

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.570 
calls on can we use this can we then
we'd<00:01:01.999> never<00:01:02.269> take<00:01:02.510> guesses<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.010> was<00:01:04.250> it's

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
we'd never take guesses so this was it's

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.810 
we'd never take guesses so this was it's
like<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.940> first<00:01:05.470> one<00:01:06.470> that<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.430> made<00:01:07.700> out

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
like the first one that is it's made out

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.360 
like the first one that is it's made out
of<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.450> know<00:01:08.570> recycled<00:01:09.260> how<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.650> would<00:01:09.800> so<00:01:10.100> we

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
of you know recycled how it would so we

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.920 
of you know recycled how it would so we
know<00:01:10.490> it's<00:01:10.670> safe<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.420> they<00:01:11.510> have<00:01:11.600> actually

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
know it's safe and they have actually

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.480 
know it's safe and they have actually
done<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.110> process<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.710> clean<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.220> they<00:01:13.310> do<00:01:13.370> a

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
done a process to clean it and they do a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.780 
done a process to clean it and they do a
seaman<00:01:14.240> teen<00:01:14.480> and<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.650> it's<00:01:15.800> actually<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.550> very

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
seaman teen and so it's actually a very

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.880 
seaman teen and so it's actually a very
safe<00:01:17.120> product<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.600> use<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.140> it's<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.440> locally

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
safe product to use and it's a locally

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.490 
safe product to use and it's a locally
made<00:01:18.920> company<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.940> Philomath<00:01:20.420> Oregon<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
made company to Philomath Oregon is so

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.560 
made company to Philomath Oregon is so
that's<00:01:21.680> pretty<00:01:21.920> close<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:23.270> actually

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
that's pretty close and it actually

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.300 
that's pretty close and it actually
comes<00:01:23.900> available<00:01:24.110> in<00:01:24.380> two<00:01:24.530> sizes<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.280> you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
comes available in two sizes so you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.340 
comes available in two sizes so you
looking<00:01:25.790> at<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.060> large<00:01:26.390> one<00:01:26.660> in<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:26.900> comes

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
looking at the large one in this comes

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.740 
looking at the large one in this comes
in<00:01:27.470> half<00:01:27.650> right<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.460> so-and-so<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.480> raised

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
in half right that so-and-so a raised

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.000 
in half right that so-and-so a raised
bed<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:30.110> mean<00:01:30.320> they've<00:01:30.470> been<00:01:30.590> around<00:01:30.770> forever

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
bed I mean they've been around forever

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.710 
bed I mean they've been around forever
and<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.430> makes<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.730> little<00:01:31.850> more<00:01:31.970> fancy<00:01:32.210> but

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and this makes a little more fancy but

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.660 
and this makes a little more fancy but
the<00:01:33.080> vegetables<00:01:33.590> look<00:01:33.740> really<00:01:34.010> happy<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:34.490> you

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
the vegetables look really happy and you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.520 
the vegetables look really happy and you
planted<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:35.390> just<00:01:35.420> three<00:01:35.870> weeks<00:01:35.990> ago<00:01:36.260> and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
planted it this just three weeks ago and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.530 
planted it this just three weeks ago and
these<00:01:36.650> are<00:01:36.830> huge<00:01:37.130> yeah<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.850> doesn't<00:01:38.090> take<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.510> I

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
these are huge yeah it doesn't take on I

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.180 
these are huge yeah it doesn't take on I
think<00:01:38.870> that<00:01:39.020> would<00:01:39.290> be<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.470> other<00:01:39.650> benefit<00:01:40.130> is

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
think that would be the other benefit is

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.860 
think that would be the other benefit is
you<00:01:40.310> know<00:01:40.490> we're<00:01:40.640> raising<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.120> up<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:41.660> your

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
you know we're raising this up so your

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.630

soul temperature is getting in all this
you<00:01:44.420> know<00:01:44.510> I<00:01:44.540> think<00:01:44.660> that's<00:01:45.020> another<00:01:45.409> benefit

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
you know I think that's another benefit

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.860 
you know I think that's another benefit
is<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.670> product<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.360> actually<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.720> can

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
use for housing them the idea came from

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.620 
use for housing them the idea came from
that<00:01:50.870> so<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.890> actually<00:01:52.210> creates<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.330> lot<00:01:53.480> more

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.110 
that so this actually creates a lot more
heat<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.620> your<00:01:55.340> soul<00:01:55.580> temperature<00:01:55.970> is<00:01:56.030> going

see all that benefits like that so and I

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.719

think to be growing carrots or onions
radishes<00:02:10.939> I<00:02:11.510> think<00:02:11.689> in<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.870> raised<00:02:12.049> bed<00:02:12.079> you're

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
radishes I think in a raised bed you're

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.679 
radishes I think in a raised bed you're
really<00:02:12.889> gonna<00:02:13.040> get<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.489> better<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:14.060> fruit<00:02:14.510> or

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
really gonna get a better a fruit or

vegetable because there

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.649 
vegetable because there
gonna<00:02:16.189> be<00:02:16.280> going<00:02:16.519> through<00:02:16.670> heavy<00:02:16.879> soil<00:02:17.450> or

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
gonna be going through heavy soil or

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.910 
gonna be going through heavy soil or
anything<00:02:17.959> that's<00:02:18.019> right<00:02:18.349> all<00:02:18.469> your<00:02:18.620> soil

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
anything that's right all your soil

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.649 
anything that's right all your soil
crops<00:02:19.280> would<00:02:19.519> be<00:02:19.700> doing<00:02:19.939> really<00:02:20.060> well<00:02:20.329> and

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
crops would be doing really well and

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.869 
crops would be doing really well and
just<00:02:21.409> so<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.739> brisk<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.489> see<00:02:22.700> would

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
just so the brisk and you can see would

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.059 
just so the brisk and you can see would
have<00:02:22.999> much<00:02:23.269> more<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:24.230> know<00:02:24.349> with<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> better<00:02:24.829> so

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
have much more you know with a better so

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.679 
have much more you know with a better so
they<00:02:25.249> can<00:02:25.370> grow<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.549> lot<00:02:25.670> better<00:02:25.879> like<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
they can grow a lot better like that so

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.839 
they can grow a lot better like that so
right<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.439> then<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.920> walls<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.280> water<00:02:28.400> around

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
right and then the walls of water around

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.410 
right and then the walls of water around
the<00:02:29.450> tomato<00:02:30.409> that<00:02:30.889> helps<00:02:31.189> also<00:02:31.370> right<00:02:32.060> this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
the tomato that helps also right this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.819 
the tomato that helps also right this
was<00:02:32.629> a<00:02:32.659> this<00:02:33.079> has<00:02:33.230> been<00:02:33.290> around<00:02:33.439> for<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.739> long

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
was a this has been around for a long

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.229 
was a this has been around for a long
time<00:02:33.889> these<00:02:34.310> are<00:02:34.459> actually<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:35.030> little

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
time these are actually just little

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.809 
time these are actually just little
walls<00:02:35.810> your<00:02:36.109> cells<00:02:36.349> filled<00:02:37.189> with<00:02:37.340> water<00:02:37.519> and

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
walls your cells filled with water and

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.309 
walls your cells filled with water and
that<00:02:38.090> we've<00:02:38.269> been<00:02:38.389> using<00:02:38.599> for<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> long<00:02:39.049> time

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
that we've been using for a long time

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.349 
that we've been using for a long time
and<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.769> think<00:02:40.069> that's<00:02:40.189> probably<00:02:40.430> some<00:02:40.969> reason

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
and I think that's probably some reason

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.699 
and I think that's probably some reason
why<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> tomatoes<00:02:41.900> are<00:02:41.989> blooming<00:02:42.200> now<00:02:42.379> but

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
why the tomatoes are blooming now but

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.159 
why the tomatoes are blooming now but
they<00:02:43.040> do<00:02:43.099> work<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:44.000> do<00:02:44.389> like<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.780> product
