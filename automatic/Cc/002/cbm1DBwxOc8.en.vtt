00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.380 
hit detection was on par even with host
it<00:04:23.010> was<00:04:23.130> very<00:04:23.370> bad<00:04:23.520> right<00:04:23.909> now<00:04:24.090> we<00:04:24.150> were

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
it was very bad right now we were

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.899 
it was very bad right now we were
playing<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.780> believe<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.050> two<00:04:25.289> bar<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:26.640> in

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
playing on I believe a two bar and in

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.920 
playing on I believe a two bar and in
all<00:04:27.060> these<00:04:27.210> shots<00:04:27.479> worse

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
all these shots worse

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.930 
all these shots worse
killing<00:04:28.320> people<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.610> think<00:04:29.789> that's

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
killing people and I think that's

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.040 
killing people and I think that's
amazing<00:04:30.330> i<00:04:30.389> think<00:04:30.600> i<00:04:30.660> think<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.900> hit

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
amazing i think i think the hit

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.409 
amazing i think i think the hit
detection<00:04:31.169> was<00:04:31.590> was<00:04:32.070> pretty<00:04:32.280> sound<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:33.300> the

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
detection was was pretty sound think the

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.999 
detection was was pretty sound think the
visuals<00:04:33.780> were<00:04:33.930> good<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.380> maps<00:04:34.620> were<00:04:34.770> built

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
visuals were good the maps were built

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.710 
visuals were good the maps were built
pretty<00:04:35.220> nicely<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.940> like<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.300> variety<00:04:36.449> of
