00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.569
 Hello, friends, how are you, 100? 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.209
 welcome to my channel today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:15.950
 let's prepare a sauce in oil or 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:19.530
 as many of us know it as a sauce 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.980
 We are going to need 100 grams of chili 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.740
 dry tree we are going to remove what is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.370
 the tail the little one as you know it 2 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.129
 cloves garlic salt oil will 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.210
 need three quarters of a cup to one 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.059
 cup of oil 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.739
 slightly oil over low heat should not 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.410
 to be very high the fire because what 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.710
 The only thing he's going to do is that we're going to 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.760
 burn the chiles 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.900
 and they are not going to fry properly 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.620
 of not being too much 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:58.470
 here I am going to add the chiles 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 together with garlic cloves 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.989
 and you that you also right here 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.479
 can add peanut or sesame 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.020
 as I will need it for another 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.880
 kind of food I will not add more 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.770
 I had water with holly but if you 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.890
 they like you can add 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.110
 either of the two things here the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.740
 we will be moving 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.020
 in this area 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.500
 Here we will be moving the way 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.400
 that they do not burn anything that burns this 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.850
 process will take 3 to 4 minutes 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.600
 it is very important not to stop moving to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.939
 to brown the chiles parejitos 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.860
 here we see how they have already taken their golden 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.780
 of lava with chiles all 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.790
 now let's let it cool 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.590
 little to be able to grind because if 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.110
 we grind so hot the only thing that's going to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.729
 do is going to jump at the time that 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.159
 is moving and we are going to do nothing 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.399
 more a batidero then let's wait 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.810
 let it cool a little songs that 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.630
 let's add here ours from the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.990
 blender with all the oil that 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.990
 fry 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.660
 and to grind we will not need another 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 thing more than pure oil no water 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.320
 nothing 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.310
 this sauce already ground approximately no 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.420
 It lasts up to 34 months in refrigeration in 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.420
 a jar 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.610
 refractory that is glass and we're 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.890
 very well we put the refrigeration and 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.980
 nothing is going to happen there so we can 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.980
 conserve we are going to add more oil 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.310
 and we are going to add salt 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.349
 if we saw that the blender has 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.769
 difficulties to grind we will go 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.970
 adding more oil until it is 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.970
 totally ground 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.670
 to be able to empty this in a mold 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.640
 Remember nothing of pure water oil here 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.240
 we already moved it 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.080
 the thick 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.300
 this 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.920
 Well, neither that it is too thick nor that 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:25.200
 It is very watery because this is 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.920
 after a while he tends to express himself 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.640
 what is ground then it will be depending 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.830
 as we want it half marked 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.210
 or ground and well then 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.530
 let's try the sauce 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.130
 the truth is very rich we can 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.810
 to serve 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.960
 in post with the pozole a caldito this a 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.470
 often beef belly with what to 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.690
 we we please is very rich in 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.360
 any occasion 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.950
