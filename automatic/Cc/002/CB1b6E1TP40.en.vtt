hello guys have you ever wondered where

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.419 
hello guys have you ever wondered where
your<00:00:03.840> spark<00:00:04.319> plugs<00:00:04.680> are<00:00:05.839> and<00:00:06.839> your<00:00:07.040> 2.4<00:00:08.040> liter

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
your spark plugs are and your 2.4 liter

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.549 
your spark plugs are and your 2.4 liter
twin<00:00:08.820> cam<00:00:09.210> or<00:00:09.870> quad<00:00:10.410> 4<00:00:10.860> as<00:00:11.160> they<00:00:11.340> call<00:00:11.580> it

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
twin cam or quad 4 as they call it

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.829 
twin cam or quad 4 as they call it
that's<00:00:13.559> right<00:00:13.740> under<00:00:13.920> here<00:00:14.330> take<00:00:15.330> these<00:00:15.540> four

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
that's right under here take these four

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.330 
that's right under here take these four
fasteners<00:00:16.410> loose<00:00:17.180> they're<00:00:18.180> actually<00:00:18.750> only<00:00:19.340> 13

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
fasteners loose they're actually only 13

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.980 
fasteners loose they're actually only 13
millimeters<00:00:21.230> we're<00:00:22.230> missing<00:00:22.590> two<00:00:22.680> washers<00:00:23.430> so

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
millimeters we're missing two washers so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.380 
millimeters we're missing two washers so
when<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.590> make<00:00:26.460> sure<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> crush<00:00:27.060> cop

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
when if you are make sure you crush cop

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.779 
when if you are make sure you crush cop
cross<00:00:27.930> them<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.769> impact<00:00:29.160> pushing

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
cross them because the impact pushing

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.639 
cross them because the impact pushing
down<00:00:30.230> actually<00:00:31.850> pushes<00:00:32.850> down<00:00:33.059> these<00:00:33.870> boots

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
down actually pushes down these boots

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.310 
down actually pushes down these boots
under<00:00:35.070> your<00:00:35.190> spark<00:00:35.489> plugs<00:00:35.989> I'll<00:00:36.989> show<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
under your spark plugs I'll show you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.700 
under your spark plugs I'll show you
when<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.010> there<00:00:39.020> all<00:00:40.020> right<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.290> got<00:00:40.680> all

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
when we get in there all right I got all

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
when we get in there all right I got all
the<00:00:41.040> fasteners<00:00:41.640> removed

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the fasteners removed

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.290 
the fasteners removed
now<00:00:43.200> we're<00:00:43.739> missing<00:00:44.129> two<00:00:44.370> washers<00:00:45.000> there

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
now we're missing two washers there

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.400 
now we're missing two washers there
should<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.629> big<00:00:45.899> washers<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:48.020> on<00:00:49.020> top

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
should be big washers like this on top

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.510 
should be big washers like this on top
of<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:51.140> that<00:00:52.140> should<00:00:52.440> come<00:00:52.739> off<00:00:53.039> but

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
of there that should come off but

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.939 
of there that should come off but
they've<00:00:54.090> been<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> while<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
they've been on there for a while that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
they've been on there for a while that
you<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.730> same<00:00:56.940> situation<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.780> me

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you got the same situation as me

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.770 
you got the same situation as me
crisscross<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.760> you'll<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> right

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
crisscross them and you'll get it right

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.919 
crisscross them and you'll get it right
you<00:01:03.780> release<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:04.939> clip<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.240> here

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:30.690 

should<00:01:11.560> be<00:01:11.740> able<00:01:11.829> to<00:01:12.039> just<00:01:13.710> pull<00:01:14.710> up<00:01:14.740> on<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
should be able to just pull up on it and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.649 
should be able to just pull up on it and
there's<00:01:31.000> pretty<00:01:31.420> much<00:01:31.630> your<00:01:31.899> coil<00:01:32.229> pack<00:01:33.659> now

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
there's pretty much your coil pack now

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.699 
there's pretty much your coil pack now
this<00:01:34.929> one<00:01:35.250> may<00:01:36.250> be<00:01:36.280> fried<00:01:37.149> out<00:01:37.479> but<00:01:38.049> learn<00:01:38.590> to

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
this one may be fried out but learn to

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.499 
this one may be fried out but learn to
throw<00:01:38.920> some<00:01:39.130> smart<00:01:39.459> plugs<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:39.969> it<00:01:40.090> anyway

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
throw some smart plugs in it anyway

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.749 
throw some smart plugs in it anyway
maybe<00:01:41.350> I'll<00:01:41.560> get<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:41.740> chance<00:01:42.039> down<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.609> road

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
maybe I'll get the chance down the road

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.410 
maybe I'll get the chance down the road
to<00:01:43.030> show<00:01:43.209> you<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.739> a<00:01:44.770> 97<00:01:45.610> Cavalier<00:01:46.209> by

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
to show you this is on a 97 Cavalier by

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:55.080 
to show you this is on a 97 Cavalier by
the<00:01:46.479> way<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.950> down<00:01:54.189> in<00:01:54.399> there<00:01:54.549> is<00:01:54.909> your

the way right down in there is your
spark<00:01:55.420> plug<00:01:55.750> boots<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:57.189> see<00:01:57.489> them<00:01:57.640> they<00:01:58.060> got

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
spark plug boots you see them they got

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.160 
spark plug boots you see them they got
little<00:01:58.479> springs<00:01:59.079> in<00:01:59.469> them

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170

close see all the oil up on this one
that's<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.910> kind<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.300> stuff<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.720> want<00:03:11.750> to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
that's the kind of stuff you want to

that's the kind of stuff you want to
look<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:13.240> that<00:03:14.240> means<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.870> piston<00:03:15.380> ring<00:03:15.590> is

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
look for that means that piston ring is

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.630 
look for that means that piston ring is
burnt<00:03:16.040> up

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
burnt up

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.780 
burnt up

stuff<00:03:23.990> happens<00:03:24.700> do<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.880> rest<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.300> these<00:03:26.420> have

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
stuff happens do the rest of these have

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.070 
stuff happens do the rest of these have
regular<00:03:27.290> where<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:28.970> look<00:03:29.210> for<00:03:29.510> them<00:03:29.800> to

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
regular where you just look for them to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.800 
regular where you just look for them to
be<00:03:33.080> about<00:03:33.380> even<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:35.030> don't<00:03:35.120> want<00:03:35.420> them<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.630> be

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
be about even you don't want them to be

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.270
