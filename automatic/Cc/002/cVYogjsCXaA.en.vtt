in this tutorial we're going to look at

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.190 
in this tutorial we're going to look at

through<00:01:38.720> din<00:01:39.170> for<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.740> if<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:40.640> look<00:01:40.760> at<00:01:40.850> the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
through din for and if we look at the

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.960 
through din for and if we look at the
port<00:01:41.210> routing<00:01:41.630> we<00:01:42.260> can<00:01:42.440> see<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.310> they<00:01:43.760> show

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
port routing we can see that they show

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.730 
port routing we can see that they show
up<00:01:44.120> there<00:01:44.390> but<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.720> can<00:01:44.870> be<00:01:44.960> difficult<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.530> tell

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
up there but it can be difficult to tell

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.620 
up there but it can be difficult to tell
which<00:01:46.010> devices<00:01:46.430> are<00:01:46.790> connected<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.479> which

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
which devices are connected to which

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.130 
which devices are connected to which
port<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:49.220> we're<00:01:49.640> going<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.000> go<00:01:50.030> back<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.570> as<00:01:50.960> we

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
port so we're going to go back and as we

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.380 
port so we're going to go back and as we
did<00:01:51.320> with<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.590> host<00:01:51.799> port<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.370> device<00:01:53.210> is

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
did with the host port and the device is

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.899 
did with the host port and the device is
connected<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.140> we're<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.799> name<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
connected to it we're going to name the

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.950 
connected to it we're going to name the
items<00:01:56.810> connected<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.040> din<00:01:58.220> ports<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.960> have

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
items connected to the din ports I have

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.859 
items connected to the din ports I have
my<00:02:00.350> iPad<00:02:01.310> sequencer<00:02:02.210> on<00:02:02.390> din<00:02:02.810> port<00:02:03.080> 1<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:04.869> have

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
my microkorg on din port 2 so we'll

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.460 
my microkorg on din port 2 so we'll
replace<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.640> with<00:02:10.819> an<00:02:10.970> alias<00:02:11.299> as<00:02:11.480> well

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.559 

I<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> MS<00:02:16.940> 2000<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.140> import<00:02:18.470> three

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
and I have the rolling gaya ond import

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.119 
and I have the rolling gaya ond import
for<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:32.900> if<00:02:33.019> we<00:02:33.200> look<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:33.469> port<00:02:33.769> routing

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
for now if we look in the port routing

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.280 
for now if we look in the port routing
section<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:35.209> can<00:02:35.239> see<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.629> those<00:02:35.989> names

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
section you can see I have those names

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.319 
section you can see I have those names
visible<00:02:36.769> which<00:02:37.280> makes<00:02:37.579> it<00:02:37.730> easier<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.090> work

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
visible which makes it easier to work
