00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
snowflakes out of that but we're just

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.510 
snowflakes out of that but we're just
gonna<00:01:17.860> use<00:01:18.070> this<00:01:18.220> one

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
gonna use this one

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.870 
gonna use this one
okay<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:19.240> once<00:01:19.540> your<00:01:19.690> cardstock<00:01:20.229> is<00:01:20.560> scored<00:01:21.130> go

okay so once your cardstock is scored go
ahead<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.330> fold<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.869> score<00:01:23.170> lines<00:01:23.380> first

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860

before<00:01:24.190> we<00:01:24.400> start<00:01:24.520> punching<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.509> find<00:01:26.500> that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
before we start punching I find that

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.080 
before we start punching I find that
it's<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.770> little<00:01:26.950> bit<00:01:27.130> easier<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.850> I'm<00:01:30.940> just

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
it's a little bit easier so I'm just

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.310 
it's a little bit easier so I'm just
folding<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.690> like<00:01:31.720> mountain-fold

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
folding it like mountain-fold

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:45.600 
folding it like mountain-fold
valley-fold<00:01:36.539> just<00:01:37.539> fold<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:42.810> okay<00:01:44.429> so<00:01:45.429> once

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
valley-fold just fold it okay so once

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.219 
valley-fold just fold it okay so once
you<00:01:45.700> get<00:01:45.789> your<00:01:45.850> cardstock<00:01:46.390> folded

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
you get your cardstock folded

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.290 
you get your cardstock folded
then<00:01:47.800> go<00:01:47.950> ahead<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.340> open<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.700> up<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.210> just

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
then go ahead and open it up and just

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.359 
then go ahead and open it up and just
run<00:01:50.050> your<00:01:50.170> finger<00:01:50.470> across<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.100> it's

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
run your finger across it so it's

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.719 
run your finger across it so it's
somewhat<00:01:51.789> flat<00:01:53.220> okay<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:54.280> I'm<00:01:54.429> going<00:01:54.550> to<00:01:54.610> use

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
somewhat flat okay so I'm going to use

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.240 
somewhat flat okay so I'm going to use
the<00:01:54.880> lace<00:01:55.090> ribbon<00:01:55.360> border<00:01:55.899> punch<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:57.130> you

okay so when you're finished you're

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.240 
okay so when you're finished you're
gonna<00:02:51.810> have<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> lace<00:02:52.260> border<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.890> looks<00:02:53.100> like

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the reason why we want to fold our

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.800 
the reason why we want to fold our
cardstock<00:02:59.430> before<00:03:00.060> because<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.600> lot

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
cardstock before because it's a lot

cardstock before because it's a lot
easier<00:03:01.440> after<00:03:01.850> once<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.970> punched<00:03:03.360> your<00:03:03.540> lace

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
easier after once you punched your lace

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.470 
easier after once you punched your lace
border<00:03:04.490> it's<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.700> lot<00:03:05.910> easier<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.480> fold<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:08.480> she

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
border it's a lot easier to fold it she

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.940 
border it's a lot easier to fold it she
just<00:03:09.630> gonna<00:03:09.750> fold<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.320> accordion<00:03:10.800> style

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
your where your sticky strip is you're

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.800 
your where your sticky strip is you're
gonna<00:04:14.370> meet<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.910> over<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.510> other<00:04:15.660> side

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810

just like that okay so once you have
your<00:04:20.730> then<00:04:21.450> adhered<00:04:22.080> together<00:04:22.290> with<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
your then adhered together with the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.460 
your then adhered together with the
sticky<00:04:23.010> strip<00:04:23.220> you're<00:04:23.880> going<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.240> gather<00:04:24.870> your

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
sticky strip you're going to gather your

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.470 
sticky strip you're going to gather your
snowflake<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.730> you're<00:04:26.850> going<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.090> push<00:04:27.450> it

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
snowflake and you're going to push it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.700 
snowflake and you're going to push it
together<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:29.460> make<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.730> lay<00:04:30.000> flat<00:04:30.560> just<00:04:31.560> like

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
together to make it lay flat just like

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.360 
together to make it lay flat just like
that<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:33.419> takes<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.720> little<00:04:33.840> practice<00:04:34.220> but<00:04:35.220> then

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
that it takes a little practice but then

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.070 
that it takes a little practice but then
once<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.669> get<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:36.030> together<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.810> will<00:04:36.930> look

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
once you get that together it will look

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.379 
once you get that together it will look
like<00:04:37.110> what

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
like what

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.809 
like what
let's<00:04:40.199> try<00:04:40.409> this<00:04:40.470> again<00:04:40.919> okay<00:04:41.370> so<00:04:41.430> we're<00:04:41.789> just

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
let's try this again okay so we're just

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.930 
let's try this again okay so we're just
gonna<00:04:42.030> lay<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.270> flat<00:04:42.690> like<00:04:43.259> that<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.919> then<00:04:44.789> with

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
gonna lay a flat like that and then with

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.820 
gonna lay a flat like that and then with
your<00:04:45.060> sticky<00:04:45.509> part<00:04:45.960> your<00:04:46.199> sticky<00:04:46.560> sheet

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
your sticky part your sticky sheet

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.080 
your sticky part your sticky sheet
you're<00:04:47.129> just<00:04:47.280> going<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.550> go<00:04:47.639> ahead<00:04:47.699> and<00:04:47.940> layer

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
you're just going to go ahead and layer

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.790 
you're just going to go ahead and layer
that<00:04:48.360> right<00:04:48.629> over<00:04:48.870> top<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:50.240> snowflake<00:04:51.800> so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
that right over top of the snowflake so

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.040 
that right over top of the snowflake so
it<00:04:52.919> holds<00:04:53.069> it<00:04:53.220> in<00:04:53.370> place<00:04:53.669> just<00:04:54.090> like<00:04:54.780> that

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
it holds it in place just like that
