00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.130
 stand yes in the middle of the stage what you call 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.410
 you know that in a circus we are here in the 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.450
 piste ' from circus herman renz so here 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.980
 the show takes place and 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.749
 meanwhile there is in the background 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.810
 rehearsal in progress for ours 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.310
 parrots whisper than laurentiu 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.740
 with the animals every day 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.610
 is trained with the animals every day 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.790
 trained 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.180
 which animals are now in the circus 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.120
 parrots 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.920
 something in and park noble horses and 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.899
 ponies 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.329
 yet again very different because before 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.100
 circus yes we actually know it more 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.500
 of the wild animals 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.270
 yes that's right we don't have that anymore 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.400
 because we anticipate the ban somewhat 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.860
 has been announced that prohibition is still there 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.660
 but not many municipalities think 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.420
 based on the announced plate 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.890
 be able to make rules yourself and yes 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.980
 can impose a ban on a 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.350
 circus what wants to come is not like that 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.450
 but we do see that it is very difficult 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.010
 is because there is no regulation that you 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.809
 you can distinguish 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.159
 how do you come after our neck because who 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.350
 makes up a monkey parrots 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.390
 well we are going to look all over the world 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.130
 we are going to festivals with others 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.260
 ships they watch and we get it 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.909
 offers from artists themselves because we 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.060
 so have a very good name in europe 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.130
 artist likes to work in our arena ' 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.320
 I spotted this act at last year 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.630
 circus knee in switzerland 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.310
 that was actually alessio feet 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.740
 the real training of these parrots 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.530
 he worked there and 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.450
 the man has signed until 2020 so 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.520
 who made it impossible for him to be here 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.220
 but he said i have a student 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.860
 with me who has been working with him for 3 years 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.720
 and he proposes to be an ex 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.909
 specially made for us 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.280
 and that is and it is now with us 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.289
 chooses and so on that basis 10 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.130
 year with our price how long have existed 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.200

 years 100 and 3 years old what really us 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.189
 strong is that we each complete one 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.200
 new show have thereby 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.450

 more than 100 move the lamps hang 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.340
 they can switch that color from 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.310
 form of direction and we take care of it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.200
 that forcing a very contemporary one 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.209
 you get that packaging again 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.640
 spotted somewhere else 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.230

 have groin and punched in costume 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.600
 That way is turning around every year 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.630
 table with a whole team to view 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.370

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.859
 we are going to package it so look there 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.150
 We really are at a very high level 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.519
 Jonas and suddenly watching 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.290
 we are here in the ring of circus 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.970

 Something in the solar park is a whole 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.470
 special really dirty made in italy 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.579
 the animals are alessio features 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.489
 and that is a very familiar one 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.910
 Italian parrots whisperer and then 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.069

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.690
 this year exclusively in the piste of 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.870
 circus herman renz of this act is 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.400
 specially made for us and this dad 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.549
 are you going to fly during the show 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.139
 upstairs has audience and so yes they do 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.090
 no strange things she can't enter 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.889
 search in a steerable car 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.410
 yes they fly in front of hit top left 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.790
 audience and the people in the gallery 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.739
 sit that also feel the wind of the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.980
 Parrot wings gone along 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.050
 that's a big difference 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.490
 how long has he been to a trainer 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.020
 with the parrot 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.810
 then for this I has three years 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.030
 rehearsed and those who 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.820
 with which he soaked together so already for them 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.290
 who have been doing it all his life 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.450
 in the circus world you say parrots 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.930
 do you come to that man from italy 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.170
 justly 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.630
 yes that's why we got to this 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.360
 nice to see how loving he is 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.580
 the parrot looks absolute because that is 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.770
 also how you can work together 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.100
 with animals like you yes if none 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.440
 trust between the die and the 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.240
 the animal and the trains then you reach 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.010
 nothing so it is very important you well 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.230
 contact with the animals 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.459
 every day you are all working with 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.750
 happened 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.030
 yes yes happy day practical and the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.390
 love now 'praise service what proves well 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.100
 how the big bang if you like the animals 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.720
 they will not give love and attention 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.370
 also not a good job during the force in 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.110
 this is it is very important to him 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.110
 that he can put you in the cyst every day 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.870
 rehearsing and yes the one time there is what 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.120
 animal pain because people are allowed to look and yes 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.240
 the other time that just happens 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.280
 this is the rehearsals are every day so 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.530
 that is very important to see that too 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.810
 people don't it is much more than an act 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.220
 seven minutes in the show 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.640
 is actually having people with animals 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.510
 Just 24 hours a day makes such 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.090
 parrot 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.770
 really that to the person himself yes 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.440
 dad you go together realizing that 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.940
 really yes very intelligent and yes that 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.710
 really have a connection with being there 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.790
 totally different from a horse like you 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.910
 a horse 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.500
 learns the commands and then knows 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.120
 which movements you have to make how one 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.210
 to present a few 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.310
 then everyone can do that with parrot 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.750
 the number then you really need a band with it 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.910
 because otherwise you can never reach 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.810
 will then be late in our forcing 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.180
 see 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.930
 so then lifelong is actually with the 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.360
 parrot 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.360
 absolutely yes friendship for life
