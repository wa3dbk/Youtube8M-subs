up like this and you have access to
these<00:01:01.530> plug<00:01:01.829> wires<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.120> sure<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
these plug wires you make sure that this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.210 
these plug wires you make sure that this
plug<00:01:04.650> wire<00:01:04.920> which<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> number<00:01:06.180> five<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:07.229> over

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
plug wire which is number five is over

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.660 
plug wire which is number five is over
there<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
there to where you can see it when you

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.750 
there to where you can see it when you
plug<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> distributor<00:01:12.900> cap<00:01:13.760> make

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
plug it into the distributor cap make

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.370 
plug it into the distributor cap make
sure<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.180> three<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:15.990> tagged

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
sure all three of them have are tagged

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
sure all three of them have are tagged
to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> correct<00:01:17.340> hole<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.540> sure<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to the correct hole to make sure that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.760 
to the correct hole to make sure that
they<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> distributor<00:01:19.740> cap<00:01:20.450> correctly

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.920 

so<00:01:25.770> since<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.520> plenum<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.210> there's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so since we have the plenum off there's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.120 
so since we have the plenum off there's
easy<00:01:28.290> access<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> EGR<00:01:30.180> valve<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.950> went

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
easy access to the EGR valve so we went

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.800 
easy access to the EGR valve so we went
ahead<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.400> remove<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.659> we're

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
ahead and remove that and now we're

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.780 
ahead and remove that and now we're
getting<00:01:33.990> ready<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> clean<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.009> EGR<00:01:35.310> valve

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.370 

this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> EGR<00:01:39.479> valve<00:01:42.140> these<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
this is the EGR valve these are the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
this is the EGR valve these are the
tools<00:01:43.619> we're<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.310> clean<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:47.479> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
tools we're going to use to clean it so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.289 
tools we're going to use to clean it so
once<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.930> clean<00:01:49.759> I'll<00:01:50.759> show<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> how

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
once I get that clean I'll show you how

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.719 
once I get that clean I'll show you how
much<00:01:51.509> dirt<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.140> gunk<00:01:52.530> comes<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> EGR

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
much dirt and gunk comes out of the EGR

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.069 
much dirt and gunk comes out of the EGR
valve<00:01:54.060> which<00:01:54.240> will<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> bottom<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
valve which will be in the bottom of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.039 
valve which will be in the bottom of
this<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:56.060> then<00:01:57.060> we'll<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.780> thing

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this and then we'll have that thing

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.469 
this and then we'll have that thing
cleaned<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> reinstalled<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.149> at<00:02:00.299> least

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
cleaned up and reinstalled so at least

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.020 
cleaned up and reinstalled so at least
we<00:02:00.750> know<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.350> EGR<00:02:01.770> valve<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.369> clean<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
we know that the EGR valve is clean and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.290 
we know that the EGR valve is clean and
operating<00:02:03.960> properly<00:02:07.550> okay<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> EGR

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
operating properly okay this is the EGR

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
operating properly okay this is the EGR
valve<00:02:09.629> scraped<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.800> knife<00:02:11.069> right

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
valve scraped out with this knife right

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.330 
valve scraped out with this knife right
here

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
here

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.930 
here
if<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.450> look<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.840> here<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.440> see<00:02:17.790> how<00:02:18.790> much

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
if you look in here you can see how much

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.550 
if you look in here you can see how much
cleaner<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.569> because<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.170> get<00:02:20.290> all<00:02:20.319> that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
cleaner it is because you get all that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.520 
cleaner it is because you get all that
carbon<00:02:21.069> out<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:22.959> now<00:02:23.230> we're<00:02:23.380> going<00:02:23.470> to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
carbon out and then now we're going to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.490 
carbon out and then now we're going to
hit<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.770> with<00:02:23.860> brake<00:02:24.250> clean<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.970> used<00:02:28.500> this

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
hit it with brake clean and used this

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.850 
hit it with brake clean and used this
little<00:02:29.680> wire<00:02:29.980> brush<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:32.230> clean<00:02:32.440> up<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.680> rest

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
little wire brush to clean up the rest
