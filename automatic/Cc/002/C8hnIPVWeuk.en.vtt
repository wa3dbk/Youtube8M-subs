00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
this is going to be a short video of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.599 
this is going to be a short video of
several<00:00:03.120> variations<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:04.140> what<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.890> call<00:00:05.279> a

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
several variations of what I call a

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.780 
several variations of what I call a
simple<00:00:06.089> stitch<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.690> straight<00:00:06.839> stitch<00:00:07.670> could<00:00:08.670> be

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
simple stitch a straight stitch could be

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.400 
simple stitch a straight stitch could be
a<00:00:08.820> split<00:00:09.120> stitch<00:00:09.769> if<00:00:10.769> you'll<00:00:11.010> notice<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:12.410> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
first two rows I've done the stitch is

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.099 
first two rows I've done the stitch is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
coming up to the left of the previous

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.849 
coming up to the left of the previous
row<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> back<00:00:21.660> side<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:25.230> coming<00:00:25.529> up

about right here and I'm gonna come up

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:59.810 
about right here and I'm gonna come up
on<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.780> left<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.710> stitch<00:00:50.010> below<00:00:57.199> okay<00:00:58.820> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
on the left of the stitch below okay so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
on the left of the stitch below okay so
you'll<00:01:00.000> notice<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.539> particular<00:01:00.870> pattern

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you'll notice this particular pattern

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.429 
you'll notice this particular pattern
has<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> fairly<00:01:03.000> straight<00:01:03.329> stitch<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
has a fairly straight stitch on the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.850 
has a fairly straight stitch on the
front<00:01:04.729> but<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.760> back<00:01:06.080> comes<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.350> looking

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
front but the back comes out looking

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.370 
front but the back comes out looking
somewhat<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.330> brick<00:01:10.020> pattern<00:01:10.700> okay<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
somewhat like a brick pattern okay a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.469 
somewhat like a brick pattern okay a
second<00:01:13.380> variation<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
second variation if you want the back to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.740 
second variation if you want the back to
look<00:01:15.659> exactly<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.860> front<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
look exactly like the front and this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.010 
look exactly like the front and this
gets<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.619> harder<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> stitches

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
gets a little bit harder as the stitches

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
gets a little bit harder as the stitches
get<00:01:22.200> further<00:01:22.530> apart<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.640> fact<00:01:23.970> here's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> good

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
get further apart in fact here's a good

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.350 
get further apart in fact here's a good
example<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:25.020> something<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:26.009> here

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
example of something I can do right here

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.859 
example of something I can do right here
the<00:01:27.360> distance<00:01:27.780> between<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:29.009> stitches

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
the distance between these two stitches

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.300 
the distance between these two stitches
it's<00:01:30.869> getting<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.350> bit<00:01:31.560> further<00:01:31.860> than<00:01:31.979> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it's getting a little bit further than I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.390 
it's getting a little bit further than I
like<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.509> there<00:01:33.900> are<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.140> number<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> ways<00:01:34.829> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
like so there are a number of ways to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.179 
like so there are a number of ways to
insert<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> stitch<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.320> way<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> do

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
insert a stitch the the way I like to do

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.980 
insert a stitch the the way I like to do
it<00:01:38.340> which<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.729> simplest<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.659> simply

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it which is the simplest is just simply

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.270 
it which is the simplest is just simply
take<00:01:40.759> one<00:01:41.759> extra<00:01:41.939> ramp<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> road<00:01:45.380> okay<00:01:46.409> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
take one extra ramp in the road okay you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.380 
take one extra ramp in the road okay you
could<00:01:47.430> also<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:49.970> stitch<00:01:50.970> through<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
could also actually stitch through the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
could also actually stitch through the
row<00:01:51.570> below<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.320> tends<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> break<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
row below but that tends to break the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.819 
row below but that tends to break the
pine<00:01:53.280> needles<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.909> usually<00:01:54.210> don't<00:01:54.710> now<00:01:55.710> if

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
pine needles so I usually don't now if

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289 
pine needles so I usually don't now if
you<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> back<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.579> look<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you want the back to look just like the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.800 
you want the back to look just like the
front<00:01:58.040> then<00:01:59.040> what<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.520> would<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.240> insert

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
front then what you would do is insert

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.700 
front then what you would do is insert
your<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.740> needle<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:03.360> left<00:02:03.689> side<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
your your needle on the left side of the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.230 
your your needle on the left side of the
stitch<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.310> probably<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:05.909> hard<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
stitch it's probably a little hard to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.410 
stitch it's probably a little hard to
see<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> left<00:02:07.200> side

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
see but on the left side

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:20.540 
see but on the left side
and<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.899> come<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.860> right<00:02:14.099> side<00:02:19.550> of

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and you come out on the right side of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:31.009 
and you come out on the right side of
the<00:02:20.790> prior<00:02:21.060> stitch<00:02:25.280> okay<00:02:28.400> if<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
the prior stitch okay if you do this and

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.479 
the prior stitch okay if you do this and

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
again I'm just going to take an extra

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:40.820 
again I'm just going to take an extra
wrap<00:02:32.819> right<00:02:33.150> here<00:02:35.989> if<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.470> again

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
wrap right here if you do this and again

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.030 
wrap right here if you do this and again
come<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.940> left<00:02:42.150> come<00:02:42.870> out<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.799> the
