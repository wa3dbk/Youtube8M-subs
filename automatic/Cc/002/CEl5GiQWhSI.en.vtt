zigzag is very easy to get used to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.619 
zigzag is very easy to get used to
because<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.370> handled<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> same<00:00:51.210> way<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
because it's handled the same way as a

zig zag chain of friction links because

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.660 
zig zag chain of friction links because
there<00:00:59.320> are<00:00:59.379> so<00:00:59.530> many<00:00:59.680> breaking<00:01:00.550> it's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
there are so many breaking it's

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.849 
there are so many breaking it's

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
progressive so the arborist movements

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.710 
progressive so the arborist movements
are<00:01:03.039> very<00:01:03.339> smooth<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.970> control<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.420> speed<00:01:07.689> of
