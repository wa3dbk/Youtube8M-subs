00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
okay so for the bagua stepping you need

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.249 
okay so for the bagua stepping you need
to<00:00:11.459> make<00:00:11.999> yourself<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> circle<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> diameter

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
to make yourself a circle the diameter

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.369 
to make yourself a circle the diameter
of<00:00:13.799> your<00:00:13.860> height<00:00:14.579> so<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> got<00:00:15.419> stats<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:16.170> my

height okay more or less what I'll do is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.190 
height okay more or less what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:18.840> lay<00:00:18.990> down<00:00:19.970> on<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.030> ground<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.020> get

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
I'll lay down on the ground and you get

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.620 
I'll lay down on the ground and you get
some<00:00:22.500> tape<00:00:22.770> or<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.160> rocks<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.790> just<00:00:24.330> mark

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

and Mark it here and give it one more

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.920 
and Mark it here and give it one more
quarter<00:00:49.260> turn<00:00:49.560> and<00:00:50.690> mark<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.239> Mark

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
quarter turn and mark it here and Mark

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.610 
quarter turn and mark it here and Mark
it<00:00:55.050> here

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.190 

so<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> circle<00:01:00.020> that's<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
so now I have a circle that's the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.090 
so now I have a circle that's the
diameter<00:01:01.650> of<00:01:01.860> my<00:01:02.040> height<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.949> our

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
diameter of my height so we have our

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
diameter of my height so we have our
circle<00:01:05.400> built<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> work<00:01:07.200> on

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
circle built I'm going to work on

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.290 
circle built I'm going to work on
locking<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> circle<00:01:08.310> okay<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.760> walk<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
locking the circle okay so walk in the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.390 
locking the circle okay so walk in the
circle<00:01:09.690> is<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:10.050> develop<00:01:10.260> many<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
circle is going to develop many of the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
circle is going to develop many of the
four<00:01:11.640> areas<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.120> talked<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
four areas we talked about in the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
four areas we talked about in the
previous<00:01:13.470> video<00:01:13.770> which<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> four

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
previous video which are the four

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
previous video which are the four
reasons<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> train<00:01:15.690> boggle<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
reasons to train boggle we have the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
reasons to train boggle we have the
physical<00:01:16.890> body<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.060> visual

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
physical body we have the visual

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
physical body we have the visual
awareness<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> fighting

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
awareness we have the fighting

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.210 
awareness we have the fighting
application<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.080> mental<00:01:22.650> focus

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
application and we have the mental focus

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.850 
application and we have the mental focus
and<00:01:23.610> acuity<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.690> from<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> beginning<00:01:25.020> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and acuity so from the beginning you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.320 
and acuity so from the beginning you
want<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.280> stand<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.910> side<00:01:26.940> of<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
want to just stand on one side of the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
want to just stand on one side of the
circle<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> maybe<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.890> bow<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.520> that's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
circle and maybe do your bow but that's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850 
circle and maybe do your bow but that's
going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.330> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.660> force<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.560> be

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
going to do is going to force you to be

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.490 
going to do is going to force you to be
focused<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.970> ballast<00:01:33.479> beginning<00:01:33.899> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
focused from the ballast beginning to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
focused from the ballast beginning to
the<00:01:34.619> bowels<00:01:35.039> ending<00:01:35.550> you're<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.330> have

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the bowels ending you're going to have

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.290 
the bowels ending you're going to have
an<00:01:36.690> uncanny<00:01:37.410> focus<00:01:38.160> that's<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> train

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
an uncanny focus that's going to train

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.900 
an uncanny focus that's going to train
to<00:01:39.420> become<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:39.990> mentally<00:01:40.500> tough<00:01:40.800> that<00:01:41.340> nothing

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
to become so mentally tough that nothing

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.210 
to become so mentally tough that nothing
can<00:01:42.090> distract<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.830> mind<00:01:44.070> to

baggage<00:03:18.200> will<00:03:18.410> they<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.770> slide<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.670> think

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
baggage will they like to slide I think

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.460 
baggage will they like to slide I think
that<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.780> ridiculous

like<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.530> we<00:03:24.650> turn<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.160> center<00:03:25.550> we're

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
like that so we turn to the center we're

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.960 
like that so we turn to the center we're
going<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:25.940> walk<00:03:26.150> like<00:03:26.540> we're<00:03:26.810> walking<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:27.290> mud

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
up your feet and what that's doing is

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.390 
up your feet and what that's doing is
creating<00:03:33.790> physical<00:03:35.860> athleticism<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:37.280> your
