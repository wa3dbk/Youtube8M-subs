00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.689 

I<00:00:15.049> think<00:00:16.049> Nikki<00:00:16.350> hospital<00:00:17.039> even<00:00:17.100> crew<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.490> used

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
I think Nikki hospital even crew so used

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.790 
I think Nikki hospital even crew so used
to<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> bus<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.199> year<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:19.619> I'm

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
to have a bus but this year I think I'm

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800 
to have a bus but this year I think I'm
the<00:00:19.949> only<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.570> big

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the only one and I think it's a big

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.200 
the only one and I think it's a big
advantage<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:22.619> I'm<00:00:22.800> able<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.000> come

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
advantage you know if I'm able to come

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.960 
advantage you know if I'm able to come
here<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.510> train<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.019> my<00:00:25.050> bike<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.490> I'm<00:00:26.490> saying

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
here and train on my bike and I'm saying

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.990 
here and train on my bike and I'm saying
you<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.570> two<00:00:28.349> minutes<00:00:28.710> from<00:00:28.949> from<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> lift

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you know two minutes from from the lift

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.939 
you know two minutes from from the lift
then<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.539> pretty<00:00:30.929> convenient<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> think

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
then it's pretty convenient so I think

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.549 
then it's pretty convenient so I think
it's<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.369> an<00:00:32.820> advantage<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.690> I'm<00:00:34.020> lucky<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it's a an advantage and I'm lucky that I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.700 
it's a an advantage and I'm lucky that I

five oh yeah I only I don't have it for
every<00:01:05.339> race<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> definitely<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> here

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
every race but I definitely have it here

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
every race but I definitely have it here
for<00:01:07.080> conchagua<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.850> st.<00:01:09.060> marys<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
for conchagua and also for st. marys and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.020 
for conchagua and also for st. marys and
then<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> finals<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> quad<00:01:11.070> mean<00:01:11.310> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
then what the finals in the quad mean so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
then what the finals in the quad mean so
it's<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> races<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.979> think

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it's not for all the races but I think

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
it's not for all the races but I think
it's<00:01:14.549> an<00:01:14.820> advantage<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> have

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it's an advantage you think if you have

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
it's an advantage you think if you have
at<00:01:16.770> farthest<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.189> few<00:01:17.340> answers<00:01:17.700> well<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> mean

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
at farthest a few answers well I mean

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620 
at farthest a few answers well I mean
I've<00:01:19.350> seen<00:01:19.619> other<00:01:19.799> athletes<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.759> at

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I've seen other athletes do it and at

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.270 
I've seen other athletes do it and at
first<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.020> wasn't<00:01:22.350> sure<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> was<00:01:22.979> such<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
first I wasn't sure if that was such a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
first I wasn't sure if that was such a
good<00:01:23.460> idea<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.420> lot<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.600> work<00:01:24.900> but

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
good idea because it's a lot of work but

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
good idea because it's a lot of work but
I'm<00:01:25.890> lucky<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> Red<00:01:26.670> Bull<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.150> sponsor

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I'm lucky that Red Bull is my sponsor

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
I'm lucky that Red Bull is my sponsor
and<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.290> take<00:01:28.500> care<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> everything<00:01:29.040> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and so they take care of everything for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.819 
and so they take care of everything for
me<00:01:29.460> they'd<00:01:29.880> put<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> bus<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.470> set<00:01:31.710> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
me they'd put the bus here they set it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.490 
me they'd put the bus here they set it
up<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> don't<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> worry<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
up so I don't have to worry about it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.760 
up so I don't have to worry about it
and<00:01:34.890> until<00:01:35.430> Irish<00:01:35.700> come<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.360> live<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.320> race

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and until Irish come I live here a race

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
and until Irish come I live here a race
and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> next<00:01:39.150> race<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.689> it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and then I go to the next race so it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.760 
and then I go to the next race so it's
pretty<00:01:40.470> easy<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:41.070> me<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.430> yeah<00:01:42.619> okay<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
pretty easy for me and yeah okay so I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.889 
pretty easy for me and yeah okay so I
think<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.220> big<00:01:44.399> advantage

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
think it's a big advantage

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.090 
think it's a big advantage
beeping<00:01:45.899> I'll<00:01:46.110> put<00:01:46.409> Oggy<00:01:46.649> bunny<00:01:46.829> leash
