think something is gonna go wrong
somewhere<00:03:23.870> down<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.230> line<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.650> not<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:24.830> good

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
somewhere down the line it's not a good

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.620 
somewhere down the line it's not a good
idea

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
idea

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.370 
idea
etc<00:03:26.630> uh<00:03:27.640> but<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:29.360> know<00:03:29.480> we're<00:03:29.810> also<00:03:30.020> have<00:03:30.260> to

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
etc uh but you know we're also have to

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.020 
etc uh but you know we're also have to
keep<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.680> real<00:03:30.860> she<00:03:31.340> didn't<00:03:31.520> look<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.790> bad

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.420 
keep it real she didn't look that bad
I'm<00:03:32.959> surprised<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.770> she<00:03:33.980> looked<00:03:34.220> that

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
I'm surprised that she looked that

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.620 
I'm surprised that she looked that
decent<00:03:35.240> and<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:36.800> her<00:03:37.370> plumbing<00:03:38.060> point<00:03:38.360> might

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
decent and it her plumbing point might

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.040 
decent and it her plumbing point might
have<00:03:38.750> been<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.200> little<00:03:39.860> absurd<00:03:40.240> but<00:03:41.240> kind<00:03:41.959> of

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
have been a little absurd but kind of

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.070 
have been a little absurd but kind of
fun<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.590> not<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.280> bad<00:03:43.580> we<00:03:44.360> do<00:03:44.600> mess<00:03:44.840> with

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
fun and not that bad we do mess with
