00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
foundation so I'm just going to dot it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.319 
foundation so I'm just going to dot it
on<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.259> using<00:01:43.710> slight<00:01:44.130> pressure<00:01:44.520> I'm

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
on and then using slight pressure I'm

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.510 
on and then using slight pressure I'm
going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:46.229> literally<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:46.890> spread<00:01:47.340> this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
going to like literally just spread this

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760 
going to like literally just spread this
all<00:01:47.729> over<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.270> skin<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:49.079> using<00:01:49.409> slight

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
all over my skin just using slight

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
all over my skin just using slight
pressure<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.820> reason<00:01:51.180> I'm<00:01:51.299> using<00:01:51.509> slight

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pressure the reason I'm using slight

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.899 
pressure the reason I'm using slight
pressure<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.799> if<00:01:53.130> I've<00:01:53.340> got<00:01:53.640> any

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
pressure is so then if I've got any

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.920 
pressure is so then if I've got any
areas<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.780> need<00:01:55.290> filling<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.570> will

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
areas that need filling in then it will

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
areas that need filling in then it will
get<00:01:58.200> filled<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.329> giving

haven't a clue but but I do not use Mac
and<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.600> use<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:32.500> basically<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.220> you

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
and so I use this a bit basically if you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.370 
and so I use this a bit basically if you
similar<00:02:33.640> skin<00:02:33.910> tone<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.330> me<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.080> should

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
similar skin tone to me then it should

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.790 
similar skin tone to me then it should
match<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.660> normally<00:02:37.660> when<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.959> do<00:02:38.230> not<00:02:38.470> want<00:02:38.709> to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
match so normally when I do not want to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.340 
match so normally when I do not want to
be<00:02:38.920> applying<00:02:39.400> foundation<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:40.450> use<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
be applying foundation I use this and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.960 
be applying foundation I use this and
this<00:02:41.760> tends<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.970> cover<00:02:43.330> up<00:02:43.630> nicely<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:45.580> can

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
this tends to cover up nicely so you can

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.390 
this tends to cover up nicely so you can
see<00:02:46.180> like<00:02:46.480> I've<00:02:46.720> got<00:02:47.050> redness<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.280> is

just go over the areas where I feel as

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.180 
just go over the areas where I feel as
though<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.209> needs<00:03:16.560> covering<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.650> bit<00:03:17.799> more<00:03:17.980> and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
though it needs covering a bit more and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.009 
though it needs covering a bit more and
correcting<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.360> you're<00:03:19.450> probably<00:03:19.630> going<00:03:19.930> to

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
correcting and you're probably going to

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.990 
correcting and you're probably going to
think<00:03:20.200> well<00:03:21.010> why<00:03:21.370> didn't<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.670> do<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
think well why didn't you do the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.199 
think well why didn't you do the
correcting<00:03:22.510> first<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.230> because<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:24.310> CC<00:03:24.820> cream

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
correcting first is because the CC cream

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.500 
correcting first is because the CC cream
it's<00:03:25.540> amazing<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.470> build<00:03:26.709> upon<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.510> without

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
it's amazing to build upon and without

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.770 
it's amazing to build upon and without
looking<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.410> heavy<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.670> tend<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.239> put<00:03:31.540> down

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
looking so heavy so I tend to put down

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.180 
looking so heavy so I tend to put down
the<00:03:32.410> CC<00:03:32.950> cream<00:03:32.980> first<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:34.320> then<00:03:35.320> my<00:03:35.560> corrector

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
the CC cream first and then my corrector

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.479 
the CC cream first and then my corrector
and<00:03:36.780> then<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.049> CC<00:03:38.290> cream<00:03:38.440> again<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.250> it

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
and then the CC cream again and it

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.900 
and then the CC cream again and it
covers<00:03:39.940> really<00:03:40.299> nicely<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:42.489> last<00:03:42.670> thing

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
covers really nicely and the last thing

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.600 
covers really nicely and the last thing
is<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.180> conceal<00:03:43.989> anywhere<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:44.799> feel<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.400> though

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
is to conceal anywhere I feel as though

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.210 
is to conceal anywhere I feel as though
it<00:03:45.760> has<00:03:46.000> not<00:03:46.239> been<00:03:46.480> covered<00:03:47.440> properly<00:03:47.769> so

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
it has not been covered properly so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.949 
it has not been covered properly so
anyway<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.790> bet<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.150> we<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.420> darker

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
anyway that I bet if we have darker

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.670 
anyway that I bet if we have darker
areas<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:51.790> right<00:03:52.090> here<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:56.320> a<00:03:56.380> concealer

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
areas so just right here and a concealer

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
areas so just right here and a concealer
