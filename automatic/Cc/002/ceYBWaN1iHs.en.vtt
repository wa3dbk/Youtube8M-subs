00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.980
 oh well yeah I do not know maybe 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.840

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 driving after a good ease my 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.610
 last time I asked you for them 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.870
 pure shot now i'm going to ask 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.150
 for ball driving etc 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.530
 it's a dinguerie I can not get bonus 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.570
 look i'll fix your problem 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.680
 the first thing to do when you do 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.950
 the ball driving for it to be 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.720
 pretty 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's to take a good player age one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 sheet there relocate the roof master for 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 school I'm young with the trigger 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.989
 left with the left analog stick 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.520
 forgive me I'm moving forward 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.600
 but until grilling choices then to 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.950
 stop racing speed modification 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 in the morning the two rear triggers 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.790
 while he will tend christian as in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.470
 the previous movie exactly be the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.380
 player limits y slide a little on the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.180
 sides in front behind 300 Swiss had 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.370
 not chase then you have the dribble on 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.610
 square button morning lb on xbox or 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.200
 the l1 key on ps3 do you see this 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.229
 that he's doing up there up and here it looks like a 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.990
 brazilian yeah you see the little 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.459
 family and that's exactly after I 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 can push the ball if you want I 

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:12.929
 maintain all these rations and you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 push the right analog stick towards 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:16.829
 the front goes where you want it but it's going 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.600
 for driving it's perfect for 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.819
 thomas time the ball checks for 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.350
 making too much wine limits the 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.649
 player he will have a pot of glue in the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.329
 crampon 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.649
 this match had the front left trigger 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.209
 to receive the balloon to hide the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.509
 page I walk to the left trigger and 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:33.349
 see the joy the left mismatch cnt or l2 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.179
 on the spot has exactly reverse on channel 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:39.810
 j 1 bedroom then in chile to make 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.670
 so a control very simple you 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.069
 pass and with the left trigger 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.319
 and orients in the side volume voilages 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.630
 mint at the baule who goes there it's not hard 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.090
 yeah I confess then I still have better 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.959
 a very nice technical trick you do 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.849
 oriented control 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.499
 but in the player's race the yellow 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.810
 in full course aprilia who is there I 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.039
 want to make it pass and to 20 by the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.419
 haunted controller I want to maintain the 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.929
 right trigger 

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:04.770
 ok so you go on the playmaker on play 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.739
 exactly age 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.789
 here is the control way up I hit 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.469
 I mark it's not hard for that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.989
 I'm dead now, but I 'll tell you 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.760
 show a fairly technical gesture for 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.709
 control and lift the ball 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.209
 before doing the control and chained 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.769
 by a half volley like thierry henry to 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.400
 the time look at that hop 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.680
 yeah you see nothing i'm going to give him a 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.189
 vestige of the impasse I support and bim 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.959
 you see in addition I scored then before 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.629
 to receive the ball I maintained the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.510
 trigger left prime already several 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.519
 times on grass and so ra on ps3 and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.290
 after I tell everyone hit me and then 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.750
 here 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.430
 yeah but frankly it helped me this 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.170
 that you tell me if I had any 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.819
 examples of gameplay would be even better 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.510
 what are you showing to the world 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.510
 immediately in match 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.870
