when they see leash because they know

when they see leash because they know
that<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.110> means<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:14.890> time<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.250> go<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.910> walk

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
don't let the leash be that special

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.610 
don't let the leash be that special
thing<00:02:18.430> they<00:02:18.610> see<00:02:18.670> only<00:02:19.120> when<00:02:20.080> they're<00:02:20.260> going

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
thing they see only when they're going

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.740 
thing they see only when they're going
for<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.860> walk<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.459> can<00:02:21.610> clip<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.209> on<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.660> off

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
for a walk you can clip it on and off

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.660 
for a walk you can clip it on and off
several<00:02:23.170> times<00:02:23.319> throughout<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.190> day<00:02:24.400> even

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
several times throughout the day even

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.790 
several times throughout the day even
when<00:02:25.330> you're<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.900> anywhere<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.680> they

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
when you're not going anywhere so they

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.729 
when you're not going anywhere so they
realize<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.520> putting<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.569> leash<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.959> doesn't

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.059 
realize that putting a leash on doesn't
really<00:02:29.860> mean<00:02:30.100> anything<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:34.500> think<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.040> of

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
really mean anything I think that one of

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.360 
really mean anything I think that one of
the<00:02:36.190> main<00:02:36.550> reasons<00:02:37.239> why<00:02:37.780> dogs<00:02:38.110> pull<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:38.860> walks

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the main reasons why dogs pull on walks

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.000 
the main reasons why dogs pull on walks
is<00:02:39.760> because<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:40.330> want<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.630> go<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.200> sniff<00:02:41.680> I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
is because they want to go and sniff I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.640 
is because they want to go and sniff I
think<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:42.610> OK<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.600> dog<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.320> do<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
think that it's OK for a dog to do that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.320 
think that it's OK for a dog to do that
I<00:02:44.680> mean<00:02:44.920> it's<00:02:45.070> one<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> main<00:02:45.610> reasons<00:02:46.090> we

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
I mean it's one of the main reasons we

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.030 
I mean it's one of the main reasons we
take<00:02:46.570> them<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:46.930> walks<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.470> first<00:02:47.709> place

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
take them on walks in the first place

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.430 
take them on walks in the first place
however<00:02:48.519> we<00:02:48.850> have<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.269> add<00:02:49.390> some<00:02:49.690> structure<00:02:50.290> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
however we have to add some structure to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.729 
however we have to add some structure to
this

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
this

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.250 
this
don't<00:02:50.890> let<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.190> dog<00:02:51.400> decide<00:02:51.880> whenever<00:02:52.720> they

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
don't let the dog decide whenever they

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.680 
don't let the dog decide whenever they
want<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.590> stop<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.280> sniff<00:02:54.670> when<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.450> see<00:02:55.660> a
