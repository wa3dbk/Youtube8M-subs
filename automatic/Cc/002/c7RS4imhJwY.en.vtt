00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
is pretty close to blue so when we edit

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.720 
is pretty close to blue so when we edit
it<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.520> wax<00:02:41.390> later<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.200> then<00:02:42.620> it'll<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.520> be

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
it in wax later on then it'll just be

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.360 
it in wax later on then it'll just be
all<00:02:43.910> blended<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.840> mess<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.100> want<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
all blended in mess and so you want to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.550 
all blended in mess and so you want to
change<00:02:47.090> your<00:02:47.210> stick<00:02:47.450> figures<00:02:47.840> color<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:49.670> a

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.400 
like two seconds and so obviously this
video<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.520> not<00:04:54.060> going<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.540> match<00:04:54.720> up<00:04:54.750> with<00:04:55.170> it

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
video is not going to match up with it

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.680 
video is not going to match up with it
so<00:04:55.920> we<00:04:56.040> have<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.280> click<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.210> drag<00:04:57.390> that<00:04:57.450> down

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
so we have to click and drag that down

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.370 
so we have to click and drag that down
just<00:04:58.230> shorten<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.070> out<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> bit<00:04:59.430> and<00:05:00.260> there<00:05:01.260> we

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
just shorten it out a bit and there we

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.620 
just shorten it out a bit and there we
go<00:05:01.410> we<00:05:01.590> have<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.800> two<00:05:02.150> things<00:05:03.150> right<00:05:03.420> there

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
go we have the two things right there

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.630 
go we have the two things right there

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
but obviously we can't see through to it

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.160 
but obviously we can't see through to it

that's pretty good right there and there

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.820 
that's pretty good right there and there
we<00:06:33.589> go<00:06:33.619> you<00:06:34.219> can<00:06:34.399> now<00:06:34.580> see<00:06:34.969> through<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.569> the

we go you can now see through to the

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.419 
we go you can now see through to the
video<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:38.259> it<00:06:39.259> can<00:06:39.469> make<00:06:39.499> longer<00:06:39.800> animation

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:40.429 
video and it can make longer animation

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:46.449 
video and it can make longer animation
short<00:06:40.729> animations<00:06:41.419> and<00:06:42.219> all<00:06:43.219> that<00:06:43.569> so<00:06:45.459> then
