00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.770
 have commented that the tomatoes already 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:09.750
 they do not taste like tomatoes that have no aroma and 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:14.440
 that certainly are not like before 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.570
 welcome to the reef the tomato is a 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.420
 of the horticultural species more 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.310
 important in the world only in Spain 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.519
 they produce more than 2 and a half million 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.970
 tons being one of the most crops 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.730
 extended would be enough to multiply the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.219
 kilos of tomato for its market price 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.710
 and we will begin to understand where is the 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.309
 origin of the mysterious loss of flavor 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.079
 of this popular food everything starts 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.480
 with the overcrowding of the crop 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.930
 tomato what leads to a reduction 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.500
 of the genetic variety of 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.800
 this species more productive and they go 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.110
 replacing others with lower production 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 leaving very few varieties 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.420
 cultivated 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.810
 this genetic impoverishment added to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.400
 intensive production techniques 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.520
 led to the appearance of new 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.830
 diseases of the tomato to be the tomato 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.810
 grown on large farms and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.500
 being also commercialized in a 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.670
 global economy has led to the expansion 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.290
 all over the world of new diseases 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 of tomato many of them devastating 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.970
 a plague you can fumigate a mushroom it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 can treat but if a 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.460
 plant is a virus for that little bit 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.509
 can do 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.300
 The consequences of crop loss is 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.150
 say loss of money 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.150
 for having is an example tomato virus 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.880
 like the well-known tanning virus or 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.690
 the yellow curly virus can 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.930
 assume losses of up to 50% of the 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.930
 tomato production something that the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.290
 sector industry is not willing to 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.170
 support the best solution to combat 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.110
 these viruses would recover the wealth 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 genetic cultivate different varieties and 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.190
 return to small crops and 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.950
 local trade of products 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.560
 agricultural but the business of the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.250
 agriculture is a prey that the big 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.440
 companies have no intention of letting go 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.050
 so the solution they have sought 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.120
 it is none other than finding varieties 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.150
 resistant to the virus 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.460
 that is, the solution is not another 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.430
 that the hybrid 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.450
 and here begins the loss of flavor to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.940
 tomato the tomatoes that we are eating 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.530
 they are hybrids 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.020
 that is, these new tomatoes are not 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.560
 100% tomatoes since in its genome it 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.510
 find part of other species 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.440
 compatible with the tomato that without being 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.420
 can contribute to this resistance to 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.640
 Certain diseases 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.830
 for the tomato industry what 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.010
 important these new hybrids is that 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.550
 they have to be productive and resistant 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.860
 to diseases the consequence is 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.410
 that the continuous modification of the tomato 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.739
 in search of more resistance and more 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.540
 production has paradoxically caused 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.730
 that the tomato disappears hopefully that 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.880
