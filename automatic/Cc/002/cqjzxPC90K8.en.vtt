00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.180
 today there is halloween tail and that 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:15.929
 with a mask 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:18.270
 Are you looking forward to it you know 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 yes I like to work with latex 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.340
 but what if you do not have a latex? 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.590
 and daniela dicks but maybe you have 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.599
 her a mask at home if we have one 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.300
 playoff mask at home is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 halloween actually already saved 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 open the mask you can of course 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.969
 well tuned so sniff as I they 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.850
 smells really good then we'll meet it on the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 make the like would naturally 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.890
 the case is that it's mine first 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.360
 cheek 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.100
 I have to show you that he is right 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 you can of course also on 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.629
 use arm or neck or anywhere 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 that it does not matter where it stops 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.149
 yes, that's what we lubricate first 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.949
 our face on it in the case like 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.949
 first said the cheeks 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.600
 if you have applied you have to 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.729
 Wait for 20 minutes until it is 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.950
 really dry is not one 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.350
 good story on if then that takes 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.799
 even longer until it is dry in one 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.679
 case 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.450
 i was a little impatient yes and it 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.799
 stuck a bit but there are 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.109
 worse is not so bad 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.609
 that's not what it really holds 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.039
 make up 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.030
 So we want to open our jobs now 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.909
 we need our new one 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.859
 Hautsfetzen and that is very much 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.259
 just if it's not sticky like that 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.520
 down below you can see nice 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.469
 can pull it off well 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.209
 oh man because lack could see that too 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.500
 that goes super easy does too 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:54.500
 does not hurt at all 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 Super fast 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.150
 We take our best 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.030
 make-up what we have one really 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.920
 beautiful opaque and brush it all 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.850
 Of course he has to look like somehow 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.210
 not true at all 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.350
 that's why it's all beautifully painted 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.120
 if it shimmers through a bit blue 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.250
 It was not that bad 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.020
 I for one look like it as yet 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.890
 such a small blue spot below 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.830
 the wound also very cool so with 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.310
 Brushes are brushing and then a little bit 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.310
 let dry 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.410
 then the red lipstick comes back 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.820
 for use 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.540
 I do not know why but I find the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.910
 you do not always have to do really great 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.270
 but if you have that then you can 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.680
 you can smear your art blood up 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.620
 that's what we really wanted 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.340
 a lot of art blood is purely there in the new 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.070
 round 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.090
 nice the whole skin flaps still 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.840
 daub 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.040
 that also looks reasonably real and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.660
 then we are actually already good 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.430
 As good as finished it looks at you 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.800
 it's super easy you do not need it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.600
 latex but only a european on 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.310
 Mask I think that does not even cost 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.160
 one euro so that I even 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.630
 cheaper and you're done already 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.610
 that could really be on the whole body 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.430
 He had skin flaps everywhere 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.280
 and wounds I find quite cool 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.560
 it 's just such a halloween live stern 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.900
 I would say it is very fast 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.640
 made very cheap and great result 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.730

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.990

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.540
