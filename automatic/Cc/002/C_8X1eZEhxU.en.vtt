00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
for Raptors crackler he is the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.100

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so let's do lands to swamps six

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.889 
so let's do lands to swamps six
mountains<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:40.079> guild<00:00:40.469> gates<00:00:41.600> for<00:00:42.600> blood

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
mountains to guild gates for blood

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.740 
mountains to guild gates for blood
crypts<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.730> for<00:00:44.730> temporal<00:00:45.059> analysis<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
crypts and for temporal analysis so you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.209 
crypts and for temporal analysis so you
don't<00:00:45.960> actually<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.440> many<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.920> drops

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
don't actually have that many one drops

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.920 
don't actually have that many one drops
because<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.760> lands<00:00:48.149> come<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.510> play<00:00:48.660> tap

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
because your lands come and play tap

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
because your lands come and play tap
which<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> okay<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:49.950> your<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.399> drops<00:00:50.640> are

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
which is okay because your two drops are

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.410 
which is okay because your two drops are
extremely<00:00:51.239> strong<00:00:52.129> breeze<00:00:53.129> spike<00:00:53.820> jesters
