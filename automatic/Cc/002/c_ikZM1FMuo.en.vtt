00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.260
 I apply the obvious prime minister's face 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.389
 I apply a very light foundation but 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.640
 stratifiable in order to obtain a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.640
 covering result but not too heavy 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.190
 I apply a fluid corrector with a 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.190
 very thick brush 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.590
 fixed with a duvet the checker and the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.750
 central part of my face 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:08.990
 all this with an opaque powder 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:11.479
 very light on the rest of the face I go 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.050
 instead with a brush and a figure 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.050
 bright 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 apcom premer eyes slightly colored 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 to inform you more 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 I apply over the entire mobile eyelid or 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.680
 more in chin sampan slightly 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.680
 very delicate satin finish 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.390
 I apply this color in piety 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 caramel paco and with a pico brush e 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 with another clean faded intensify them the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.410
 shade with a little more warm brown 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410
 dark 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.820
 I apply under the browbone a 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.820
 unclear eye shadow 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.690
 I apply a cold brown pencil 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.390
 inside the rhyme and I recommend it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.110
 cold brown because otherwise it appears 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.990
 that you have 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.030
 let's say a little blood to the eye a 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.070
 At this point I make a laner arrive 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.670
 not too double or too much 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.670
 elongated

 I apply a lot of false eyelashes 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.470
 natural are to thicken my own 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.970
 apply a mascara with the brush 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 very thin so as not to weigh it down 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.240
 look 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.980
 I call them my eyebrows with a 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.100
 eyebrow pencil that turns into 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.100
 red 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.170
 with the earth, on average, ask and a 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.599
 smaller brush I recreate the shadows 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.159
 under the cheekbone and the user ati 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.159
 even a little on the nose 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.510
 ap with dull peach blush from the center 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.510

 apcom a very light illuminant on 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:07.520
 cheekbones I outline the lips 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.490
 with a kata colored pencil and a lot 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.130
 versatile that allows me to redefine 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.980
 well the contour of the lips and also of 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.850
 rebuild the slightly lowered side 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.460
 of my apply this beautiful 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:35.000
 Lipstick caught very bright and 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:37.220
 vent well with the pencil I undo hair 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.560
