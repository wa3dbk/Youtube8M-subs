the holster we're going to get to that
in<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> minute<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.060> right<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.390> we're<00:01:06.479> just

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
in a minute because right now we're just

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
in a minute because right now we're just
going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> focus<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> case<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.159> first

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
going to focus on the case so first

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.649 
going to focus on the case so first
thing<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> break<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.630> down

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
thing I have to do is break it all down

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.350 
thing I have to do is break it all down
as<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.200> mentioned<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.280> two<00:01:11.580> cases<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.180> one

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
as I mentioned this is two cases in one

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.929 
as I mentioned this is two cases in one
essentially<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.950> slim<00:01:14.670> case

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
essentially what you get is a slim case

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
essentially what you get is a slim case
for<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> days<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.259> need<00:01:16.439> maximum

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
for the days when you don't need maximum

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
for the days when you don't need maximum
protection<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.240> two<00:01:18.659> additional

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
protection and then two additional

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.770 
protection and then two additional
components<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> add<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.610> top<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
components which you add on top of the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.929 
components which you add on top of the
slim<00:01:22.049> case<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.950> make<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.250> into<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> more

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
slim case to make it into a more

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
slim case to make it into a more
protective<00:01:24.540> case<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> two

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
protective case so these are the two

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.499 
protective case so these are the two
additional<00:01:26.670> pieces<00:01:27.000> which<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.360> going

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
additional pieces which I'm just going

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.270 
additional pieces which I'm just going
to<00:01:27.659> move<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> frame<00:01:28.259> right<00:01:28.500> now<00:01:28.530> because

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to move out of frame right now because

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.499 
to move out of frame right now because
right<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> focus<00:01:30.210> on

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
right now we're just going to focus on

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.789 
right now we're just going to focus on
the<00:01:30.689> slim<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.380> we're<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the slim and then we're just going to

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
the slim and then we're just going to
kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.070> build<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.939> thing<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.170> so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
kind of build this thing up as I go so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.039 
kind of build this thing up as I go so
let<00:01:35.009> me<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> everything<00:01:35.460> apart<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
let me get everything apart so this is

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
let me get everything apart so this is
called<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.740> surface<00:01:38.070> case<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.090> is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
called the surface case and this is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.130 
called the surface case and this is
CBO's<00:01:40.049> slim<00:01:40.650> protective<00:01:41.610> case<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.720> nexus

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
thing down and remove the holster I'm

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.390 
thing down and remove the holster I'm
not<00:04:45.780> quite<00:04:46.020> sure<00:04:46.050> why<00:04:46.470> I'd<00:04:46.530> want<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:47.070> do<00:04:47.220> that

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
not quite sure why I'd want to do that

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.180 
not quite sure why I'd want to do that
but<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.360> option<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.900> there<00:04:48.980> it's<00:04:49.980> a<00:04:50.040> little

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
but the option is there it's a little

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.530 
but the option is there it's a little
bit<00:04:50.310> difficult<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.880> do<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.120> when<00:04:51.390> you're

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
bit difficult to do that when you're

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.300 
bit difficult to do that when you're
wearing<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:51.960> your<00:04:51.990> belt<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:52.530> I'm<00:04:52.950> thinking

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
wearing it on your belt so I'm thinking

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.070 
wearing it on your belt so I'm thinking
that<00:04:53.460> if<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.760> like<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.570> whole<00:04:54.720> store<00:04:54.960> you're
