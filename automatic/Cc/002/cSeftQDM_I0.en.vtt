00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello in this blog i am going to explain more 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.509
 about hair loss 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.690
 I give you some tips for the home and such 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.040
 give advice for in our clinic 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.480
 how come that story is from 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.820
 our voice he three phases 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 The first phase is the growth phase 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.730
 this is on the phase that lasts the longest 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 the second phase is the transition phase 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.930
 her growth stopped and her starts 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.510
 to sit ours 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.300
 the third phase is the resting phase 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 here and what her house falls into 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.989
 want that is the first phase along it 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760
 lasts and that the hair stays tight 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.739
 to sit 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.930
 this can be disrupted 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.579
 this in various causes we can 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.260
 for example, disrupted fashion runs 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 have a lot of bad ones 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 blood circulation or impaired 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 nutrient intake 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.489
 can also be medication and cause of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.890
 hair loss are disturbed hormone balance 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.859
 and in impaired blood circulation 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.329
 can cause stress 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.270
 when we are stressed the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.280
 adrenalina made in our body 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.890
 when the adrenaline comes in contact 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.189
 it becomes full with the sebaceous glands 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.840
 lactic acid produced nature arrives in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.229
 contact our hair with our 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.600
 hair root which makes after rest and so 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.610
 can fall out faster 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.200
 google happen to anyone well you can 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.210
 of course ensure that they him 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.130
 the stress in our lives but also 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.430
 regularly like a scalp massage 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.439
 give when my good solid courts 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.810
 giving passage becomes blood flow 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.189
 stimulated and there will also be oxygen 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 free 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.049
 thereby reducing the hair loss 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.850
 whatever the cause if they 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.110
 Hair loss is therefore a connection 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.509
 nutrient intake 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.420
 this all has to do with ours 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.310
 nutrition and for example our diet 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.470
 sir are you following or how is one 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.899
 We have a reduced crash diet 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.790
 intake of nutrients from vitamins 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.930
 minerals 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.610
 well we can make sure we 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.160
 more vitamins and minerals 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.830
 get through our diet 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.770
 bicycles from the fruit vegetables and also the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.300
 meat but we can too 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.890
 take a nutritional supplement 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.770
 what is also very important is the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.510
 vitamin B and the iron this also ensures 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.810
 for that they will be her and less quickly 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.440
 fall out as art in our clinic 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.810

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.700
 Well we offer the mesotherapy yes 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.420
 Mesotherapy is a cocktail that we are in 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.500

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 active ingredients 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.610
 differences make 9 for sure 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.040
 the waste to dispose of for 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.190
 the build-up of hair but also building materials 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.620
 are injected in liquids 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.450
 where it is needed 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.580
 the treatments are around 10 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.800
 treatments needed and be distributed 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.570
