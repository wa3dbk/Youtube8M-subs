best vacuum we can make on earth and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
best vacuum we can make on earth and

pretty<00:01:05.880> good<00:01:06.060> vacuum<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.049> remember<00:01:07.500> space<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
pretty good vacuum but remember space is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
pretty good vacuum but remember space is
big<00:01:08.810> there's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> hundred<00:01:10.290> centimeters<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> 1

kilometer<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:14.250> light-year<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.850> about<00:01:15.270> 10

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
kilometer and one light-year is about 10

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
kilometer and one light-year is about 10
trillion<00:01:16.380> kilometers<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> nearest<00:01:18.360> star

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
trillion kilometers and the nearest star

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.649 
trillion kilometers and the nearest star
to<00:01:18.750> us<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.140> about<00:01:19.350> four<00:01:19.619> light-years<00:01:19.860> away<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
to us is about four light-years away and

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.060 
to us is about four light-years away and
most<00:01:21.659> stars<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.170> even<00:01:22.380> farther<00:01:22.619> away<00:01:22.770> than

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
most stars are even farther away than

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160 
most stars are even farther away than
that<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.759> star<00:01:23.970> Betelgeuse<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.689> example<00:01:25.080> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that the star Betelgeuse for example is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.990 
that the star Betelgeuse for example is
about<00:01:25.380> six<00:01:25.740> hundred<00:01:25.830> forty<00:01:26.430> light-years<00:01:26.610> away

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
about six hundred forty light-years away

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.330 
about six hundred forty light-years away
so<00:01:27.780> even<00:01:28.259> though<00:01:28.290> there's<00:01:28.530> only<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.040> molecule

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so even though there's only one molecule

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
so even though there's only one molecule
per<00:01:29.729> cubic<00:01:30.000> centimeter<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
per cubic centimeter that's a lot of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.920 
per cubic centimeter that's a lot of
molecules<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.610> call<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.060> stuff<00:01:33.420> between<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
molecules we call this stuff between the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.020 
molecules we call this stuff between the
stars<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.470> interstellar<00:01:35.070> medium<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
stars the interstellar medium it's

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
stars the interstellar medium it's
mainly<00:01:36.329> made<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.780> hydrogen<00:01:36.930> plus<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> little

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
mainly made up of hydrogen plus a little

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
mainly made up of hydrogen plus a little
bit<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> other<00:01:38.100> gases<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> some<00:01:38.970> dust<00:01:39.180> thrown

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
bit of other gases and some dust thrown

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.749 
bit of other gases and some dust thrown
in<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.689> well<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.650> denser<00:01:41.100> regions<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
in as well the denser regions of this

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580 
in as well the denser regions of this
almost<00:01:42.180> look<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.329> clouds<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.229> an<00:01:43.320> infrared

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
almost look like clouds to an infrared

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
almost look like clouds to an infrared
telescope<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.700> call<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.030> infrared

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
telescope so we call them infrared

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.800 
telescope so we call them infrared
cirrus<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:47.180> even<00:01:48.180> though<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.450> stuff<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
cirrus and even though this stuff is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.230 
cirrus and even though this stuff is
mind-bogglingly<00:01:49.710> thin<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.790> look<00:01:51.030> through

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
mind-bogglingly thin if you look through

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
mind-bogglingly thin if you look through
light-years<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> eventually<00:01:52.439> blocks

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
light-years of it it eventually blocks

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
light-years of it it eventually blocks
out<00:01:53.189> all<00:01:53.340> visible<00:01:53.820> light<00:01:54.060> coming<00:01:54.420> through<00:01:54.450> but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
out all visible light coming through but

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
out all visible light coming through but
infrared<00:01:55.829> light<00:01:56.100> gets<00:01:56.460> through<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.729> little<00:01:56.969> bit

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
infrared light gets through a little bit

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.620 
infrared light gets through a little bit
more<00:01:57.180> easily

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
more easily

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.820 
more easily
understanding<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.750> interstellar<00:02:00.260> medium<00:02:00.410> is

understanding the interstellar medium is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.200 
understanding the interstellar medium is
one<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.250> areas<00:02:01.400> where<00:02:01.790> infrared

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
one of the areas where infrared

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.480 
one of the areas where infrared
telescopes<00:02:02.720> really<00:02:03.020> shine<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.680> speak<00:02:03.830> it's
