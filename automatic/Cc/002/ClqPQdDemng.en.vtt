00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
your airbrush in claw and claws though

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.109 
your airbrush in claw and claws though
that<00:01:33.900> gumming<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.710> your<00:01:35.369> trigger<00:01:35.579> your

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that gumming up your your trigger your

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
that gumming up your your trigger your
trigger<00:01:36.630> isn't<00:01:36.750> working<00:01:37.500> working<00:01:38.159> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
trigger isn't working working just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
trigger isn't working working just
looked<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:40.259> gotta<00:01:40.439> look<00:01:40.560> right

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
looked at in there you gotta look right

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
looked at in there you gotta look right
down<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.340> paint<00:01:41.610> I've<00:01:41.939> had<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
down there and see paint I've had that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.950 
down there and see paint I've had that
happen<00:01:42.450> maybe<00:01:42.720> five<00:01:43.079> times<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:45.119> long<00:01:45.329> time

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
happen maybe five times in a long time

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.520 
happen maybe five times in a long time
so<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:47.399> probably<00:01:47.880> isn't<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.229> turning<00:01:49.229> quick

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
so it probably isn't that turning quick

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.569 
so it probably isn't that turning quick

on<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.420> tip<00:02:09.660> mainly<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.590> your<00:02:10.800> needle<00:02:11.099> okay

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
on your tip mainly on your needle okay

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.449 
on your tip mainly on your needle okay
so<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.840> paint<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.440> dries<00:02:13.769> all<00:02:14.160> the

so if you get paint that dries all the

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.000 
so if you get paint that dries all the
way<00:02:14.580> around<00:02:15.000> there<00:02:15.470> what<00:02:16.470> happens<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.860> it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
way around there what happens is it

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.229 
way around there what happens is it
clogs<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.849> little<00:02:18.209> hole<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:20.640> allowing<00:02:21.030> paid

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
clogs the little hole not allowing paid

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.670 
clogs the little hole not allowing paid
to<00:02:21.390> escape<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.870> pattern<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.410> want

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.559 
to escape in the pattern that you want
right<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.280> makes<00:02:23.459> your<00:02:23.610> needle<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.180> twice

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
that will help also so hopefully it's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.410 
that will help also so hopefully it's
one<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.389> those<00:03:48.660> things<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:50.670> reason<00:03:50.849> we<00:03:51.120> try

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
one of those things the reason we try

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.110 
one of those things the reason we try
those<00:03:51.900> first<00:03:51.930> before<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:53.069> disassembly<00:03:54.060> in

harder<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:58.410> well<00:03:59.069> it's<00:03:59.250> basically<00:03:59.579> impossible

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
harder to well it's basically impossible

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.470 
harder to well it's basically impossible

harder<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.769> do<00:04:07.950> with<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.510> with<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.599> ways

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
harder to do with that with the ways

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.059 
harder to do with that with the ways
