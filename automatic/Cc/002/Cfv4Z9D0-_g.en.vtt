00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:36.750 

feels<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.769> camera

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.979 

and<00:03:37.269> what<00:03:37.930> do<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.080> know<00:03:39.629> even<00:03:40.629> looks<00:03:40.810> like<00:03:40.959> a

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
and what do you know even looks like a

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.929 
and what do you know even looks like a
camera

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.800 

it's<00:03:47.359> actually<00:03:47.659> smaller<00:03:47.959> than<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.290> expected<00:03:48.799> it

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
it's actually smaller than I expected it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.390 
it's actually smaller than I expected it
for<00:03:50.810> some<00:03:50.989> reason<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.499> was<00:03:51.739> led<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.310> believe

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
for some reason I was led to believe

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.369 
for some reason I was led to believe
that<00:03:52.639> this<00:03:52.969> is<00:03:53.090> about<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.389> same<00:03:53.719> size<00:03:53.930> as<00:03:54.230> an

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
that this is about the same size as an

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.459 
that this is about the same size as an
EM<00:03:54.530> camera<00:03:55.599> but<00:03:56.599> it's<00:03:56.780> actually<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.230> little<00:03:57.349> bit

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:57.469 
EM camera but it's actually a little bit

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:58.830 
EM camera but it's actually a little bit
smaller

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
smaller

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.780 
smaller
there's<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.170> aperture<00:04:00.560> ring<00:04:00.590> where<00:04:01.489> we<00:04:01.609> love

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
there's the aperture ring where we love

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.280 
there's the aperture ring where we love
that<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:04.099> shutter<00:04:04.340> speed<00:04:04.459> dial<00:04:05.290> exposure

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
that and the shutter speed dial exposure

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.270 
that and the shutter speed dial exposure
compensation<00:04:06.739> on<00:04:07.639> and<00:04:08.090> off

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
compensation on and off

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.190 
compensation on and off
alright<00:04:10.280> then<00:04:10.489> well<00:04:10.670> let's<00:04:10.879> see<00:04:11.209> what<00:04:11.870> else<00:04:12.049> we
