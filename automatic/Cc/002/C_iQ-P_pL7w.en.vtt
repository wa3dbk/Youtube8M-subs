good quality of life additions coming I
really<00:02:38.010> thought<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.190> lot<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:38.610> stuff

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
really thought a lot of this stuff

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.190 
really thought a lot of this stuff
should<00:02:39.090> have<00:02:39.210> been<00:02:39.360> included<00:02:39.510> when<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.020> game

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
should have been included when the game

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
should have been included when the game
first<00:02:40.230> came<00:02:40.590> out<00:02:40.800> but<00:02:41.160> better<00:02:41.880> late<00:02:42.000> than

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
first came out but better late than

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.660 
first came out but better late than
never<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.600> suppose<00:02:42.750> as<00:02:43.320> for<00:02:43.980> vault<00:02:44.190> space<00:02:44.490> I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
never I suppose as for vault space I

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.520 
never I suppose as for vault space I
think<00:02:44.700> we'll<00:02:45.060> end<00:02:45.240> up<00:02:45.390> seeing<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.990> by<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.200> time

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
think we'll end up seeing it by the time

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.560 
think we'll end up seeing it by the time
house<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.160> wolves<00:02:47.340> comes<00:02:47.790> around<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.300> wouldn't

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
house of wolves comes around it wouldn't

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.000 
house of wolves comes around it wouldn't
surprise<00:02:48.660> me<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.140> they<00:02:49.200> couldn't<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.860> it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
surprise me if they couldn't get it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.070 
surprise me if they couldn't get it
ready<00:02:50.190> until<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.670> next<00:02:50.850> expansion<00:02:51.210> although

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
ready until the next expansion although

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.990 
ready until the next expansion although
I<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.380> we<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.680> agree<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:53.550> sooner<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
I think we can all agree the sooner the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.570 
I think we can all agree the sooner the
better<00:02:54.120> as<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:55.110> how<00:02:55.290> much<00:02:55.680> extra<00:02:56.070> vault<00:02:56.340> space

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
better as for how much extra vault space

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.970 
better as for how much extra vault space
I'm<00:02:56.790> hoping<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.330> at<00:02:57.450> least<00:02:57.660> another<00:02:57.930> 20<00:02:58.650> slots

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
I'm hoping for at least another 20 slots

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.370 
I'm hoping for at least another 20 slots
but<00:02:59.760> another<00:03:00.000> thing<00:03:00.210> I'd<00:03:00.360> like<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
but another thing I'd like to see is the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.950 
but another thing I'd like to see is the
shader<00:03:01.860> emblem<00:03:02.550> ship<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.150> class<00:03:03.510> item

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
shader emblem ship and class item

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.230 
shader emblem ship and class item
inventories<00:03:04.680> reworked<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.120> can

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
inventories reworked so that we can

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.850 
inventories reworked so that we can
actually<00:03:06.390> start<00:03:06.780> collecting<00:03:07.380> those<00:03:07.500> things

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
actually start collecting those things

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.010 
actually start collecting those things
right<00:03:08.550> now<00:03:08.790> they<00:03:09.120> work<00:03:09.300> like<00:03:09.480> every<00:03:09.870> other

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
right now they work like every other

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.260 
right now they work like every other
item<00:03:10.140> making<00:03:10.920> collecting<00:03:11.430> all<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.640> them<00:03:11.880> very

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
item making collecting all of them very

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.330 
item making collecting all of them very
very<00:03:12.570> difficult<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.320> hope<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:13.890> at<00:03:14.040> some<00:03:14.070> point

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
very difficult I hope that at some point

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.280 
very difficult I hope that at some point
they<00:03:14.760> change<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.390> everything<00:03:15.930> in

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
they change it so that everything in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.740 
they change it so that everything in
those<00:03:16.470> categories<00:03:16.890> just<00:03:17.850> goes<00:03:18.000> into<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.360> list

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
those categories just goes into a list

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.960 
those categories just goes into a list
and<00:03:19.050> doesn't<00:03:19.530> act<00:03:19.650> like<00:03:19.830> an<00:03:20.040> actual<00:03:20.370> item<00:03:20.790> so

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
and doesn't act like an actual item so

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.760 
and doesn't act like an actual item so
you<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.240> have<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.570> many<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.560> collect

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
you can have as many as you can collect

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.530 
you can have as many as you can collect
we'll<00:03:23.459> see<00:03:23.640> what<00:03:23.760> happens<00:03:23.850> with<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.209> though

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
we'll see what happens with that though

we'll see what happens with that though
