battlefield<00:02:23.150> fours<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.170> think<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.590> this

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
battlefield fours now I think that this

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.470 
battlefield fours now I think that this
game<00:02:24.890> will<00:02:25.190> use<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.640> battlefield<00:02:26.090> setting

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
game will use the battlefield setting

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.630 
game will use the battlefield setting
but<00:02:26.720> will<00:02:26.870> focus<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.379> much<00:02:27.590> much<00:02:27.890> smaller<00:02:28.219> Maps

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
but will focus on much much smaller Maps

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.759 
but will focus on much much smaller Maps
and<00:02:28.909> will<00:02:29.030> include<00:02:29.299> more<00:02:29.750> tactical<00:02:30.290> movement

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
and will include more tactical movement

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.660 
and will include more tactical movement
with<00:02:31.280> less<00:02:31.519> players

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
with less players

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.920 
with less players
now<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.819> don't<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:33.390> we're<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> be

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
now I don't think we're going to be

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.170 
now I don't think we're going to be

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250

in a lot of clusterfuck we might be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.410 
in a lot of clusterfuck we might be
