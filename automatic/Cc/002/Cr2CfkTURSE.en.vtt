all<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.110> a1<00:04:09.440> license<00:04:10.069> does<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.459> allow<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.730> to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
all the a1 license does is allow you to

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.870 
all the a1 license does is allow you to
not<00:04:11.720> have<00:04:11.780> L<00:04:12.050> plate<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:12.650> carry<00:04:12.950> passengers<00:04:13.190> it

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
not have L plate and carry passengers it

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.479 
not have L plate and carry passengers it
doesn't<00:04:14.180> allow<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.510> ride<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.720> bigger<00:04:14.989> bike

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
doesn't allow you to ride a bigger bike

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.409 
doesn't allow you to ride a bigger bike
so<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.609> basically<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:16.970> waste<00:04:17.150> of<00:04:17.239> time

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
so it's basically a waste of time

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.250 
so it's basically a waste of time
because<00:04:18.609> 500<00:04:19.609> quid<00:04:19.820> is<00:04:19.940> not<00:04:20.090> worth<00:04:20.299> gentleman

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
because 500 quid is not worth gentleman

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.659 
because 500 quid is not worth gentleman
you<00:04:21.380> I'll<00:04:21.530> fight<00:04:21.769> you<00:04:21.919> no<00:04:22.040> I<00:04:22.070> would<00:04:22.340> not<00:04:22.460> pay

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
you I'll fight you no I would not pay

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.430 
you I'll fight you no I would not pay
someone<00:04:22.940> 500<00:04:23.480> quid<00:04:23.660> for<00:04:23.810> me<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.020> get<00:04:24.139> rid<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.320> my

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
someone 500 quid for me to get rid of my

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.590 
someone 500 quid for me to get rid of my
l-bayt<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:24.950> how<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.790> rode<00:04:26.000> around<00:04:26.030> without<00:04:26.419> all

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
l-bayt so how I rode around without all

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.210 
l-bayt so how I rode around without all
plates<00:04:26.870> for<00:04:27.080> six<00:04:27.500> months<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:27.980> it's<00:04:28.070> no

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
plates for six months and it's no

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.550 
plates for six months and it's no
different<00:04:28.639> really<00:04:28.780> apart<00:04:29.780> from<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.169> get<00:04:30.320> nods

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
different really apart from you get nods

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.960 
different really apart from you get nods
from<00:04:30.770> bigger<00:04:30.979> bikes<00:04:31.190> that's<00:04:31.550> it

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
from bigger bikes that's it

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.400 
from bigger bikes that's it
because<00:04:32.600> they<00:04:32.960> don't<00:04:33.139> think<00:04:33.290> you're<00:04:33.380> a

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
because they don't think you're a

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.520 
because they don't think you're a
learner<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.570> they<00:04:35.570> not<00:04:35.750> at<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:36.050> but<00:04:36.320> when<00:04:36.440> you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
learner and they not at you but when you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.659 
learner and they not at you but when you
get<00:04:36.620> out<00:04:36.680> later<00:04:37.010> on<00:04:37.130> they<00:04:37.250> don't<00:04:37.370> because

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
get out later on they don't because

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.370 
get out later on they don't because
you're<00:04:37.760> thinking<00:04:38.090> how<00:04:38.180> you're<00:04:38.360> new<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:42.229> yeah

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
you're thinking how you're new so yeah

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.740 
you're thinking how you're new so yeah
once<00:04:42.710> you're<00:04:42.950> 17<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.729> do<00:04:43.820> your<00:04:43.970> a1<00:04:44.300> licence

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
once you're 17 you do your a1 licence

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.640 
once you're 17 you do your a1 licence
basically<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.139> waste<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.440> money<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:47.440> if<00:04:48.440> you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
basically a waste of money so if you

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.530 
basically a waste of money so if you
actually<00:04:48.800> want<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.130> do<00:04:49.250> your<00:04:49.400> next<00:04:49.520> test<00:04:49.910> to

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
actually want to do your next test to

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.450 
actually want to do your next test to
get<00:04:50.690> something<00:04:51.110> decent<00:04:51.290> then<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.250> have<00:04:52.340> to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
get something decent then you have to

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.030 
get something decent then you have to
wait<00:04:52.550> till<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:52.760> 19<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.570> then<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.650> can<00:04:54.860> ride

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
wait till you 19 and then you can ride

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.960 
wait till you 19 and then you can ride
up<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.600> 47<00:04:56.600> brake<00:04:56.780> horsepower<00:04:57.200> bike<00:04:57.970> there

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
up to a 47 brake horsepower bike there

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.550 
up to a 47 brake horsepower bike there
are<00:04:59.120> more<00:04:59.360> restrictions<00:04:59.900> on<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.139> just<00:05:00.290> having

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
are more restrictions on it just having

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.050 
are more restrictions on it just having
47<00:05:01.130> brake<00:05:01.280> horsepower<00:05:03.490> but<00:05:04.490> basically<00:05:04.880> you

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
47 brake horsepower but basically you

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.690 
47 brake horsepower but basically you
hit<00:05:05.240> 19<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:05.960> do<00:05:06.140> another<00:05:06.440> test<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:07.070> theory<00:05:07.520> and

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
hit 19 you do another test in theory and

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.360 
hit 19 you do another test in theory and
stuff<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.990> then<00:05:09.289> you're<00:05:09.440> allowed<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.620> 47<00:05:10.220> brake

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
stuff and then you're allowed a 47 brake

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.640 
stuff and then you're allowed a 47 brake
horsepower<00:05:10.850> it's<00:05:11.210> got<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.600> have<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:12.470> right

horsepower it's got to have a the right

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.080 
horsepower it's got to have a the right
power-to-weight<00:05:13.100> ratio<00:05:13.729> and<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:16.580> also

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
power-to-weight ratio and you also

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.029 
power-to-weight ratio and you also
allowed<00:05:18.910> you're<00:05:19.910> allowed<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.210> bypass<00:05:20.390> up<00:05:20.780> to

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
92 or 3 brake horsepower and restrict it

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.840 
92 or 3 brake horsepower and restrict it
it<00:05:24.680> can't<00:05:24.950> be<00:05:25.039> more<00:05:25.250> than<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.640> can't

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
it can't be more than that you can't

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.360 
it can't be more than that you can't
restrict<00:05:26.150> a<00:05:26.330> bike<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.990> half<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.740> its<00:05:27.860> original

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
restrict a bike to half of its original

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.750 
restrict a bike to half of its original
factory<00:05:28.789> power<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:31.280> you<00:05:31.370> can't<00:05:31.550> have<00:05:31.669> a

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
factory power so you can't have a

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.820 
factory power so you can't have a
hundred<00:05:32.000> horsepower<00:05:32.450> brick<00:05:32.930> by

hundred horsepower brick by

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.989 
hundred horsepower brick by
I'm<00:05:35.830> restricting<00:05:36.430> because<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:36.639> can<00:05:36.789> only

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:36.999 
I'm restricting because you can only

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.600 
I'm restricting because you can only
restrict<00:05:37.389> that<00:05:37.539> up<00:05:37.719> to<00:05:37.990> 50<00:05:38.979> brake<00:05:39.159> horsepower

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
restrict that up to 50 brake horsepower

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.100 
restrict that up to 50 brake horsepower
which<00:05:39.819> isn't<00:05:40.150> legal<00:05:42.449> got<00:05:43.449> a<00:05:43.479> knot<00:05:43.689> there

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
which isn't legal got a knot there

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.019 
which isn't legal got a knot there
L<00:05:44.650> plates<00:05:44.919> on<00:05:45.159> so<00:05:45.339> it's<00:05:45.490> strange<00:05:45.699> will<00:05:45.939> this

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
L plates on so it's strange will this

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.300 
L plates on so it's strange will this
guy<00:05:46.210> not<00:05:46.389> me<00:05:46.749> yep

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.980 

so<00:05:51.310> yeah<00:05:51.460> once<00:05:51.730> you've<00:05:51.940> got<00:05:52.120> your<00:05:52.150> 46<00:05:52.750> brake

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
so yeah once you've got your 46 brake

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.140 
so yeah once you've got your 46 brake
horsepower<00:05:53.440> license<00:05:53.980> you're<00:05:54.190> a<00:05:54.220> 2<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.910> stay

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
horsepower license you're a 2 you stay

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.880 
horsepower license you're a 2 you stay
on<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.390> for<00:05:55.450> two<00:05:55.630> years<00:05:56.110> and<00:05:56.410> then<00:05:56.560> you<00:05:56.740> can

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
on that for two years and then you can

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.820 
on that for two years and then you can
take<00:05:57.100> your<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.640> license<00:05:58.350> which<00:05:59.350> then<00:05:59.590> allows

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
take your a license which then allows

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.810 
take your a license which then allows
you<00:06:00.070> to<00:06:00.340> ride<00:06:00.580> whatever<00:06:00.940> you<00:06:01.180> want

you to ride whatever you want
so<00:06:03.420> in<00:06:03.570> theory<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:07.110> earliest<00:06:07.710> that<00:06:07.800> you<00:06:07.920> can

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
so in theory the earliest that you can

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.980 
so in theory the earliest that you can
ride<00:06:08.280> a<00:06:08.310> motorbike

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990
