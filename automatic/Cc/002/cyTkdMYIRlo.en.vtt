00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.510
 today we will sing chocolate cake for 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.330
 the basics of this cake we need 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.850
 cheeks usual biscuits here I took 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.630
 is chocolate pea cookies 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.240
 called 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.150
 for a half pack of cookies that I already 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.410
 milled we need about 150 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.360
 gram of butter 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.780
 melted and for filling us 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.940
 will need 400 grams 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.500
 three and four hundred black chocolate 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.059
 In principle, it is not so important depends on 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.510
 what degree of saturation you 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.110
 prefer half a liter cream 3 eggs 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.809
 a pinch of salt and vanilla sugar while it 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.400
 we will need to start we will 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:59.420
 do naturally the basis for our 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.519
 pie do it said loudly all that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.070
 we only need to grind it into small 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.040
 baby using a blender or when 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.140
 help just plain rolling pins 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.180
 cookie and pour it 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.159
 melted butter it 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.470
 quite typical basis for very 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.570
 of many 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.510
 pies including almost all cheesecakes 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.550
 are made this way all of us that us 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.060
 you only need to mix and our dough 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.060
 is ready 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.510
 you can add measles here 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.400
 You can add more nuts here too 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.220
 milled fine of course then all 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.670
 it will taste better depends on what you have 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:54.770
 there is a presence and how you love this one 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:59.450
 crumb pour form the bottom of which I 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.220
 put paper 1 paper on it then 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.670
 then you can just 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.830
 will cut and neatly 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.830
 knead on the bottom and sides 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.569
 using a cup with a flat bottom 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.790
 we do but much more even 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.670
 easier than just hands of course 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.819
 it is desirable that the bottom be sent as 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.310
 can be more evenly then on the cut 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.860
 the pie will be no more beautiful effect 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.860
 look basically except see 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.200
 on the look it is no longer on anything 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.519
 will affect 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.709
 Our base is now ready for 10 minutes 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.769
 or at least for that word for 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.930
 time while we are preparing the stuffing we remove in 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.510
 fridge for cream filling we 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.480
 warm up to the first bulek sings later 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.340
 give them cool degrees to 5 10 not 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.560
 more because chocolate will not be very 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.730
 high temperature 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:16.239
 add here cream vanilla chocolate 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.489
 sugar and salt now we need it all 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.010
 stir until dissolved 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.650
 chocolate 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.650
 the mass should be smooth and shiny 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.659
 and sugar and salt and chocolate we have completely 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.930
 dissolved 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:38.599
 Now we can add one by one here. 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.049
 eggs on so that it was more convenient to take 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.049
 whisk 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.590
 all our filling for chocolate cake 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.159
 ready again for special lovers 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.989
 can you add nuts here but honestly 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:22.199
 say on the cut then it won't be like 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:24.870
 I like to watch more from the filling 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:30.860
 ready all we have left now in 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.860
 chilled cake pour over the filling 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.330
 and remove bake 180 degrees on 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.330
 25 minutes 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.410
 Here is our cake after baking 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.180
 I baked them for half an hour before 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.040
 states are unfortunately very hot 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.890
 that's when you move it a little bit 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.020
 the middle twitches a little pie ready 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.850
 we can only wait when we 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.320
 on the stage that my could decorate 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.520
 and further we will clean it in 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.520
 fridge to add 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.160
 our cake has cooled down exactly so much that we 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.110
 we can decorate it 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.669
 Here you can see that due to the oil is very easy 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.410
 this cake gets out of shape we 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.010
 I'll get it already just before 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.870
 the very filing now I just expensive 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.660
 I carry the final touches so to speak 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.910
 You can decorate or sprinkle on top 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.710
 powdered sugar either in gulf chocolate 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.790
 hail icing very much in that much 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.960
 no of course but no 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:43.280
 I will not be too much 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.280
 it is very easy to excel 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.650
 here stick a small rosette which 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:58.400
 made of mastic 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.400
 a little fresh mint 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:13.450
 and a little bit of sugar 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.150
 powders now we need to cool this 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.540
 four hours menu pie in the fridge still 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.810
 better to leave it for the night and enjoy 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.810
 your appetite
