another video today in this video which
counts<00:00:14.510> for<00:00:14.570> taking<00:00:14.930> a<00:00:15.019> in-depth<00:00:15.500> look<00:00:15.769> and<00:00:16.039> a

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
counts for taking a in-depth look and a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.430 
counts for taking a in-depth look and a
detailed<00:00:16.850> analysis<00:00:17.660> at<00:00:17.900> one<00:00:18.170> of<00:00:18.289> the

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
detailed analysis at one of the

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.680 
detailed analysis at one of the
generation<00:00:19.130> challenges<00:00:19.730> from<00:00:20.119> generation

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
generation challenges from generation

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.689 
generation challenges from generation
three<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:21.230> four<00:00:21.530> is<00:00:21.710> this<00:00:21.860> probably<00:00:22.190> the<00:00:22.340> first

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
three to four is this probably the first

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.490 
three to four is this probably the first
challenge<00:00:23.119> you<00:00:23.180> come<00:00:23.449> across<00:00:23.690> when<00:00:24.080> going

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
challenge you come across when going

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.470 
challenge you come across when going
from<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:24.949> first<00:00:25.279> 50<00:00:25.580> levels<00:00:25.910> upwards<00:00:26.359> just

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
from the first 50 levels upwards just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.060 
from the first 50 levels upwards just
because<00:00:26.900> it's<00:00:27.050> probably<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.470> first<00:00:27.710> most

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
because it's probably the first most

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.070 
because it's probably the first most
time-consuming<00:00:28.340> challenge<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:29.390> get<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:29.840> just

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
time-consuming challenge you get to just

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720 
time-consuming challenge you get to just
before<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:30.500> get<00:00:30.650> to<00:00:30.740> other<00:00:30.890> time-consuming

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
before you get to other time-consuming

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.849 
before you get to other time-consuming
challenges<00:00:32.390> like<00:00:32.659> the<00:00:32.809> goose'<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:33.829> I

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
challenges like the goose' and so I

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.200 
challenges like the goose' and so I
thought<00:00:34.069> I<00:00:34.100> put<00:00:34.399> a<00:00:34.429> video<00:00:34.579> out<00:00:34.850> because<00:00:35.059> this

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
thought I put a video out because this

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.880 
thought I put a video out because this
take<00:00:35.479> me<00:00:35.600> quite<00:00:35.809> a<00:00:35.929> long<00:00:36.109> time<00:00:36.319> to<00:00:36.379> get<00:00:36.710> because

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
take me quite a long time to get because

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.160 
take me quite a long time to get because
you<00:00:36.979> have<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.190> get<00:00:37.339> 50<00:00:37.699> kills<00:00:38.030> with<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.539> Titan

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.379 
you have to get 50 kills with the Titan
weapon<00:00:39.679> known<00:00:39.979> as<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.159> plasma<00:00:40.579> railgun

weapon known as the plasma railgun

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:43.689 
weapon known as the plasma railgun
so<00:00:41.569> there's<00:00:41.749> definitely<00:00:42.460> millions<00:00:43.460> and

12<00:01:12.080> Titans<00:01:12.590> 10<00:01:12.950> Titans<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> map<00:01:13.850> all<00:01:14.090> at

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
12 Titans 10 Titans on the map all at

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.000 
12 Titans 10 Titans on the map all at
once<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.750> it's<00:01:14.960> just<00:01:15.140> very<00:01:15.320> very<00:01:15.440> easy<00:01:15.770> to

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
once and it's just very very easy to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.440 
once and it's just very very easy to
pick<00:01:16.130> up<00:01:16.220> tying<00:01:16.520> kills<00:01:16.820> just<00:01:17.030> because<00:01:17.330> you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
pick up tying kills just because you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.030 
pick up tying kills just because you
don't<00:01:17.690> have<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.960> wait<00:01:18.200> for<00:01:18.230> people<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.740> call<00:01:18.980> in

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
don't have to wait for people to call in

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.920 
don't have to wait for people to call in
their<00:01:19.310> Titans<00:01:19.730> because<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.210> start<00:01:20.570> in<00:01:20.750> them

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
their Titans because you start in them

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.660 
their Titans because you start in them
so<00:01:21.140> that's<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.470> course<00:01:21.770> definitely<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.460> game

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
so that's of course definitely the game

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.520 
so that's of course definitely the game
mode<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.000> want<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.270> play<00:01:23.510> moving<00:01:23.840> on<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
mode you want to play moving on to the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.770 
mode you want to play moving on to the
loadout<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.340> my<00:01:25.550> loader<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:26.150> used<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.690> get

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
loadout this is my loader I used to get

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.600 
loadout this is my loader I used to get
the<00:01:26.870> 50<00:01:27.170> kills<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.590> got<00:01:27.770> them<00:01:27.950> very<00:01:28.340> very

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
the 50 kills I got them very very

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.040 
the 50 kills I got them very very
quickly<00:01:28.940> much<00:01:29.330> quicker<00:01:29.570> than<00:01:29.690> I<00:01:29.870> actually

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
quickly much quicker than I actually

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.200 
quickly much quicker than I actually
realized<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.010> that's<00:01:31.460> why<00:01:31.670> I'm<00:01:31.850> probably

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
realized and that's why I'm probably

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.880 
realized and that's why I'm probably

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.600 
and your certain type of Titan that you
choose<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.200> course<00:01:42.440> not<00:01:42.800> everyone<00:01:43.070> has<00:01:43.370> all

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
choose so of course not everyone has all

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.370 
choose so of course not everyone has all
of<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.850> Titans<00:01:44.270> unlocked<00:01:44.750> depending<00:01:45.260> on

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
of the Titans unlocked depending on

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.200 
of the Titans unlocked depending on
whether<00:01:45.590> you've<00:01:45.800> completed<00:01:46.250> both<00:01:46.370> sides<00:01:46.909> of

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
whether you've completed both sides of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.149 
whether you've completed both sides of
the<00:01:47.390> campaign<00:01:47.900> multiplayer<00:01:48.500> for<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.890> militia

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
the campaign multiplayer for the militia

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.250 
the campaign multiplayer for the militia
and<00:01:49.490> IMC<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.630> most<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.050> guys<00:01:51.200> will

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
and IMC so most of you guys will

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.080 
and IMC so most of you guys will
probably<00:01:51.710> be<00:01:51.830> starting<00:01:52.250> off<00:01:52.370> with<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.700> Atlas

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
probably be starting off with the Atlas

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.149 
probably be starting off with the Atlas
even<00:01:53.540> if<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:53.840> have<00:01:54.080> unlocked<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.620> eva<00:01:54.980> the

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
even if you have unlocked the eva the

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.830 
even if you have unlocked the eva the
stride<00:01:55.490> or<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.730> yoga<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.150> still<00:01:56.479> want<00:01:56.780> to

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
stride or the yoga you still want to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.300 
stride or the yoga you still want to
stick<00:01:57.110> with<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.620> Atlas<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.100> you're<00:01:58.190> probably

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
stick with the Atlas and you're probably

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.580 
stick with the Atlas and you're probably
asking<00:01:58.640> me<00:01:59.030> why<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.720> shoot<00:01:59.900> her<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.229> ogre

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
asking me why not shoot her the ogre

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.380 
asking me why not shoot her the ogre
this<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.890> because<00:02:01.250> even<00:02:01.700> though<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.909> ogre<00:02:02.270> has

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
this is because even though the ogre has

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.120 
this is because even though the ogre has
got<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.570> better<00:02:02.840> shield<00:02:03.260> it's<00:02:03.530> got<00:02:03.710> more<00:02:03.860> health

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
got a better shield it's got more health

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.640 
got a better shield it's got more health
compared<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.060> Alice<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.630> also<00:02:06.140> its<00:02:06.320> core

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
compared to the Alice and also its core

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.289 
compared to the Alice and also its core
ability<00:02:07.070> gives<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.430> more<00:02:07.580> health<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.149> lot

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
ability gives it more health and a lot

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.879 
ability gives it more health and a lot
of<00:02:08.359> people<00:02:08.659> would<00:02:08.810> kind<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.319> argue<00:02:09.739> with

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:09.889 
of people would kind of like argue with

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.440 
of people would kind of like argue with
me<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.189> say<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.939> more<00:02:11.120> health<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.420> have

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
me and say that the more health you have

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.420 
me and say that the more health you have
the<00:02:11.810> more<00:02:12.049> longer<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.530> survive<00:02:12.709> for<00:02:13.159> getting

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the more longer you survive for getting

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.930 
the more longer you survive for getting
kills

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
kills

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.610 
kills
however<00:02:14.300> what<00:02:14.540> makes<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.930> Atlas<00:02:15.230> such<00:02:15.440> a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
however what makes the Atlas such a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.860 
however what makes the Atlas such a
important<00:02:16.250> decision<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.910> reason<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.630> choose

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
important decision and reason to choose

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.810 
important decision and reason to choose
it<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.410> your<00:02:18.530> loadout<00:02:18.890> it's<00:02:19.100> because<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
it for your loadout it's because of the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.790 
it for your loadout it's because of the
core<00:02:20.120> ability<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.900> comes<00:02:21.140> with<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.470> Atlas

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
core ability that comes with the Atlas

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.870 
core ability that comes with the Atlas
so<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.040> know<00:02:22.190> all<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.490> Titans<00:02:22.790> have

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
so you know all the Titans have

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.730 
so you know all the Titans have
different<00:02:23.180> core<00:02:23.390> abilities<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.110> Alice<00:02:24.470> has

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
different core abilities the Alice has

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.650 
different core abilities the Alice has
damaged<00:02:25.220> core<00:02:25.490> which<00:02:25.670> definitely<00:02:26.240> helps<00:02:26.540> out

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
damaged core which definitely helps out

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.060 
damaged core which definitely helps out
with<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.960> challenge<00:02:27.350> because<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.770> gives<00:02:27.950> you

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
with the challenge because it gives you

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.250 
with the challenge because it gives you
an<00:02:28.220> extra<00:02:28.580> boost<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.120> damage<00:02:29.540> points<00:02:29.900> against

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
an extra boost in damage points against

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.020 
an extra boost in damage points against
titans<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.070> when<00:02:31.310> you're<00:02:31.460> using<00:02:31.610> New<00:02:31.880> York

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.160 
lost their shield you will take them
down<00:02:36.650> very<00:02:36.920> very<00:02:37.310> quickly<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.360> moving<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:38.960> to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
down very very quickly so moving on to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.020 
down very very quickly so moving on to
the<00:02:39.290> attachment<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.070> use<00:02:40.340> with<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.610> plasma

the attachment I use with the plasma

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.520 
the attachment I use with the plasma
railgun<00:02:41.150> there's<00:02:41.600> only<00:02:41.720> two<00:02:42.020> but<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.320> still

railgun there's only two but we still

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.900 
railgun there's only two but we still
need<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.800> cover<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.370> there's<00:02:43.520> even<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
need to cover it so there's even the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.600 
need to cover it so there's even the
extended<00:02:44.420> mags<00:02:44.660> or<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.110> instant<00:02:45.710> shot<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.280> have

the instant shot equipped I've played

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
the instant shot equipped I've played
with<00:02:48.710> both<00:02:48.920> attachments<00:02:49.820> just<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.180> see<00:02:50.360> which

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
with both attachments just to see which

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.630 
with both attachments just to see which
one<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> usually<00:02:51.260> prefer<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.070> do<00:02:52.130> prefer<00:02:52.610> the

one I usually prefer and I do prefer the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.580 
one I usually prefer and I do prefer the
instant<00:02:53.120> shot<00:02:53.360> for<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> multiple<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.080> reasons

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
instant shot for a multiple of reasons

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 
instant shot for a multiple of reasons
does<00:02:54.830> cut<00:02:55.220> your<00:02:55.430> damage<00:02:55.850> in<00:02:56.060> half<00:02:56.360> bit<00:02:56.660> it

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
does cut your damage in half bit it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.560 
does cut your damage in half bit it
definitely<00:02:57.410> speeds<00:02:57.920> up<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:58.670> fire<00:02:59.270> rate

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
definitely speeds up your fire rate

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.850 
definitely speeds up your fire rate
which<00:02:59.810> definitely<00:03:00.200> makes<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.680> lot<00:03:00.800> easier

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
which definitely makes it a lot easier

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.860 
which definitely makes it a lot easier
to<00:03:01.310> get<00:03:01.370> kills<00:03:01.730> with<00:03:01.850> because<00:03:02.270> as<00:03:02.450> soon<00:03:02.600> as<00:03:02.660> you

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
to get kills with because as soon as you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.050 
to get kills with because as soon as you
take<00:03:03.110> out<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.530> enemy<00:03:03.860> Titan<00:03:04.280> shield<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.760> few

take out the enemy Titan shield a few
shots<00:03:05.300> from<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.960> you'll<00:03:06.110> get<00:03:06.260> an<00:03:06.410> extra

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
shots from this and you'll get an extra

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.560 
shots from this and you'll get an extra
kill<00:03:06.920> towards<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.490> challenge<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.150> moving<00:03:08.420> on

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
kill towards the challenge so moving on

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.420 
kill towards the challenge so moving on
is<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.900> tactical<00:03:09.380> ability<00:03:09.830> that's<00:03:10.070> probably

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
is the tactical ability that's probably

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.160 
is the tactical ability that's probably
down<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.640> personal<00:03:11.000> preference<00:03:11.510> just<00:03:11.780> because

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
down to personal preference just because

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.390 
down to personal preference just because
there's<00:03:12.380> not<00:03:12.470> many<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.830> choose<00:03:12.860> from

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
there's not many to choose from

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.520 
there's not many to choose from
however<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.030> tactical<00:03:14.570> ability<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.930> find<00:03:15.380> the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
however the tactical ability I find the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.770 
however the tactical ability I find the
most<00:03:15.740> useful<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.310> definitely<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.120> particle

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
most useful is definitely the particle

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.750 
most useful is definitely the particle
walk<00:03:17.989> this<00:03:18.230> deploy<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.920> one-way<00:03:19.430> force

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
walk this deploy is a one-way force

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.520 
walk this deploy is a one-way force
field<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.209> when<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:20.360> find<00:03:20.750> I'm<00:03:21.020> in<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.320> situation

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.410 
field so when I find I'm in a situation
where<00:03:22.010> my<00:03:22.160> shields<00:03:22.550> gone<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.209> actually

where my shields gone and I actually

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.000 
where my shields gone and I actually
need<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.810> get<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.020> few<00:03:24.200> kills<00:03:24.440> with<00:03:24.739> plasma

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
need to get a few kills with plasma

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.710 
need to get a few kills with plasma
railgun<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.730> course<00:03:26.030> for<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.239> challenge<00:03:26.600> and

railgun of course for the challenge and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.360 
railgun of course for the challenge and
it's<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.900> few<00:03:27.050> times<00:03:27.320> which<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.800> can<00:03:27.980> get<00:03:28.100> kills

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
it's a few times which I can get kills

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.070 
it's a few times which I can get kills
off<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.730> front<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.060> me<00:03:29.150> but<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.600> don't<00:03:29.660> have<00:03:29.930> my

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
shield time I'm obviously very very

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.790 
shield time I'm obviously very very
vulnerable<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.540> place<00:03:32.840> down<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.260> shield<00:03:33.590> and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
vulnerable I place down the shield and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.070 
vulnerable I place down the shield and
any<00:03:34.130> damage<00:03:34.580> coming<00:03:34.820> at<00:03:35.030> me<00:03:35.180> will<00:03:35.450> get<00:03:35.780> blocked

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
any damage coming at me will get blocked

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080 
any damage coming at me will get blocked
it<00:03:36.380> won't<00:03:36.590> affect<00:03:36.920> me<00:03:37.130> whatsoever<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:37.820> I<00:03:37.880> can

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
it won't affect me whatsoever but I can

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.210 
it won't affect me whatsoever but I can
still<00:03:38.390> deal<00:03:38.690> full<00:03:39.140> normal<00:03:39.620> damage<00:03:39.830> through

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
still deal full normal damage through

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.890 
still deal full normal damage through
the<00:03:40.400> shield<00:03:40.670> which<00:03:40.880> definitely<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.690> a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
the shield which definitely is a

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.960 
the shield which definitely is a
advantage<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.980> because<00:03:43.070> if<00:03:43.430> depending<00:03:43.730> on

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
advantage just because if depending on

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.670 
advantage just because if depending on
the<00:03:44.090> situation<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.080> scenario

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
the situation in this scenario

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.710 
the situation in this scenario
moving<00:03:46.220> on<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.489> my<00:03:46.640> ordnance<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:47.420> is<00:03:47.570> a

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
moving on is my ordnance this is a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.229 
moving on is my ordnance this is a
cluster<00:03:48.050> missile<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.950> sustained<00:03:49.489> explosions

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
cluster missile a sustained explosions

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.100 
cluster missile a sustained explosions
on<00:03:50.450> impact

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
on impact

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.240 
on impact
I<00:03:51.140> believe<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.620> probably<00:03:51.830> one<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.190> the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
I believe this is probably one of the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.949 
I believe this is probably one of the
most<00:03:52.400> favorite<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.030> death<00:03:53.360> from<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.660> again

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
most favorite and death from the again

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.720 
most favorite and death from the again
down<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.170> personal<00:03:54.410> preference<00:03:54.830> of<00:03:55.190> myself

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
down to personal preference of myself

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.699 
down to personal preference of myself
but<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.000> custom<00:03:56.450> missile<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:57.050> definitely

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
but the custom missile is definitely

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.490 
but the custom missile is definitely
very<00:03:58.190> very<00:03:58.280> useful<00:03:59.000> in<00:03:59.209> any<00:03:59.570> situation<00:04:00.470> you

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
very very useful in any situation you

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.920 
very very useful in any situation you
can<00:04:00.830> use<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.430> stop<00:04:01.790> paths<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.420> titans

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
can use it to stop paths of titans

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.990 
can use it to stop paths of titans
coming<00:04:03.260> towards<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:04.070> can<00:04:04.310> use<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.880> get

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
coming towards you you can use it to get

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.940 
coming towards you you can use it to get
Titans<00:04:05.510> into<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> certain<00:04:06.230> place<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.709> map

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
Titans into a certain place of the map

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.590 
Titans into a certain place of the map
that<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.190> want<00:04:07.489> them<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.730> just<00:04:08.150> because<00:04:08.390> if

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
that you want them to just because if

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.030 
that you want them to just because if
they<00:04:08.720> try<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.050> walk<00:04:09.350> through<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.800> they<00:04:09.950> will

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
they try to walk through it they will

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.590 
they try to walk through it they will
just<00:04:10.220> get<00:04:10.370> blown<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.640> smithereens<00:04:10.970> and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
just get blown to smithereens and

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.970 
just get blown to smithereens and
they're<00:04:11.750> all<00:04:11.959> their<00:04:12.170> shield<00:04:12.470> will<00:04:12.650> be<00:04:12.769> gone

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
they're all their shield will be gone

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.530 
they're all their shield will be gone
and<00:04:13.160> probably<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.610> health<00:04:13.820> as<00:04:14.000> well<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.480> the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
and probably the health as well so the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.240 
and probably the health as well so the
custom<00:04:14.870> missile<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.260> very<00:04:15.500> very<00:04:15.680> useful<00:04:15.890> for

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
custom missile is very very useful for

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.830 
custom missile is very very useful for
the<00:04:16.340> challenge<00:04:16.730> for<00:04:17.060> using<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.480> plasma

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
the challenge for using the plasma

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.509 
the challenge for using the plasma
railgun<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.320> get<00:04:18.470> kills<00:04:18.739> because<00:04:18.980> you<00:04:19.220> can<00:04:19.370> use

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
railgun to get kills because you can use

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.430 
railgun to get kills because you can use
the<00:04:19.669> cost<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.180> missile<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.750> take<00:04:20.780> out<00:04:21.230> the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
the cost of the missile to take out the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.620 
the cost of the missile to take out the
Titans<00:04:22.010> shield<00:04:22.370> use<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.820> particle<00:04:23.180> wall<00:04:23.479> if

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
Titans shield use the particle wall if

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.390 
Titans shield use the particle wall if
you<00:04:23.780> need<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.260> protect<00:04:24.500> yourself<00:04:25.160> with

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
you need to to protect yourself with

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.100 
you need to to protect yourself with
their<00:04:25.610> shield<00:04:25.910> down<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.300> can<00:04:26.419> easily<00:04:26.630> like<00:04:26.990> I

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
their shield down you can easily like I

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.670 
their shield down you can easily like I
said<00:04:27.350> with<00:04:27.500> the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
said with the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.499 
said with the
instance<00:04:28.039> shot<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.520> plasma<00:04:28.880> railgun<00:04:29.000> take

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
instance shot the plasma railgun take

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:30.999 
instance shot the plasma railgun take
them<00:04:29.690> out<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.080> swift<00:04:30.320> kill<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.889> that's

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
them out for a swift kill and that's

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.950 
them out for a swift kill and that's
probably<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.430> best<00:04:31.850> weapon<00:04:32.389> tactical

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960

moving<00:04:37.310> on<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.460> kits<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:38.000> eat<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.360> tactical

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
moving on to kits I eat the tactical

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.719 
moving on to kits I eat the tactical
reactor<00:04:39.380> which<00:04:39.590> your<00:04:39.830> Titan<00:04:40.220> tactical

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
reactor which your Titan tactical

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.640 
reactor which your Titan tactical
ability<00:04:41.120> recharge<00:04:41.570> it's<00:04:41.720> much<00:04:41.900> faster<00:04:42.169> of

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
ability recharge it's much faster of

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.499 
ability recharge it's much faster of
course<00:04:42.979> being<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.280> particle<00:04:43.850> Walter<00:04:44.360> we've

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
course being the particle Walter we've

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.900 
course being the particle Walter we've
got<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.900> move<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.710> self-defense<00:04:46.430> against

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
got a move of self-defense against

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.060 
got a move of self-defense against
ourselves<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.720> then<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.990> second<00:04:48.410> tier<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.680> use

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
ourselves and then the second tier I use

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.580 
ourselves and then the second tier I use
of<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.490> kit<00:04:49.729> too<00:04:50.000> if<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.419> core<00:04:50.750> extender<00:04:51.440> so

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
of the kit too if the core extender so

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.370 
of the kit too if the core extender so
my<00:04:51.949> Titan<00:04:52.460> core<00:04:52.669> my<00:04:52.820> damaged<00:04:53.150> core<00:04:53.389> lasts<00:04:54.229> a

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
my Titan core my damaged core lasts a

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.810 
my Titan core my damaged core lasts a
lot<00:04:54.620> longer<00:04:54.680> because<00:04:55.250> most<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.639> time

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
lot longer because most of the time

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.820 
lot longer because most of the time

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
got the damaged core going on from much

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.520 
got the damaged core going on from much
longer<00:05:02.090> which<00:05:02.270> gives<00:05:02.509> you<00:05:02.660> extra<00:05:02.690> damage<00:05:03.320> of
