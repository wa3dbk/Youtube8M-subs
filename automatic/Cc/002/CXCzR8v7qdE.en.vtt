00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.819
 but I like to paint 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.309
 of course 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.829
 but have already stopped to imagine what these drawings will be like in 1 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.969
 two of the 50 years 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.449
 We probably need a refurb. 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.579
 because that's more or less what's happening with the war and peace panels 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.359
 painted by the brazilian artist Candido Portinari for more than half 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.960
 century 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.580
 over time if things were losing signal strength 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.390
 now an installation is being made in Rio de Janeiro promises to rescue all 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.930
 colorful artwork 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.810
 the idea in the articles to color again pictures but if these are the 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.040
 and removable to do this work 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040
 We're not going here. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.240
 a lot of feedback 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.210
 in three years we will not use our paints on portinari 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.180
 we are not at nine mills 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.870
 removable translucent 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.930
 only to recover the intensity of the crosses 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.040
 the resistance of the transparent passes and tie the colors in block 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 because you know that this is a way to guarantee the preservation of works of art. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.680
 without changing the way the artist painted 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.360
 This time it does not get wet. 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.220
 Paint again 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.150
 she wears turan pretty much like you left a drop of 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.830
 karen acioly olive oil 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.040
 in that place where it fell the oil gets darker 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.840
 according to the strongest 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.640
 It's more or less so. 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.050
 the season promises to be laborious 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.320
 after all the panels war and peace is 14 meters high and weighs more than two 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.640
 tons 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.900
 but if you think that just being two professionals is involved in this 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.920
 assignment 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.260
 you're wrong 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.510
 in the installation workshop also at 20 10 3 as here measurement of the mind that 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.100
 open up such art knowledge using special equipment 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
 picture with son 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.609
 anyway can also help 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.999
 to solve which would best fit 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.609
 the choral team 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.609
 due to little movement 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.559
 and was defeated you should not have noticed 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.819
 want to see close-up restoration work from the beginning and 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.089
 closure 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:31.949
 then there is the gustavian capanema palace in rio de janeiro until May 20 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.479
 you will find furniture and personal objects from Candido Portinari o 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.319
 microscope planned to ask for detail 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.849
 and last month captive I reflected on war and the country
