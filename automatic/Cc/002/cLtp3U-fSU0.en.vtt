Jews I mean it might be only one that
got<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.819> vibe<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:05.340> don't<00:01:06.340> know<00:01:06.579> who<00:01:06.880> wrote

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
got that vibe I don't know who wrote

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.880 
got that vibe I don't know who wrote
this<00:01:07.479> but<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.490> might<00:01:09.909> wanted<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:11.409> might<00:01:11.649> have

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
this but you might wanted you might have

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.710 
this but you might wanted you might have
wanted<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.250> reword<00:01:12.790> some<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.450> stuff

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
wanted to reword some of the stuff

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.020 
wanted to reword some of the stuff
because<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.439> was<00:01:14.619> like<00:01:14.920> kicking<00:01:15.130> entire<00:01:15.640> race

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
because it was like kicking entire race

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
because it was like kicking entire race
in<00:01:16.689> this<00:01:17.110> case<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.500> species<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:19.360> of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
in this case of species and kind of

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.730 
in this case of species and kind of
really<00:01:20.799> spending<00:01:21.159> them<00:01:21.340> on<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.520> bed<00:01:22.530> bad<00:01:23.530> way

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
really spending them on a bed bad way

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.420 
really spending them on a bed bad way
like<00:01:23.770> if<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:24.729> was<00:01:24.939> a<00:01:24.969> group<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.799> people<00:01:26.799> there

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
like if this was a group of people there

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.279 
like if this was a group of people there
would<00:01:27.579> be<00:01:27.610> no<00:01:28.119> way<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.540> this<00:01:28.659> episode<00:01:29.170> would

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
would be no way that this episode would

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.149 
would be no way that this episode would
ever<00:01:29.530> be<00:01:29.829> able<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.219> air<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.140> was<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:32.890> great

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
ever be able to air but it was so great

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
office only when Gilda came back that

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.880 
office only when Gilda came back that
was<00:01:35.110> amazing<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.680> think<00:01:35.710> she's<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.280> first

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
was amazing I think she's the first

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.719 
was amazing I think she's the first
reoccurring<00:01:38.890> villain<00:01:39.729> um<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:42.340> trying<00:01:42.640> to

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
reoccurring villain um I'm trying to

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.789 
reoccurring villain um I'm trying to
think<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.149> anyone<00:01:43.509> else<00:01:43.630> actually<00:01:44.109> came<00:01:44.560> back

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
think of anyone else actually came back

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.249 
think of anyone else actually came back
I<00:01:45.039> believe<00:01:45.520> she's<00:01:46.000> not<00:01:46.180> really<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.420> villain<00:01:47.049> but

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
I believe she's not really a villain but

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.770 
I believe she's not really a villain but
she<00:01:47.439> wants<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.799> character<00:01:48.250> she's<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.210> first<00:01:49.450> to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
she wants a character she's the first to

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.640 
she wants a character she's the first to
return<00:01:50.320> besides<00:01:50.829> Trixie<00:01:51.609> I<00:01:51.640> believe

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
return besides Trixie I believe

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.340 
return besides Trixie I believe

was actually amazing that scene there

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.979 
was actually amazing that scene there
was<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.860> lot<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.250> stuff<00:03:32.550> done<00:03:32.790> good<00:03:33.030> overall<00:03:33.690> it

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
was a lot of stuff done good overall it

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.870 
was a lot of stuff done good overall it
was<00:03:34.110> like<00:03:34.260> an<00:03:34.380> eight<00:03:34.709> or<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.040> seven<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.850> half

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
was like an eight or a seven and a half

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.960 
was like an eight or a seven and a half
out<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.420> ten<00:03:36.780> make<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.290> may<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:37.950> an<00:03:38.750> 87.8<00:03:40.970> around

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
out of ten make it may be an 87.8 around

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.910 
out of ten make it may be an 87.8 around
there<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.420> was<00:03:42.540> really<00:03:42.870> good<00:03:43.019> he<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
there it was really good he is the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.860 
there it was really good he is the
reason<00:03:44.070> why<00:03:44.340> it's<00:03:44.489> not<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.730> hires<00:03:45.330> because

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
reason why it's not like hires because

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.960 
reason why it's not like hires because
time<00:03:46.170> they<00:03:46.500> have<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.739> rush<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.459> ending<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
time they have to rush the ending the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.880 
time they have to rush the ending the
rush<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.540> endings<00:03:48.930> are<00:03:49.140> always<00:03:49.170> rushed

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
rush the endings are always rushed

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.930 
rush the endings are always rushed
because<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.640> 22<00:03:51.269> minute<00:03:51.799> time<00:03:52.799> slot

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
because they have a 22 minute time slot

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.190 
because they have a 22 minute time slot
you<00:03:53.940> know<00:03:54.060> there's<00:03:54.360> only<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.840> much<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.080> can

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
you know there's only so much you can

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.570 
you know there's only so much you can
put<00:03:55.500> into<00:03:55.680> that

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
put into that

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.510 
put into that
and<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:57.150> sucks<00:03:57.710> but<00:03:58.710> they<00:03:58.980> did<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.490> best

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
and that sucks but they did the best

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.520 
and that sucks but they did the best
they<00:03:59.850> could<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.240> times<00:04:00.840> they<00:04:01.080> were<00:04:01.230> allowed

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
they could with times they were allowed

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.110 
they could with times they were allowed
and<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.850> think<00:04:02.910> overall<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.840> product<00:04:04.230> was

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
and I think overall the product was

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.730 
and I think overall the product was
