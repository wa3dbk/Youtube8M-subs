00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.819
 everyone good if at least once accidentally does not have an ex aequo smoothness and 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.640
 women are the worst in that area 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.940
 according to the singer, she thinks they give way to everything in Groningen alone 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.969
 by victory 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 the entire match 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.630
 at the largest purification plant of our province it can be seen already 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.090
 longer 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.679
 groningen are pretty dirty 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.070
 on a yearly basis, much more is flushed down the toilet than it 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.829
 usual the sea paper hydraulic engineering 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.999
 that Polish condoms are protesting 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.840
 Macaroni 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.600
 the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 from that it can be work as far as we know inside 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.110
 we have listed below are the two women of venus and they will become that anyway 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.090
 to be 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.960
 the stentor ton 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.270
 what's in it 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.270
 and they become many every week 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.760
 the biggest culprit is human hair 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.360
 You probably know it that long two strings when cleaning the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 shower in the floor drain this is 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 and up to the middle east 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.920
 is this already 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.920
 twisted together that turns out to be 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.030
 further on the system that runs even further 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.360
 and eventually it may follow to become a thick cable 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.590
 that has suggested that one on this is no longer 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.900
 an information campaign should be the behavior of toilet use 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.650
 change 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.970
 but also the manufacturers of cleaning wipes in sight is they would 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.210
 must be addressed 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.420
 it is suspected that the items that have ended up are available 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.410
 it would also be a solution 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.130
 well and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.189
 I would of course like to prevent you from being accidentally in the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190
 cleaning bit late 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.730
 that shoots in the toilet 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.330
 I can prevent that 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.090
 but I don't believe there are so many of them 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.430
 it will take years 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.790
 hours before the manufacturers have picked it up the water board realizes 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.230
 That too and can only hope that NRC users especially the Afellay one 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.950
 discover something
