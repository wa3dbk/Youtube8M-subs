00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello youtube today i want to talk about 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.420
 how I installed the compressor for 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 pumping intex cylinders of which you 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.109
 surely all use that is sat down 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.520
 batteries here and the engine yet 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.390
 normal that is, we somehow was 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.260
 revive shorter hide nothing here 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.500
 There is no complicated shorter glue located 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.360
 that is, roughly speaking, take a screwdriver and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.290
 easy to tell movements well 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 broke there no matter shorter opened 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 have opened 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:47.780
 under the hood we observe this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.820
 design 2 nests charging and 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:58.640
 switch between 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.640
 some kind of fee here means filter 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.710
 motor current stabilization but not even 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.790
 the stabilizer is just a filter on the very 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.820
 In fact, there are two terminals worn on 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.430
 directly to the motor terminal 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.430
 engine plus is marked with a red dot 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:26.620
 surely you can see red. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.050
 that is, plus everywhere the red Chinese 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.180
 Well done on the one hand on the other hand 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.500
 made pieces undisposable just glued 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 but not the essence was all crammed inside 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.640
 batteries with these 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.750
 that is, the battery and also unpretentious 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.390
 mounted on new on the glue point between 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.290
 they were between the batteries were 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 so here are some inserts here such here 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.790
 now I stuck them out of here and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.760
 tell further collect it 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.130
 together on screws so that it was 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.710
 collapsible here these inserts they 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.440
 were turned 180 degrees and stood 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.330
 between the battery like a run that is 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.960
 they are glue that's good yes there any glue 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.070
 the moment that's good to sit here 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:24.900
 the engine is alive normally that is to say 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.900
 intex compressor blown out batteries 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.140
 cut the wires to the batteries 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.940
 feeding 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.320
 enough of such a large section 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.770
 2 wires by 75 approximately here 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.320
 red respectively + black minus 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.290
 so I decided to take them out through the cover 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.160
 just like that in a dumb up and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:54.220
 drilled a hole at the outlets glued 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.440
 mean separators 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.200
 rechargeable which were regular 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.360
 it means that the walls were not like 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.220
 rotated 180 degrees mean but u 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.300
 they have a straight plane means they 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.769
 stick well and fit for them 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.400
 well, about four screws with 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.720
 by half 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.090
 so on 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.690
 not to you what will you do in 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:26.130
 In general, all freed from batteries 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:26.130
 we put back the board observing the polarity 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:36.900
 plus or minus such automotive connectors 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:44.220
 is standard which is everywhere 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:46.660
 used in the car to power us 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.590
 so here is the cap here is this cap 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:56.430
 it means already traceable and respectively 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.430
 cable outlet cable outlet 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:06.300
 plus, respectively, red flavor 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.300
 black make sure to get there 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.220
 get into the nest channels 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:23.770
 so here nests sat on the seat cover 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:26.160
 it was closed in general, and that's all at home 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.160
 rezik 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.270
 two screws that wrap in 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.770
 Regular and here are these things such 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.720
 semicircular we stuck there 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.970
 in general, we have collected collected 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.280
 let's say this and here we can connect 8 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.389
 any source of 12 volts voltage from 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.530
 either car battery 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:57.520
 batteries either have new mean for 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:00.340
 computer power supply units battery 12 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.610
 Volt here we in general will be alive 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:10.590
 actually a battery like that 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.590
 way pump intex 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.699
 thanks if anyone is interested 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.699
 write in
