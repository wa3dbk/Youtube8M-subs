reason why anyone would plant Church is

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.100 
reason why anyone would plant Church is
to<00:03:22.060> reach<00:03:22.269> people<00:03:22.299> that<00:03:22.750> aren't<00:03:22.930> being

fun about these days is we're preaching

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.460 
fun about these days is we're preaching
an<00:03:47.500> old<00:03:47.680> message<00:03:48.100> in<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.340> new<00:03:48.489> way<00:03:49.140> we're<00:03:50.140> coming

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
an old message in a new way we're coming

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.390 
an old message in a new way we're coming
in<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:52.290> think<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.500> if<00:03:53.709> we<00:03:53.950> can<00:03:54.100> preach

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
in and I think that if we can preach

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.310 
in and I think that if we can preach
Jesus<00:03:54.850> with<00:03:55.030> passion<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.630> conviction<00:03:55.780> and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
Jesus with passion and conviction and

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.650 
Jesus with passion and conviction and
tell<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.549> someone<00:03:57.910> said<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.180> other<00:03:58.329> day<00:03:58.390> the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
tell you someone said the other day the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.220 
tell you someone said the other day the
the<00:03:59.310> gospel<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.370> not<00:04:00.489> tired<00:04:00.820> but<00:04:01.780> people<00:04:02.109> are

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
the gospel is not tired but people are

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.750 
the gospel is not tired but people are
tired<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.620> tired<00:04:02.829> presentations<00:04:03.549> of<00:04:03.670> the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
tired of tired presentations of the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.210 
tired of tired presentations of the
gospel<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.810> think<00:04:04.930> our<00:04:05.260> message<00:04:05.440> is<00:04:05.739> Jesus

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
gospel so I think our message is Jesus

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.509 
gospel so I think our message is Jesus
Jesus<00:04:06.459> Saves<00:04:07.329> jesus<00:04:07.810> heals<00:04:08.220> Jesus<00:04:09.220> is<00:04:09.400> the

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
Jesus Saves jesus heals Jesus is the

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.330 
Jesus Saves jesus heals Jesus is the
hope<00:04:09.670> for<00:04:09.910> humanity<00:04:10.500> Jesus<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.160> solution

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
hope for humanity Jesus is the solution

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.240 
hope for humanity Jesus is the solution
for<00:04:12.700> he's<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.180> antidote<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:14.170> if<00:04:14.739> we<00:04:14.950> can<00:04:15.130> give

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
for he's the antidote and if we can give
