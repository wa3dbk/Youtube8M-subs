00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
between it and then you can take the end

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.010 
between it and then you can take the end
of<00:04:50.270> your<00:04:50.330> comb<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.020> kind<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:52.690> separate<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:53.870> out

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.830 
know I just feel like it takes some of
that<00:05:34.699> bulk<00:05:35.060> off<00:05:35.870> of<00:05:36.639> my<00:05:37.639> head<00:05:37.940> now<00:05:38.539> if<00:05:38.720> you

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
that bulk off of my head now if you

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.260 
that bulk off of my head now if you
wanted<00:05:39.139> to<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:40.370> could<00:05:40.610> take<00:05:41.440> like<00:05:42.440> even<00:05:42.800> more

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270
