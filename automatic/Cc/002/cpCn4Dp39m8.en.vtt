00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello there have not been unpacking for a long time 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.389
 parcels and reviews and finally 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.759
 there was free time to do 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.849
 small such a reviewer on the vertical 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.500
 stand for sony playstation 3 super 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.240
 slim 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.970
 I ordered it in the online store tmart 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 it cost me twelve dollars 49 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.760
 cents at the moment such coasters 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.820
 there are already 12 in the online store 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.570
 dollars 93 cents grew up a bit 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.840
 the price is who is interested in a reference to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.510
 I 'll fold this stand in the comments 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.930
 to this video you can go to the store and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.100
 see who needs to buy 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 shipped on such here 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.860
 a cardboard box is not usual 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 the original podstavchka of course it 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:04.260
 chinese copy nothing on 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.479
 here we have no interesting box with 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.330
 back side we see a small 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.580
 vertical installation instructions 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.580
 stand 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.430
 well let's open a look and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.080
 install on sony playstation 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.259
 let's see how she will stand on 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.630
 vertical stand open 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.650
 there is a vertical stand 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.060
 so we have a strap 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:36.130
 to make it easier to remove the stand 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:41.850
 usually cardboard box 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.110
 packed here is such a package 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.850
 packed rather is in such 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.990
 the package is heavy on the sites on the form 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:59.340
 it was written I read what it has 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:02.819
 the size is like a normal disk then we compare 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.170
 is this really so 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:10.750
 by itself it is iron here here at 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.530
 we have plastic rubber inserts 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.599
 such 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.810
 on the other hand we have a bolt for 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.610
 mounts to sony playstation 3 and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.739
 rubber plugs 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.450
 such legs so that it does not slide 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.510
 about her, basically all the talk 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.610
 then there is nothing usually podstavchechka and hole 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.959
 for 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.120
 stuffs like that from sony playstation 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.220
 then I'll show you what this is for. 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.760
 hole 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.920
 because this will remove the side and now 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.920
 We will install on Sonic Station 3 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.480
 so here we have sony playstation 3 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.060
 super slim ka God forbid memory here 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.720
 probably finds food in my game yes 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 there is a game of bad reputation we can 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.739
 compare in size 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:11.650
 until the vertical stand is the same 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:13.120
 size as a normal disk that is 11 as 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:20.260
 disk 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:24.870
 player we put in place so here have 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:32.560
 us on this side is a stub 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:38.110
 we will need to remove it so probably 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:41.730
 I will use a needle because I do not 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.730
 then I'll pick it up 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:56.440
 Here is such a stub we take 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:04:00.069
 podsvetochka poorly visible of course through 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:06.329
 camera well, nothing can be done come on 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.329
 come on come on come on let's twist 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:21.040
 Well, in principle, and all in principle, and all 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:24.310
 I do not need to clamp tightly 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.940
 normal penny rather penny 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:33.850
 by five 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:38.140
 Russian rubles a little so tucked 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:42.180
 and here this here we insert a cap here 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:47.290
 this is a hole so that she is not lost 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:54.430
 something opened up close here and here 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:59.830
 it turns out this here before she somehow 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:04.030
 didn't stand very well 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.360
 but now it is normally on the stand 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.660
 anywhere now she will not get well on this 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.820
 Probably everyone thanks for watching 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.310
