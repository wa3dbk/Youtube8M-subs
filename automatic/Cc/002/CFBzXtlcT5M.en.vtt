00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.480
 marion limal has just laid 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.690
 his suitcases on the Finisterian point 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.880
 this 27-year-old left-back has a nice 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 course behind it yet a 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.150
 another discipline could have revealed it in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 done it's a little aware that in 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.120
 france one is bine detected actually a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.550
 admin and that's it we went to see my 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 father asking that you know me 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.610
 such as his daughter is playing in full and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.810
 from there in fact I was oriented 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.220
 this is said first soasta manager 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.619
 the France team now who at 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 the time was in office in savoie va 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.130
 direct to a club 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.509
 So here after bin it to me that the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.300
 let 's say that I was doing 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.259
 gymnastics I loved that a house 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.750
 do not understand about my 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.820
 template here it is and that was it at 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.410
 innovation and at that moment I am 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.390
 am saying well bah between the hand and the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.440
 gymnastic 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.420
 it was more luck in the belly 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.800
 but I can not accuse him anymore and more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.710
 chances to evolve initiated in 2004 the year 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.210
 from her bac she joins besançon 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.220
 juggling between studies and the hand 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.369
 it is in this club that she will discover 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.900
 the high level there at besançon so she 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 only to leave I was not 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.369
 inevitably obvious I am wearing my tray so 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.200
 I am doing a set of trainings 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.060
 I ended up with the b1 while 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 I did not necessarily imagine coming 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.680
 directly here with microphone I played 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.840
 there I have a job of young people from the center of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.579
 training that after real I evolved 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.619
 I continued my studies next to I 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:13.200
 went pro last year and after 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.760
 it chained quickly because my 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.680
 last year actually I was called 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.010
 in France team with the team of 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.500
 la France 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.760
 she won a medal in 2009 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.980
 of silver at the world championships in 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.799
 china a new stage then begins 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.020
 for marion who joins the ipo club in 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.750
 Austria 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.410
 I contacted this is a club in 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.120
 l1 and champions league 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.680
 in the last data but it was 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.230
 really a nice team with a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.700
 big family structure and halak who 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.290
 I was attracted to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.820
 ambitions at the highest level necessarily 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.530
 and when we say to a 22-year-old 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.930
 who has evolved somewhat in league 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.210
 champions inevitably it's interesting and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.720
 here I am in the sale 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.400
 their puget not hesitated I went there 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.510
 it was surprising to many 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.910
 of me I do not think what I do 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.010
 still 9 may but for me and I think 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.020
 that it was a first after two 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.850
 big seasons without holidays are 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.220
 still catches up and an injury to 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.810
 wrist delays it in its progression 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.490
 finally the wrist for a misfortune for 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.070
 something difficult because we 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.990
 never know how will come back 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.390
 opera and me it was super quality 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.810
 complicated to return these regions on 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.340
 all 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.130
 it is in these moments that we feel 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.060
 we are alone abroad anyway 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.800
 because precisely it is also in 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.480
 is in difficult times that 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.160
 we build ourselves challenge went 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.840
 return 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.980
 I did not know where and when it rained more 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.080
 of time that I would have liked 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.500
 no i always have i always want to 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.549
 beat me to get there 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.260
 that this is in the moments of 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.280
 injury have even after that is for there 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.480
 for everything I think we must not let go 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.049
 the sarthe like that I wanted a 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.019
 beating and have at no time I 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.480
 I'm saying here it's too much galley I 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.879
 can no longer rai uno 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.549
 in 2011 she returns to the east hex 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:05.489
 signed m unfortunately she does not 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:08.769
 will not succeed in imposing any 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:14.099
 coach had picture of me before my 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.099
 injury at my best 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.359
 this is ugly it's complicated for 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.130
 him because he was waiting he was waiting 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.620
 a lot of me and I did not 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.880
 necessarily because because 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.960
 I was coming back from injury that I knew 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.990
 that I still had a long way to go 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.449
 to do and so here are some moments 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.949
 where I did not know how to answer presents 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.690
 moments when I have not had my chance concludes 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:39.490
 so it was complicated but I think 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.740
 I managed to get out of this year 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.110
 difficult 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.520
 here is 3 unfortunately not necessarily 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.800
 stay at metz because I think it 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.620
 has been complicated yet to work 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.810
 Under these conditions there I think it 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.520
 also served me for the continuation she 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.250
 then leave Lorraine for nîmes 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.229
 a club that will revive both 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.340
 clichés that we can have it's true 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.810
 it is true that it is difficult to 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.270
 get into their flesh all that is 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.099
 by cons when it is returned 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.729
 a happiness what these voices I spent there 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.889
 two years 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.479
 great it was not always easy to 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.470
 high level handball because because 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.870
 when I arrived I was still in 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.940
 full doubt fast and I think I was 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:23.680
 a little broken I rebuilt myself 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:29.940
 really I knew how to regain confidence and 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:33.470
 brest season and its new destination 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.390
 here the time of new challenges 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.750
 I think for me it was a 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.650
 challenge really never asked for the 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.310
 it's an ambitious club that puts the 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.710
 ways to succeed there are some 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.620
 very interesting short-term projects 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.790
 and I wanted to be part of it 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.040
 I already knew girls who 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.950
 were playing what we already try laurent 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.940
 for having had contacts in writing 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.390
 I want to continue to progress 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:09.140
 with a new challenge for me there I 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:11.300
 think I'm not deceived marion has 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.480
 known the France team and it's a 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.980
 goal for her to find her back 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.360
 strongly shaken to find the team of 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.610
 la France 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.520
 that would be great after I do not 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.540
 not veil the criticism on the end 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.610
 we see young people and young people 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.660
 karim and that was my case when I 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.630
 arrived in France team it's 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.570
 does this is the logic appreciated the to 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.430
 in the short term we go back up the angry 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.900
 that now I can claim a 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.910
 class necessarily say after me I 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.070
 want to help especially the club of brest to 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.800
 back up we'll see 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.560
 I hope it will be soon we will take 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.580
 at this year's matches each one 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.580
 after others because it's going to be 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.560
 difficult we know very well but that's it 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.720
 there is way that it is a beautiful 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.780
 history and I hope to be part of 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.000
 contemporaries we know the career of 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.680
 handball is not eternal 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.540
 Mario would like to reconvert to 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.650
 guinea but she also has other dreams 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:14.780
 I think there are no hits 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:16.490
 and that's not it I do not do again 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.830
 extraordinary things but then I think 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.240
 that one day I will travel a lot 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.960
 maybe all I do not necessarily 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.610
 to make any doubt about any subject we 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.530
 see friends who brake their bag to 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.690
 back and his party to go to at 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.620
 end of the world here I would love said 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.000
 I love to discover 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.669
 that's why we're here too 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.509
 the big spaces 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:40.759
 see beautiful things and I think that 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:42.169
 really one day I see there I will leave 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:45.410
 everything separates when I do not know how 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:48.789
 but I hope to have the opportunity to 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.789
 quickly make a trailer
