00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
climbed out if I would not have had this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649 
climbed out if I would not have had this
I<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.609> been<00:01:11.729> deep<00:01:11.969> trouble<00:01:12.359> in<00:01:12.420> fact

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I would have been deep trouble in fact

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.760 
I would have been deep trouble in fact
there's<00:01:12.869> no<00:01:13.020> way<00:01:13.139> I<00:01:13.170> could<00:01:13.319> have<00:01:13.350> made<00:01:13.499> it<00:01:13.530> out

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
there's no way I could have made it out

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.429 
there's no way I could have made it out
so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> had<00:01:14.969> this<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.389> stuff<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.899> it<00:01:16.409> was

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so I had this kind of stuff and it was

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.789 
so I had this kind of stuff and it was
in<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.740> backpack<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.399> I<00:01:17.429> chose<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:19.560> some

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
in my backpack but I chose for some

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.309 
in my backpack but I chose for some
reason<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:21.060> laziness<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:21.749> probably<00:01:22.020> part<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
reason but laziness was probably part of

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.730 
reason but laziness was probably part of
it<00:01:22.459> I<00:01:23.459> chose<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.499> the<00:01:25.529> time

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it I chose not to use it at the time

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.889
