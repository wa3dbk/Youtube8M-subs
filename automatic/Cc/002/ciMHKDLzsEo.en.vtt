 The heather genus has numerous species of small shrubs with winter and spring flowering, to which are added the calluna and daboecia species 

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:28.094
 other heather plants with flowers very similar to those of heather and therefore assimilated to it. 

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:34.958
 Most heathers are small, robust, evergreen shrubs that do not fear the cold 

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:46.013
 they are therefore grown in the garden or on the terrace, both in the ground and in a vase 

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:53.022
 They prefer quite cool locations, so let's avoid placing them in excessively sheltered or hot places; 

00:00:53.971 --> 00:01:02.971
 they love sunlight, even direct, but they can develop without any problems even in semi-shaded or shaded places 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:12.549
 therefore in areas with mild winters we place them in a slightly shady place, while in areas with very cold winter temperatures we prefer sunny areas 

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:27.494
 These are acidophilic plants, therefore they fear the presence of calcium in the soil, and should be grown using specific soil for acidophilic plants, mixed with little sand and peat 

00:02:05.538 --> 00:02:12.540
 if we live in an area that has a lot of limestone in the water we remember to often replace the soil where we grow heathers 

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:18.110
 every year, in late summer, extract them from the soil and add another substrate for acidophilic plants 

00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:50.290
 For the same reason, at least once a year, we add watering fertilizer to the water used for watering 

00:02:51.471 --> 00:03:00.470
 The heathers are plants that come from humid and cool places, so throughout the year we try to keep the cultivation soil moist, but not soaked in water or with stagnation 

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:09.940
 let's intervene with the watering when the soil has already slightly dried, avoiding to exceed with the frequency and the amount of watering 

00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:21.280
 Every 15-20 days we add water to the watering fertilizer for flowering plants
