00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
trying to get critical focus with them

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.510 
trying to get critical focus with them
by<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.220> using<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> focus<00:00:30.119> ring<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:31.050> lens

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
by just using the focus ring on a lens

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.709 
by just using the focus ring on a lens
you're<00:00:32.520> probably<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.180> frustrated

pretty<00:00:34.170> quickly<00:00:34.410> yeah<00:00:34.649> yeah<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> thing<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
pretty quickly yeah yeah the thing that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.040 
pretty quickly yeah yeah the thing that
a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.760> people<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> realize<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.780> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
a lot of people to realize is that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
a lot of people to realize is that
modern<00:00:37.530> photography<00:00:37.920> lenses<00:00:38.730> are<00:00:38.969> designed

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
modern photography lenses are designed

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020 
modern photography lenses are designed
to<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:40.440> quickly<00:00:40.770> autofocus<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:41.850> shooting

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
to very quickly autofocus when shooting

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.660 
to very quickly autofocus when shooting
stills<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> focus<00:00:43.500> ring<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.070> only

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
stills so the focus ring you know only

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
stills so the focus ring you know only
is<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> quarter<00:00:45.539> turn<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> entire

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
is like a quarter turn for the entire

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.860 
is like a quarter turn for the entire
range<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.719> you're

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
range right you know and so as you're

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
range right you know and so as you're
going<00:00:48.899> through<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> takes<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
going through it you know it takes a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
going through it you know it takes a
long<00:00:50.610> time<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.910> find<00:00:51.270> focus<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> know<00:00:51.809> so

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
long time to find focus you know so

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
long time to find focus you know so
there<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.230> zooming<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:53.100> yeah<00:00:53.219> real<00:00:53.489> quick

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
there we're zooming but yeah real quick

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.430 
there we're zooming but yeah real quick
turn<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> lot<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> movement

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
turn there it's not a lot of movement

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
turn there it's not a lot of movement
right<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.879> gets<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.480> difficult

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
right and so that gets really difficult

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.139 
right and so that gets really difficult
you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.109> you're<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.350> oh<00:00:58.609> yeah<00:00:59.609> if<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> ever

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you know you're like oh yeah if you ever

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.400 
you know you're like oh yeah if you ever
listen<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:00.809> camera<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.289> you're

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
listen to your camera when you're

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680 
listen to your camera when you're
shooting<00:01:01.530> stills<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.399> mean<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.510> such

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
shooting stills it's I mean it's such

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.980 
shooting stills it's I mean it's such
minut<00:01:04.379> precise<00:01:05.250> adjustments<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
minut precise adjustments that when you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.450 
minut precise adjustments that when you
start<00:01:07.229> shooting<00:01:07.350> video<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.010> cameras

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
start shooting video with these cameras

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429 
start shooting video with these cameras
it's<00:01:08.939> very<00:01:09.210> difficult<00:01:09.780> when<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.260> using

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it's very difficult when you're using

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.800 
it's very difficult when you're using
your<00:01:10.530> hand<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> lens<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.000> you'll

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
your hand on the lens to get that you'll

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780 
your hand on the lens to get that you'll
find<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> lot<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.950> vibration<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
find it but it's a lot of vibration a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.820 
find it but it's a lot of vibration a
lot<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> movement<00:01:15.600> sometimes<00:01:15.960> even<00:01:16.229> sound<00:01:16.530> is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
lot of movement sometimes even sound is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.080 
lot of movement sometimes even sound is
you<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.100> sort<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> keep<00:01:17.430> cranking<00:01:17.670> past

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you just sort of keep cranking past

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.550 
you just sort of keep cranking past
absolutely<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> mean<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.439> other

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
absolutely I mean and then the other

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
absolutely I mean and then the other
thing<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.330> over

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
thing about that is that you know over

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
thing about that is that you know over
time<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> find<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.220> very

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
time you're going to find it very

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600 
time you're going to find it very
difficult<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.270> repeatable<00:01:25.310> focus<00:01:26.310> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
difficult to get repeatable focus you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.740 
difficult to get repeatable focus you
know<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.850> you're<00:01:27.060> having<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.450> shooting<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
know if you're having you're shooting a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.060 
know if you're having you're shooting a
narrative<00:01:28.020> piece<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> somebody's<00:01:28.829> walking

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
narrative piece and somebody's walking

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
narrative piece and somebody's walking
into<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> room<00:01:29.670> yeah<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.630> very<00:01:30.780> difficult

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
into the room yeah it's very difficult

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
into the room yeah it's very difficult
to<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.560> by<00:01:31.680> hand<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.130> enter<00:01:32.790> into<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to do that by hand so enter into the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.539 
to do that by hand so enter into the
world<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.720> follow<00:01:34.200> focuses<00:01:34.770> yeah<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.280> very

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
world of follow focuses yeah a very

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
world of follow focuses yeah a very
traditional<00:01:35.820> tool<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> film<00:01:37.020> industry

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
traditional tool for the film industry

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
traditional tool for the film industry
absolutely<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> follow<00:01:38.790> focus<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.329> made<00:01:39.509> up

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
absolutely so a follow focus is made up

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
absolutely so a follow focus is made up
of<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> couple<00:01:40.020> parts<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.460> actual

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
of a couple parts here is an actual

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
of a couple parts here is an actual
follow<00:01:42.060> focus<00:01:42.240> unit<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.500> has<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
follow focus unit right so it has a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.060 
follow focus unit right so it has a
wheel<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.299> gear<00:01:45.540> box<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.860> on

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
wheel here in a gear box and on this on

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.289 
wheel here in a gear box and on this on
this<00:01:47.189> guy<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.790> attached<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
this guy right here I have attached it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.719 
this guy right here I have attached it

there's gears that are used in these

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.170 
there's gears that are used in these
gears<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.820> come<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.030> different

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
gears you know can come in different

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.240 
gears you know can come in different
sizes<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.079> formats<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.710> stuff<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.070> that

there's<00:01:56.579> magnetic<00:01:56.759> gears<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
there's magnetic gears that you just

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.539 
there's magnetic gears that you just
click<00:01:57.960> into<00:01:58.290> place<00:01:58.500> there's<00:01:58.950> ones<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.460> are

fitted<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> pressed<00:02:04.710> ring<00:02:05.009> absolutely

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
fitted with a pressed ring absolutely

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.639 
fitted with a pressed ring absolutely
and<00:02:05.670> all<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.180> gears<00:02:06.630> I'll<00:02:06.899> sort<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.320> mesh

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and all of these gears I'll sort of mesh

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.729 
and all of these gears I'll sort of mesh
with<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.039> gear<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> turn<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.810> takes<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
with this gear so as you turn it takes a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.550 
with this gear so as you turn it takes a
much<00:02:10.950> bigger<00:02:11.280> movement<00:02:11.879> over<00:02:12.599> here<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.290> turns

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
much bigger movement over here and turns

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.700 
much bigger movement over here and turns
it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.260 
it
the<00:02:13.830> small<00:02:14.190> movement<00:02:14.550> over<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:14.700> yeah<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.210> you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the small movement over here yeah so you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.730 
the small movement over here yeah so you
can<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.570> here<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.350> gear<00:02:16.590> is

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
can see here that this this gear is

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.050 
can see here that this this gear is
attached<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.520> gear<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.850> lens

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
attached of the gear on the lens

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180 
attached of the gear on the lens
interfaces<00:02:19.050> with<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.260> actual<00:02:19.500> false<00:02:19.770> focus

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
interfaces with the actual false focus

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.530 
interfaces with the actual false focus
they<00:02:20.310> kind<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.610> teeth<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.120> mesh<00:02:21.330> together

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
they kind of teeth that mesh together

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.690 
they kind of teeth that mesh together
and<00:02:21.960> move<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.500> now<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> find<00:02:23.310> with<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> follow

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and move it now I find with a follow

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.670 
and move it now I find with a follow
focus<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.720> other<00:02:24.870> thing<00:02:25.080> about<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.590> know

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
focus the other thing about it you know

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.170 
focus the other thing about it you know
with<00:02:25.860> using<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> traditional<00:02:26.310> focus<00:02:26.820> ring<00:02:27.150> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
with using the traditional focus ring is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.730 
with using the traditional focus ring is
that<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.480> feel<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.050> not<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.410> good<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.620> know

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
that the feel is not so good you know

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.320 
that the feel is not so good you know
sometimes<00:02:29.220> they're<00:02:29.430> too<00:02:29.550> tight<00:02:29.790> sometimes

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
sometimes they're too tight sometimes

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.420 
sometimes they're too tight sometimes
they're<00:02:30.840> too<00:02:30.960> loose<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.740> when<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.400> a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
they're too loose and when you get to a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
they're too loose and when you get to a
follow<00:02:32.700> focus<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> nice<00:02:33.690> smooth

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
follow focus you get a nice smooth

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.680 
follow focus you get a nice smooth
repeatable<00:02:35.370> motion<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.820> yeah<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.330> rack

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
repeatable motion on it yeah so rack

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.330 
repeatable motion on it yeah so rack
that<00:02:36.720> focus<00:02:37.320> there<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.800> you'll<00:02:37.920> sort<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.160> see

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
that focus there and you'll sort of see

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.400 
that focus there and you'll sort of see
in<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.520> monitor<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:39.240> as<00:02:39.360> he<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:40.080> through

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
in the monitor here as he can go through

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.950 
in the monitor here as he can go through
how<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:40.770> really<00:02:40.980> easy<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.640> find<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.210> so<00:02:42.420> he

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
how it's really easy to find that so he

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.690 
how it's really easy to find that so he
was<00:02:43.080> dealing<00:02:43.260> with<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.530> moving<00:02:43.950> subject<00:02:44.250> trying

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
was dealing with a moving subject trying

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.430 
was dealing with a moving subject trying
to<00:02:44.760> hit<00:02:44.880> their<00:02:45.030> mark<00:02:45.300> it'd<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:45.900> pretty<00:02:46.170> simple

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
to hit their mark it'd be pretty simple

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.740 
to hit their mark it'd be pretty simple
basically<00:02:47.040> what<00:02:47.370> would<00:02:47.460> happen<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.420> he

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
basically what would happen is that he

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.660 
basically what would happen is that he
would<00:02:48.870> set<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> focus<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.800> one<00:02:49.980> position<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
would set the focus in one position and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.880 
would set the focus in one position and
then<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.270> take<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> dry<00:02:52.170> erase<00:02:52.320> marker

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
then you take like a dry erase marker

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
then you take like a dry erase marker
and<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.550> put<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:53.910> mark<00:02:54.240> right<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.660> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
and just put a little mark right on the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.020 
and just put a little mark right on the
ring<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.800> know<00:02:55.920> near<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> mark<00:02:56.610> right<00:02:56.850> there

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
ring you know near the mark right there

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.850 
ring you know near the mark right there
and<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.810> would<00:02:57.960> move<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.290> focus<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and then you would move the focus to the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.630 
and then you would move the focus to the
next<00:02:59.130> position

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
next position

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.610 
next position
and<00:02:59.820> you'd<00:03:00.060> add<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> second<00:03:00.750> mark<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.200> what

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and you'd add a second mark and what

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.140 
and you'd add a second mark and what
would<00:03:01.740> just<00:03:01.890> happen<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.430> as<00:03:02.580> your<00:03:02.700> talent

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
would just happen is as your talent

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.850 
would just happen is as your talent
moved<00:03:03.420> through<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.780> scene<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.650> would<00:03:04.710> just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
moved through the scene you would just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.590 
moved through the scene you would just
be<00:03:04.980> watching<00:03:05.220> them<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.700> turning<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.270> hitting

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
be watching them and turning and hitting

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.930 
be watching them and turning and hitting
those<00:03:06.750> marks<00:03:07.140> as<00:03:07.260> they<00:03:07.800> step<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.460> each<00:03:08.640> major

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
those marks as they step to each major

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.400 
those marks as they step to each major
mark<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> set<00:03:09.840> yeah<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.290> there's

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
mark on the set yeah and there's

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.930 
mark on the set yeah and there's
different<00:03:10.590> implementations<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.760> you

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
different implementations of this you

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.760 
different implementations of this you
know<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.150> these<00:03:12.300> rings<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:13.260> know<00:03:13.350> obviously

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
know of these rings you know obviously

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.890 
know of these rings you know obviously
if<00:03:13.980> you're<00:03:14.010> running<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.490> camera<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.570> can<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.870> a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
if you're running the camera it can be a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.330 
if you're running the camera it can be a
little<00:03:16.020> difficult<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.620> see<00:03:16.860> over<00:03:16.950> there<00:03:17.190> right

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
little difficult to see over there right

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100 
little difficult to see over there right
so<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.180> know<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.750> motion<00:03:18.990> picture

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
so you know in the motion picture

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.860 
so you know in the motion picture
industry<00:03:19.290> there's<00:03:20.190> people's<00:03:20.610> job<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.630> all

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
industry there's people's job that's all

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.450 
industry there's people's job that's all
they<00:03:22.050> do<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.800> they're<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> focus<00:03:23.280> puller

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
they do is that they're a focus puller

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.220 
they do is that they're a focus puller
and<00:03:23.640> if<00:03:23.880> they<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.270> badly<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:24.840> don't<00:03:25.050> have

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and if they do it badly they don't have

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.260 
and if they do it badly they don't have
a<00:03:25.260> job<00:03:25.500> yeah<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.520> most<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.880> most<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.180> these

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
a job yeah and so most of most of these

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.790 
a job yeah and so most of most of these
follow<00:03:27.510> focuses<00:03:28.020> that<00:03:28.050> are<00:03:28.260> available<00:03:28.710> and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
follow focuses that are available and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.740 
follow focuses that are available and
will<00:03:28.890> work<00:03:29.010> with<00:03:29.040> DSLR<00:03:29.520> cameras<00:03:29.910> also<00:03:30.360> have

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
will work with DSLR cameras also have

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.050 
will work with DSLR cameras also have
support<00:03:31.200> for<00:03:31.520> industry<00:03:32.520> standard<00:03:32.820> whips

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
support for industry standard whips

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.340 
support for industry standard whips
right<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.840> actually<00:03:33.960> just<00:03:34.170> put<00:03:34.320> a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
right so you can actually just put a

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.840 
right so you can actually just put a
little<00:03:34.560> whip<00:03:34.710> into<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.070> follow<00:03:35.280> focus<00:03:35.490> and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
little whip into the follow focus and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.120 
little whip into the follow focus and
then<00:03:36.180> somebody<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.810> couple<00:03:37.380> feet<00:03:37.650> away<00:03:37.740> or<00:03:37.860> you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
then somebody a couple feet away or you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.440 
then somebody a couple feet away or you
know<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.250> little<00:03:38.580> knot<00:03:38.820> right<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.060> top<00:03:39.330> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
know a little knot right on top the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.510 
know a little knot right on top the
camera<00:03:39.720> operator<00:03:40.050> can<00:03:40.560> pull<00:03:40.740> focus<00:03:40.950> back<00:03:41.310> and

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
camera operator can pull focus back and

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.760 
camera operator can pull focus back and
forth<00:03:41.730> now<00:03:42.240> I<00:03:42.270> will<00:03:42.660> say<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.410> know<00:03:43.500> with

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
forth now I will say that you know with

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.260 
forth now I will say that you know with
a<00:03:43.800> follow<00:03:44.040> focus<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.490> can<00:03:44.610> get<00:03:44.760> repeatable

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
a follow focus you can get repeatable

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.330 
a follow focus you can get repeatable
nice<00:03:45.480> smooth<00:03:45.780> focusing<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.040> comes<00:03:47.220> back

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
nice smooth focusing but this comes back

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.830 
nice smooth focusing but this comes back
to<00:03:47.550> monitoring<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.060> little<00:03:48.270> bit<00:03:48.360> too<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.690> know

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
to monitoring a little bit too you know

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.360 
to monitoring a little bit too you know
you<00:03:49.170> always<00:03:49.410> want<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> be<00:03:49.740> make<00:03:49.920> sure<00:03:50.130> that

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
you always want to be make sure that

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.520 
you always want to be make sure that
you're<00:03:50.520> monitoring<00:03:51.030> properly<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:51.900> just

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you're monitoring properly and so just

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.230 
you're monitoring properly and so just
using<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.860> LCD<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.730> back<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.090> camera

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
using the LCD on the back of the camera

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.210 
using the LCD on the back of the camera
even<00:03:54.870> if<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.140> have<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.320> follow<00:03:55.590> focus<00:03:55.800> you're

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
even if you have a follow focus you're

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.590 
even if you have a follow focus you're
still<00:03:56.490> going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.700> find<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.210> know<00:03:57.240> hard<00:03:57.540> to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
still going to find it you know hard to

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.670 
still going to find it you know hard to
get<00:03:57.720> focused<00:03:58.050> right<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.380> can't<00:03:58.560> even

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
get focused right and you can't even

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.840 
get focused right and you can't even
really<00:03:58.830> use<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.160> viewfinder<00:03:59.370> because<00:03:59.790> if

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
really use the viewfinder because if

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.010 
really use the viewfinder because if
you're<00:03:59.970> looking<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.450> viewfinder<00:04:00.660> you

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
you're looking to the viewfinder you

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.930 
you're looking to the viewfinder you
can't<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.830> marks<00:04:02.220> all<00:04:02.490> right<00:04:02.760> follow

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
can't see the marks all right follow

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.650 
can't see the marks all right follow
focus<00:04:03.150> now

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
focus now

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.090 
focus now
ergonomically<00:04:04.350> if<00:04:04.530> you're<00:04:04.680> running<00:04:04.860> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
ergonomically if you're running and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.470 
ergonomically if you're running and
gunning<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.580> having<00:04:05.850> your<00:04:05.970> hand<00:04:06.180> out<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
gunning just having your hand out to the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.750 
gunning just having your hand out to the
side<00:04:06.570> gives<00:04:07.020> you<00:04:07.110> finer<00:04:07.530> control<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.490> you<00:04:08.550> can

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
side gives you finer control so you can

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.850 
side gives you finer control so you can
use<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.030> as<00:04:09.330> just<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.630> bigger<00:04:09.870> focus<00:04:10.200> knob<00:04:10.560> yep

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
use it as just a bigger focus knob yep

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.710 
use it as just a bigger focus knob yep
but<00:04:11.070> if<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.220> truly<00:04:11.520> are<00:04:11.850> using<00:04:12.270> marks<00:04:12.570> and

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
but if you truly are using marks and

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
but if you truly are using marks and
pulling<00:04:12.960> focus<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.800> absolutely<00:04:14.460> need<00:04:14.760> to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
pulling focus you absolutely need to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.760 
pulling focus you absolutely need to
mount<00:04:15.150> an<00:04:15.480> external<00:04:15.900> monitor<00:04:16.049> either<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.650> the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
mount an external monitor either to the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.820 
mount an external monitor either to the
camera<00:04:17.190> or<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.850> cage<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.780> both<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.350> camera

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
camera or to the cage so both the camera

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.099 
camera or to the cage so both the camera
operator<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.940> focus<00:04:21.299> puller<00:04:21.480> can<00:04:21.810> see<00:04:22.020> it

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
operator and the focus puller can see it

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.680 
operator and the focus puller can see it
if<00:04:22.680> that's<00:04:22.800> one<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.280> same<00:04:23.520> that's<00:04:23.820> okay<00:04:24.210> you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
if that's one the same that's okay you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.450 
if that's one the same that's okay you
could<00:04:24.810> have<00:04:24.900> your<00:04:25.020> camera<00:04:25.440> on<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.620> dolly<00:04:26.160> and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
could have your camera on a dolly and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.260 
could have your camera on a dolly and
you<00:04:26.580> can<00:04:26.700> be<00:04:26.760> walking

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
you can be walking

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.490 
you can be walking
with<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.509> camera<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.169> you're<00:04:28.259> going<00:04:28.379> to<00:04:28.440> be

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
with the camera but you're going to be

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.170 
with the camera but you're going to be
looking<00:04:28.889> in<00:04:29.009> the<00:04:29.099> viewfinder<00:04:29.129> and<00:04:29.759> pulling

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
looking in the viewfinder and pulling

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.089 
looking in the viewfinder and pulling
focus<00:04:30.539> at<00:04:30.629> the<00:04:30.690> same<00:04:30.900> time<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.740> know<00:04:31.800> gets

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
focus at the same time you know gets

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.939

practicing<00:04:56.460> with<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.849> understanding<00:04:57.360> how

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
practicing with it and understanding how

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.760

it<00:04:57.629> works<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.050> back<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.379> forth<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:58.680> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
it works in the back and forth and the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.200 
it works in the back and forth and the
play<00:04:58.919> that's<00:04:59.099> involved<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.580> think<00:05:00.090> what's

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
play that's involved I think what's

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.580 
play that's involved I think what's
important<00:05:00.599> that<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.750> point<00:05:00.960> out<00:05:01.139> here<00:05:01.440> is<00:05:01.560> that

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
important that a point out here is that

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.950 
important that a point out here is that
a<00:05:01.949> follow<00:05:02.220> focus<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.849> not<00:05:03.270> going<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.780> be<00:05:03.840> the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
a follow focus is not going to be the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.749 
a follow focus is not going to be the
first<00:05:04.169> piece<00:05:04.409> of<00:05:04.590> gear<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:05.250> run<00:05:05.460> out<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:05.610> buy

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.339 
first piece of gear you run out and buy
I<00:05:06.000> wouldn't<00:05:06.300> say<00:05:06.419> it's<00:05:06.599> one<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.229> most

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
I wouldn't say it's one of the most

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.800 
I wouldn't say it's one of the most
essential<00:05:07.710> pieces<00:05:08.069> no<00:05:08.460> but<00:05:08.729> it's<00:05:09.539> when<00:05:09.690> you

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
essential pieces no but it's when you

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.059
