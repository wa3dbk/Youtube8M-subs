00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
building no honestly though these are

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.299 
building no honestly though these are
the<00:00:06.540> old<00:00:06.750> world<00:00:07.020> trade<00:00:07.230> centers<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:07.950> in

great<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> thought<00:00:13.500> they<00:00:13.710> were<00:00:13.769> good

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
great you know I thought they were good

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.410 
great you know I thought they were good
at<00:00:14.099> first<00:00:14.309> because<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.969> know<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
at first because you know you have a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.599 
at first because you know you have a
height<00:00:15.660> limit<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.230> only<00:00:16.350> build<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.400> much

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
height limit you can only build so much

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.390 
height limit you can only build so much
you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.029> only<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.449> much<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:19.160> power<00:00:20.160> station

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
you can only do so much a power station

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.130 
you can only do so much a power station
over<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:21.240> using<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.570> mod<00:00:21.750> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
over there I'm using a mod that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.410 
over there I'm using a mod that
increases<00:00:22.650> view<00:00:22.859> distance<00:00:23.070> by<00:00:23.369> 200%<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.330> I'm

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
increases view distance by 200% so I'm

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.929 
increases view distance by 200% so I'm
able<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.689> see<00:00:24.900> pretty<00:00:25.560> far<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.189> which

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
able to see pretty far out there which

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.490 
able to see pretty far out there which
is<00:00:27.150> amazing<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> would<00:00:27.660> recommend<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.320> you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
is amazing I would recommend that if you

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.800 
is amazing I would recommend that if you
if<00:00:28.800> you're<00:00:28.949> planning<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.220> any<00:00:29.429> server<00:00:29.820> map<00:00:30.090> so

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
if you're planning on any server map so

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930 
if you're planning on any server map so
that<00:00:31.080> city<00:00:31.380> map<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.460> anyways<00:00:32.700> these<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that city map so anyways these are the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.720 
that city map so anyways these are the
towers<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.410> they<00:00:34.410> only<00:00:34.440> had<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:34.739> area<00:00:35.579> where

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
towers here they only had one area where

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.110 
towers here they only had one area where
you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.940> enter<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:37.850> wasn't<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.910> great

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you can enter you know wasn't that great

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.380 
you can enter you know wasn't that great
so<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:40.200> decided<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> first

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
so I decided you know what the first

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.819 
so I decided you know what the first
tallest<00:00:42.390> building<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> make<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
this game are these guys so I made this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.709

these<00:00:48.690> two<00:00:49.140> buildings<00:00:50.090> 200<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.360> these

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
these two buildings 200 if these

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.979 
these two buildings 200 if these
soundwall<00:00:52.500> three<00:00:52.860> blocks<00:00:53.160> high

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
soundwall three blocks high

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.880 
soundwall three blocks high
unfortunately<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> didn't<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> spire<00:00:55.680> at

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
