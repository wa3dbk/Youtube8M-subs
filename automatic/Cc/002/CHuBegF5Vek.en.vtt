00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
first video that dirty words didn't
speak<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:23.189> new<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.369> YouTube<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:25.160> either<00:00:26.160> I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
speak I was new to YouTube so either I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820 
speak I was new to YouTube so either I
was<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.939> bit<00:00:27.060> shy<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> guess<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:27.869> subsequently

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
was a bit shy I guess but subsequently

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.220 
was a bit shy I guess but subsequently
this<00:00:29.699> knife<00:00:29.910> has<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.449> stood<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.019> my

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this knife has really stood out my

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.350 
this knife has really stood out my
collections<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> great<00:00:32.520> knife<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.329> I

tyre a string so it's easier to fish out
your<00:04:32.039> pocket<00:04:32.390> but<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.110> think<00:04:34.320> that's

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
your pocket but so I think that's

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.480 
your pocket but so I think that's

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
exactly the same blade in there just

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.779

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
being only one feature and then just

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.959 
being only one feature and then just
compare<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.590> against<00:04:47.039> a<00:04:47.280> couple<00:04:47.760> other

Spyderco which is a Danish League when I

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.290 
Spyderco which is a Danish League when I
was<00:05:30.659> a<00:05:30.750> slightly<00:05:31.080> shorter<00:05:31.349> blade<00:05:32.010> length<00:05:32.300> one

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
was a slightly shorter blade length one

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.040 
was a slightly shorter blade length one
handed<00:05:33.659> opening<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:35.130> Pingo<00:05:38.990> so<00:05:39.990> she

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
handed opening this is the Pingo so she

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.159 
handed opening this is the Pingo so she
probably<00:05:40.289> got<00:05:40.530> less<00:05:40.710> blade<00:05:41.010> to<00:05:41.820> it<00:05:41.940> but<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:43.080> be

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
probably got less blade to it but to be

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.550

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.879 
steel type if that's your thing if
you're<00:05:48.659> going<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.870> want<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.110> resharpen<00:05:49.530> it

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
you're going to want to resharpen it

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.279 
you're going to want to resharpen it
again<00:05:50.130> and<00:05:50.280> again<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.870> that's<00:05:52.050> something

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
to consider but a different price range

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.279 
to consider but a different price range
at<00:05:54.030> least<00:05:54.419> doubled<00:05:54.870> price<00:05:55.520> so<00:05:56.520> all<00:05:56.930> as<00:05:57.930> I
