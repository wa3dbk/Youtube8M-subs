00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.070
 Yes 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.600
 to 6 you know it so imagine it 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.910
 each one just a little bit higher 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.040
 But it really works that the professionals 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.830
 to years factory are back weeks long 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.870
 to think about the music 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.160
 what effect and that's all 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.080
 Above all, works for the one would be too 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.000
 special seems it needs it 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.800
 really very, very different from what you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 New Year's Eve is used to it because it is too 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.440
 not only senseless bum but 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 really attuned to every smallest 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.690
 music particle I think 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.220
 And definitely always something 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.650
 Every fire department was special 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 even has its own handwriting and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 the right time to see that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.050
 meanwhile I'm in the team for years 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.650
 and I look forward to many 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.240
 individual events many themselves 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.690
 here we have, for example, 100 mm 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 google bomb 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.210
 she has a collection effect franken 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.490
 they will be out of gfk tomorrow 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.030
 shot the extra boosted for this is 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 They have a distance of about 130 meters 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.040
 these effects and those become, so to speak 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 on a muted voice 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.040
 connected with each other 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.210
 with different at the time 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.280
 It's easy 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.330
 a system built in they call themselves 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.369
 At the foot in front sits an electrician's turn 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.050
 we then electrically perfect but 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.570
 We can do that in our show as we do 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.820
 programmed 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.560
 yes you are now fireworks 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 almost exclusively via radio technology 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 are ignited exclusively 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.560
 pre-programmed ignited because so much too 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.020
 thin not at all anymore 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.530
 will be controlled by hand alone 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.780
 have almost for the ten minutes today 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.150
 617 points the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.819
 the whole thing has to be controlled 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.740
 previously programmed over the laptop then 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.830
 inflation system read 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.770
 this is then supposed to be over the radio 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.959
 module with the transmitters in it 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.370
 the audience is hopefully the same 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.989
 as we are in safe distance from 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.180
 several hundred meters so that really 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.130
 It was not any amount 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.620
 to be met about the carnival 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.230
 can go if you have such a program 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.300
 Build up looks like you like the bottom 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.860
 wav file with which she actually runs 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.260
 everyone from a massive dispute or 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.480
 similar is shown in the graphic 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.800
 how to get the single five points 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.959
 here in this case his opinion 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.090
 rose slightly off the front goes 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.550
 how long the effect takes to get to 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.260
 ignite how long he is in the sky late and 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.030
 above for us much more important in the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.690
 actually programming the whole thing in 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.850
 textform that it is a bit faster with us 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.100
 So we have about 400 bullets bombed in 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.780
 our own fireworks of mine to 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.519
 there are still various battery fireworks 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:24.640
 and fireworks instead of with 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:28.600
 ground fireworks and should 2007 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.790
 were only 90 small settled before 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.620
 all in the east of germany clapper 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.610
 magdeburg and cottbus we want the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.140
 first dates to came up with later 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.530
 berlin / rostock page and now 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.810
 are there so let the 14 stations in 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.580
 summer always gives we are quite happy 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.170
 you always ready new locations 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.840
 take 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.360
 great for what it conditions the whether 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.280
 animal in heath park shoots directly in 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.560
 The screaming guy gives it in ash 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.020
 for opel between dredge shoot it 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.340
 every year is great again and the 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.599
 Fireworks let them go too 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.599
 again inspire the duty 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.240
 Great
