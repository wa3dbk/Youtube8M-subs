page and what I recommend doing is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.609

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.709 
because of the thick black lines on this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
from and then cutting it out from there

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.660 
from and then cutting it out from there
with<00:01:43.380> an<00:01:43.500> exacto<00:01:43.920> knife<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> use

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
with an exacto knife or you can use

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
with an exacto knife or you can use
scissors<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.880> makes<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:49.229> don't

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
basically this is a something that looks

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.779 
basically this is a something that looks
like<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> buttons<00:01:55.469> up<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> front<00:01:56.039> so<00:01:56.520> all

like it buttons up the front so all

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.029 
like it buttons up the front so all
you're<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.359> is<00:01:57.749> this<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.859> back

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
you're going to do is this is the back

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.950 
you're going to do is this is the back
you're<00:01:59.999> just<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> fold<00:02:00.539> over<00:02:00.719> these

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
you're just going to fold over these

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.590

sides

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
sides

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:12.930 
sides
and<00:02:02.720> then<00:02:05.980> this<00:02:06.980> over<00:02:07.990> hangs<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.240> just

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and then this over hangs so you just

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.650 
and then this over hangs so you just
fold<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:17.270> this<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:20.090> do<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.330> correctly

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
fold it like this I can do it correctly

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.700 
fold it like this I can do it correctly
and<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.630> glue<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.840> into<00:02:24.020> place<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.560> I'll

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
and you just glue it into place so I'll

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.020 
and you just glue it into place so I'll
glue<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.070> into<00:02:25.310> place<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.700> show<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.850> what

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
glue that into place and show you what

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.020

that looks like

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.640 
that looks like
so<00:02:29.030> then<00:02:29.180> glued<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.720> looks<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.350> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
so then glued it looks like this and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:39.900 
so then glued it looks like this and
