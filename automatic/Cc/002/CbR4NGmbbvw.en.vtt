include an HDMI cable it's nice ah so
we're<00:02:21.489> getting<00:02:21.609> to<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.090> monitor

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
we're getting to the monitor

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.020 
we're getting to the monitor
this<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:25.320> extremely<00:02:27.209> thin<00:02:28.209> as<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:29.109> can<00:02:29.470> see

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this is extremely thin as you can see

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.300 
this is extremely thin as you can see
like<00:02:31.030> here's<00:02:31.630> my<00:02:31.780> finger<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:33.070> small

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
like here's my finger and I have small

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.580 
like here's my finger and I have small
hands

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
hands

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.289 
hands
so<00:02:35.590> um<00:02:36.400> something<00:02:37.329> to<00:02:37.450> compare<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.200> length<00:02:38.380> to

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.620 

it's<00:02:43.299> thinner<00:02:44.609> maybe<00:02:45.609> about<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.239> same<00:02:46.420> size

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
it's thinner maybe about the same size

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.759 
it's thinner maybe about the same size
as<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.590> Xbox<00:02:48.280> case<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:50.019> that's<00:02:50.079> how<00:02:50.260> thin<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.590> is

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
as a Xbox case so that's how thin it is

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.250 
as a Xbox case so that's how thin it is
obviously<00:02:51.549> it's<00:02:52.180> HDMI<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:54.030> LED<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.630> LEDs<00:02:56.049> are

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
obviously it's HDMI and LED so LEDs are

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.520 
obviously it's HDMI and LED so LEDs are
usually<00:02:56.680> thinner<00:02:57.720> down<00:02:58.720> here<00:02:59.079> at<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> bottom

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
usually thinner down here at the bottom

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.890 
usually thinner down here at the bottom
let<00:03:00.489> me<00:03:00.519> fix<00:03:00.910> my<00:03:04.290> see<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:06.489> right<00:03:06.730> here<00:03:06.900> in

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
let me fix my see that but right here in

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.160 
let me fix my see that but right here in
here<00:03:08.799> or<00:03:09.010> HDMI<00:03:09.670> then<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.209> have<00:03:10.389> a<00:03:10.420> VGA<00:03:10.660> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
here or HDMI then you have a VGA and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.370 
here or HDMI then you have a VGA and
your<00:03:11.560> power<00:03:11.769> right<00:03:12.040> here

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
your power right here

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.460 
your power right here
so<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.579> basic<00:03:16.120> per

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
oh yeah the ISA will go over here yeah

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.380 
oh yeah the ISA will go over here yeah
