00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello guys and welcome back on call 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.029
 laugh manager in this video veil 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.710
 show you a recipe for how to create 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.809
 in the house some excellent mini muffins with 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.389
 almond flour then completely 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 gluten-free chocolate and pumpkin 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.170
 cinnamon including the recipe from one 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.970
 American bloggers had very born died 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.380
 Conversions with various problems 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 mc systems 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.630
 but this our first attempt then 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.170
 first ingredient a tablespoon of seeds 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.119
 of course very rich in linen 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.079
 fiber omega3 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.730
 then about a tablespoon of water per 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.050
 create this mix a spoon 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.600
 of water 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.510
 then we got a new egg 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.050
 whole is used to create also 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.649
 this a moment the amalgam where to put 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.110
 then all the ingredients then gods 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.309
 spoons of pumpkin pulp in america 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.649
 for example they can buy it 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.109
 directly from some cans come 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.239
 in the supermarkets also spiced sum 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.720
 we took a normal pumpkin 1 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.720
 squash we took two spoons 3 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 spoons of the pulp then one 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.009
 banana still wasn't very ripe 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 however we are working to give in short a 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.720
 moment of flavors and consistency always 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 to the dough because we remember that in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.590
 this case we have the flour of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.570
 almonds as a base rather than 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.450
 it will appear normal so we need 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.880
 of this banana pumpkin too 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 precisely to create the right the right 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 consistency 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.189
 here is our banana 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.799
 and then we used it 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.590
 two tablespoons of me then thought of 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.770
 maple syrup also like this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.130
 sweetener to use stevia 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.360
 liquid or agave juice and also here in 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.390
 will 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.700
 then this and almond milk also here 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:06.210
 two tablespoons of almond milk 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 and then a vanilla extract 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.000
 also here about a spoon always in 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.250
 this hand but here is the flour of 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.240
 almonds 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.860
 we also put about 2 tablespoons here 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.900
 this is quite big there is also in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.120
 I trade that a little bit more pina 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.150
 we found this decided to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.400
 do this then re sodium carbonate 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.490
 therefore as a leavening agent 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.740
 half a spoon as you see 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.000
 here is also cinnamon 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.620
 here it goes at will 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.530
 there are those who like what's there who don't 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.600
 like it is our case in short there 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.990
 sorry is that we have put half 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.950
 then just a little cinnamon spoon 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.310
 of salt 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.510
 however let's say it helps 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.180
 and then we know the second ones 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.710
 actually rather than putting 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.750
 all in this this bowl in this 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.820
 terrina sense to put it all 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.680
 directly into the blender is obviously 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.600
 our first time the first one 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.090
 attempt has put it all into the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.040
 blender I really get blended more 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.900
 simple in this way also blend 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.600
 fruit like banana that otherwise 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.720
 by hand it would not be so comfortable this is 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.209
 the final compound and then on another 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.410
 Italian we have precisely had no 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.120
 we have chocolate chips well 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.820
 cut this dark chocolate and 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.160
 then always put in the amalgam 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.720
 because it goes to create the dough anyway 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.360
 final is our mini muffins then with 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.560
 extra virgin olive oil we have 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:46.320
 the molds are slightly wet 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.090
 silicone to avoid precisely that 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.130
 the dough sticks once and 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.050
 microwave once at the forum for in 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.870
 we have this brush 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.110
 brushed the oil on the surface 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.720
 then here's something we noticed with 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.520
 this attempt is that in filling then 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.380
 we filled the molds and maybe 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.430
 too much because we have it anyway 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.519
 used the measures used 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.910
 from this recipe is therefore the molds 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.700
 then they are obviously once baked and 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.100
 then rise a moment of the mixture 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.600
 it came out then they have some of these 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.889
 we also added some bows 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.069
 of almonds 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.629
 then to create a variant here 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.819
 as you saw about two minutes e 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.669
 microwave half a minute at a time 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.379
 600 watts and for this final product 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.120
 this was the first attempt then 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.210
 maybe they are not beautiful to see but 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.729
 we commit ourselves just next time 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.979
 which we will continue to do better precisely 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.870
 and even more presentable in this is 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.279
 let us know what you think about it 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.279
 hello soon guys
