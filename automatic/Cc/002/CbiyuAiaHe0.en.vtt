00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
for the first episode I think it was

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.470 
for the first episode I think it was
very<00:02:54.740> good<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.430> illustrating<00:02:56.000> about<00:02:56.180> how<00:02:56.450> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
very good and illustrating about how a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.960 
very good and illustrating about how a
little<00:02:56.810> lie<00:02:57.110> can<00:02:57.410> grow<00:02:57.620> into<00:02:58.010> something<00:02:58.340> big

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
little lie can grow into something big

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.860 
little lie can grow into something big
that<00:02:59.600> shows<00:02:59.959> out<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.920> end<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.459> also<00:03:02.360> really

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
that shows out in the end I also really

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.230
