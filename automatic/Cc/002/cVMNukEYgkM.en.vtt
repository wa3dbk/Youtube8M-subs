00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
came with a pop filter so first you take

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
came with a pop filter so first you take
your<00:01:08.400> tripod<00:01:08.610> which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.720> thing<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.170> don't

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
your tripod which is this thing I don't

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.170 
your tripod which is this thing I don't
think<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.430> part<00:01:11.670> sticking<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
think it has this part sticking out of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.000 
think it has this part sticking out of
it<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> I've<00:01:12.780> had<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.619> try<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it is that I've had this and try to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
it is that I've had this and try to
unscrew<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.909> part<00:01:15.180> stayed<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.720> there

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
unscrew it and this part stayed in there

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
unscrew it and this part stayed in there
so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.380> guess<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.340> its<00:01:17.640> gonna<00:01:17.790> look

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
so I guess that's what its gonna look

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.190 
so I guess that's what its gonna look
like<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.960> basically<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.659> hot<00:01:22.020> why

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
