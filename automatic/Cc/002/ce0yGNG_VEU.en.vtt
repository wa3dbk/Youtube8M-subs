[GIGGLING]

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.987
ELMO: Well, Elmo likes
Whoopi's arm.

00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:09.300
WHOOPI: Oh, thank you, Elmo.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.520
ELMO: Elmo also like the stuff
that covers Whoopi's arm.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.080
WHOOPI: Oh, my skin.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.340
ELMO: Yeah, yeah,
Whoopi's skin.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.144
Yeah, it's soft and
pretty, too.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:23.080
Elmo thinks Whoopi's skin
is a very pretty brown.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.320
WHOOPI: Oh, well thank
you, Elmo.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.500
Hey, you know what?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.520
ELMO: Huh?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.520
WHOOPI: I like your fur, too.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.560
ELMO: Really?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.080
WHOOPI: Yeah.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.600
It's a great color, red.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.750
And it's nice and bright
and soft, too.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.590
It's nice and furry.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.324
ELMO: Yeah, Elmo's fur
is furry, all right.

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:48.750
But it's not like Whoopi's
skin, mm-mm.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.590
WHOOPI: Well, that's
only because fur

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.494
and skin are different.

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:53.390
ELMO: Wow.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.100
But Whoopi has lots of
fur on Whoopi's head.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.970
WHOOPI: Well, this--

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.880
ELMO: Look at that.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.760
WHOOPI: Yeah, this
isn't fur, Elmo.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.680
This is hair.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.410
Yeah, it's a little like
fur, but it's more

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.710
hairy, not so furry.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.210
ELMO: Really?

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.200
Well, can Elmo touch
Whoopi's hair?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.250
WHOOPI: Oh, of course.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.984
ELMO: Oh good.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:18.316
WHOOPI: Here you go.

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:23.594
ELMO: Oh, [LAUGH], boy,
that feels good.

00:01:23.594 --> 00:01:25.150
Elmo likes Whoopi's hair.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.410
WHOOPI: Thanks.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.660
ELMO: All those curlicues, they
get so nice and bouncy.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.590
WHOOPI: Yeah, they kind of do
bounce around, don't they?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.450
ELMO: Yeah.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.880
Boy, Elmo can't do that.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.135
Watch.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:39.710
See, did anything bounce?

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.000
WHOOPI: No.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.390
ELMO: See?

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.880
Elmo's fur doesn't bounce.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.250
WHOOPI: Oh, but that's OK,
because it looks great.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.633
ELMO: Oh?

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.330
WHOOPI: Yeah, all that
red fur all over your

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.610
body, it's so nice.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.890
[LAUGHING]

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.585
ELMO: Yeah, Whoopi like's
Elmo's fur.

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:54.500
WHOOPI: I do.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.820
ELMO: Yeah.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.790
And Elmo likes Whoopi's
skin and hair.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.860
WHOOPI: Well, thank you.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.460
[GASP]

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.530
ELMO: Let's trade!

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.390
WHOOPI: No, no.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.900
No, Elmo, we can't.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.750
It's not possible.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.180
ELMO: Why?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.820
WHOOPI: Well, because you can't
trade things like skin

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.340
and hair and fur.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.680
See?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.540
It doesn't come off.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.590
And the hair is on
for good, too.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.955
It's just like your fur.

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:19.230
ELMO: Ow.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.135
Yeah.

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:21.210
Elmo see that.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.000
WHOOPI: Yeah.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.170
But even if we could trade,
Elmo, I wouldn't want to.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.910
I like my skin, and I like
my hair, and I'd like

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.210
to keep them both.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.380
I mean, don't you
like your fur?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.605
ELMO: Well, yeah, Elmo
likes his fur.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.850
And Elmo wants to keep his
fur just where it is.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.670
WHOOPI: There you go.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.610
ELMO: On Elmo.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.400
WHOOPI: Yeah.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.310
ELMO: Right next to Whoopi.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.750
WHOOPI: Aww.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.540
I like that too, Elmo.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.790
ELMO: Yeah.
