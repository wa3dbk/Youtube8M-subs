00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello I look for more in the video and I 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.819
 I bring something informative that to me the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 I really think that something is quite good and 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.320
 it's about great cars and paradise 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.420
 many will wonder what is great 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.150
 car site stops based on everything 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
 that I have read it is a big point 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.500
 5 that opens the possibility to a new 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 expansion but it would not be in this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.510
 console would be about the new nets since 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.490
 as well you know is the xbox juan 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 and playstation 4 the truth that I 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.900
 it looks pretty good and everything breaks loose 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.240
 through a rumor of social the world 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
 along with rockstar then there are more 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.590
 little things that I do not want to tell you but me 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.260
 what I come here does not so much talk about what 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.700
 that happened so much in that meeting but neither 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 what would the rumor be like I want to tell you 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.620
 a little about this game for everything that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.140
 I read don try on a new city since 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.610
 that will be in san andreas but they will not be 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 the saints because as you well 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.890
 know the saints is the city and san 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.470
 Andreas is the one then here we have 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 the possibility of another new dlc as 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.660
 it would be 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.370
 grand theft auto 4 episodes from liberty 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.240
 city ​​that as you well know was 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.100
 as an expansion 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 so here I see the possibility of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.900
 what can he do in the saints but what 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.940
 what more fans ask and everything I saw 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.860
 here and as you well know from the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.080
 Syrian name stop and is referred to as if 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 the city ​​of paradise and now this we 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.070
 we refer more to the vegas' that would be 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.509
 the ventures in big auto then I 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.490
 I want you to put me in the comments 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.259
 What do you think there? I think that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.690
 I will be putting images of all this that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.270
 it seems very good to me and the truth 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.729
 it may just be a simple rumor but 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 the logos were very well done since 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.869
 denote that the letters were as type b 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.759
 city ​​stories can be a simple source 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.530
 of letter but it does not matter what 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.149
 It matters now how to focus a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.610
 bit in all of this large 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.250
 missed because imagine a city in the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.860
 which is in las vegas but already with some 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.600
 very old graphics and with the essence of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.160
 big facto the truth that a big 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.050
 faltón I feel that is what he puts 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.240
 the essence to a console as well what 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.649
 did on playstation 2 that I think is the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 best-selling game san andreas 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.549
 then shows but to me it seems like something 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.570
 pretty good all this great effect 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.539
 Syrian for them 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.090
 and also another thing that I read was that 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.970
 all this what they want to do want 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 reunite your characters in 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.260
 great 50 photos for days indeed not 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.730
 I know if it's not going to be called or how 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.770
 will call but the truth to me 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.390
 it seems quite good since you 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.030
 they know that when they put the characters together 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.520
 and they spend of pets another thing that I saw him 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.820
 that all this history wanted to make a 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.070
 new hit as well as was the one to the bank 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.420
 that left you millions all havoc the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.280
 there are quite a few things that 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.830
 they want to get together in this big missed but 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.590
 The truth is that we will leave it to the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.060
 time and that would be something that the truth 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.150
 it would take quite a big hit to what 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.500
 is doing xbox man and playstation 4 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.470
 this video is more than anything like my 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.330
 opinion about that is not so much from 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.610
 that I affirmed I say in rockstar what 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.980
 you have to take out and the oscar I do not know 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.230
 it's more than anything like my opinion my 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.400
 thought something that could be very 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.290
 good for the next generation 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.810
 so I think I'm going to put it great 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.480
 to the big title photo 50 for davis 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.440
 next interrogation gta then 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.630
 come on you 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.040
 think that you think all this if 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.780
 they want to investigate look for a great 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.850
 future syrian paradise and they will leave 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.260
 some news and other things ok 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.090
 so here I leave you my 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.890
 possibilities all I think about 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.600
 this new grand theft auto 'if that 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.400
 it comes out can be just a simple 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.870
 rumor can be anything there 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.520
