 If you watch this view of the galaxy 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 s4 zoom looks like a phone but it is 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.230
 phone he has a super amolid screen 4 3 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.660

 here one and a half gigabyte nasty 8 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.040
 gigabytes of internal memory

 which can be supplemented with micro sd cards 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.290
 up to 64 gigs and still here the battery is on 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 2330 world is an hour and now let's turn 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.900
 The device I had exactly those emotions when 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.080
 i saw it for the first time it's 16 megapixels 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.130
 camera with flash and here and multiple 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.190
 optical zoom 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.119
 this is the main but not unknowing camera yet 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.990
 there is a front 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.800
 19 megapixel 123 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.020
 Bon is now a full alert camera 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.330
 turning the lens you can push that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.750
 the zoom itself i.e. approach or 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.520
 remove the items you need try 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.950
 what it looks like in practice 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.760
 there is a springs guy ahead of us 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.269
 s4 zoom 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.100
 this is the maximum bob zones as you see 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.620
 can shake a little 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.680
 but when i do the photo shaking is not 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.720
 felt and now we will shake 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.000
 camera so stabilize action like 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.450
 see not so easy to handle 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.450
 the camera still needs to be focused and this 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.750
 quite difficult in motion and with such 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.750
 home 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.730
 let's for example and focus frame but what 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.610
 then we've got the flash was too 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.220
 included but this was all familiar 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.790
 with the most powerful camera phone by the way 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.790
 the market 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.710
