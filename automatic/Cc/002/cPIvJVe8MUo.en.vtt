okay<00:00:00.420> we<00:00:00.599> are<00:00:00.719> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.140> just<00:00:01.740> go<00:00:01.890> over<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.220> flip

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay we are going to just go over a flip

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.340 
okay we are going to just go over a flip
finish<00:00:03.480> really<00:00:03.689> quick<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.080> that's<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
finish really quick and that's the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.840 
finish really quick and that's the
finish<00:00:05.009> where<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.220> dog<00:00:05.339> goes<00:00:05.520> from<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.730> front

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
finish where the dog goes from the front

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.190 
finish where the dog goes from the front
and<00:00:06.120> just<00:00:06.210> swings<00:00:06.540> their<00:00:06.720> butt<00:00:06.870> right<00:00:07.020> into

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
and just swings their butt right into

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.810 
and just swings their butt right into
position<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.980> we've<00:00:08.400> talked<00:00:08.670> about

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
position and we've talked about

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.240 
position and we've talked about
successive<00:00:09.630> approximation<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.830> first

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
successive approximation in the first

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.310 
successive approximation in the first
part<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.849> healing<00:00:12.389> toolbox<00:00:12.840> series<00:00:13.170> for

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
part of this healing toolbox series for

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.169 
part of this healing toolbox series for
the<00:00:13.410> first<00:00:13.590> class<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.700> definition<00:00:15.150> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the first class and the definition is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
the first class and the definition is
also<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.710> are<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:17.070> to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
also in there but we are going to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.939 
also in there but we are going to
approximate<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.570> actually<00:00:18.990> back

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
approximate this and actually back

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.890 
approximate this and actually back
chained<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.060> we're<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> start<00:00:21.660> very

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
chained it so we're going to start very

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.540 
chained it so we're going to start very
close<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> finished<00:00:23.039> behavior

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
close to what the finished behavior

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.400 
close to what the finished behavior
would<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.090> then<00:00:24.570> continue<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> put<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
would be and then continue to put the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.779 
would be and then continue to put the
dog<00:00:25.590> further<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> further<00:00:26.310> from<00:00:26.699> that

dog further and further from that
finished<00:00:27.300> behavior<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.930> reward<00:00:28.500> those<00:00:28.680> steps

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
finished behavior and reward those steps

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410 
finished behavior and reward those steps
are<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> way<00:00:29.400> we're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> use<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> wall

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
are on the way we're going to use a wall

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.130 
are on the way we're going to use a wall
or<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> barrier

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
or a barrier

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.170 
or a barrier
we're<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> set<00:00:32.009> slightly<00:00:32.340> offset<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
we're going to set slightly offset the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.010 
we're going to set slightly offset the
dog<00:00:33.360> out<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.750> position<00:00:34.170> cue<00:00:35.130> them<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.600> op8<00:00:36.600> let

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
dog out of position cue them to op8 let

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.479 
dog out of position cue them to op8 let
them<00:00:37.110> shift<00:00:37.380> back<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> half<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.219> step

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
them shift back just a half a step

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
them shift back just a half a step
reward<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.239> place<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.379> move

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
reward them in place and then as we move

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
reward them in place and then as we move
forward<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.340> show<00:00:41.520> understanding<00:00:41.820> we're

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
forward as they show understanding we're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.529 
forward as they show understanding we're
going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> continue<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.579> modify<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.850> until

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
going to continue to modify that until

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.880 
going to continue to modify that until
they<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.719> closer<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> closer<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> actual

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
they are closer and closer to the actual

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.830 
they are closer and closer to the actual
front<00:00:47.340> position<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
front position so we're going to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
front position so we're going to
sequence<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.469> bunch<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.829> pieces<00:00:50.100> together

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
sequence a bunch of pieces together

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
sequence a bunch of pieces together
ultimately<00:00:51.210> looking<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> dog<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
ultimately looking to get the dog to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
ultimately looking to get the dog to
shift<00:00:52.530> from<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> front<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.430> flip<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:53.910> into

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
shift from the front and flip right into

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
shift from the front and flip right into
position<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> start<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
position but we're going to start at the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.400 
position but we're going to start at the
end<00:00:56.190> result<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.090> well<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.989> it'll<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
end result so well I think it'll make a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
end result so well I think it'll make a
lot<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> sense<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.129> show<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> illustration

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
lot of sense as we show the illustration

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
lot of sense as we show the illustration
of<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.600> we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> wall<00:01:01.680> some

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
of it so we're going to use a wall some

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.479 
of it so we're going to use a wall some
food<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:03.059> approximation<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> first<00:01:05.159> step<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
food in approximation the first step is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.730 
food in approximation the first step is

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
now she knows yes how to work back to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.140 
now she knows yes how to work back to
where<00:02:54.920> she<00:02:54.950> started<00:02:55.610> from<00:02:55.850> where<00:02:56.060> this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
where she started from where this

where she started from where this
exercise<00:02:56.630> exercise<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.560> training

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
exercise exercise of the training

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.430 
exercise exercise of the training
started<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.730> take<00:02:59.150> your<00:02:59.299> time<00:02:59.510> with<00:02:59.720> this<00:02:59.870> know

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
started so take your time with this know

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.770 
started so take your time with this know
that<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.739> are<00:03:00.980> back<00:03:01.519> chaining<00:03:02.120> because<00:03:02.540> this

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
that you are back chaining because this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.240 
that you are back chaining because this
is<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.019> end<00:03:03.170> result<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.829> what<00:03:04.100> we're

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
is the end result and what we're

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.500 
is the end result and what we're
starting<00:03:04.340> from<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.850> essentially<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.360> end

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
starting from is essentially the end

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.000 
starting from is essentially the end
result<00:03:05.840> maybe<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.590> little<00:03:06.620> bit<00:03:06.799> offset

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
result maybe just a little bit offset

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.210 
result maybe just a little bit offset
the<00:03:07.820> dog<00:03:07.970> backs<00:03:08.239> up<00:03:08.420> okay<00:03:08.780> dog<00:03:09.140> backs<00:03:09.350> up<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.160> if

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
the dog backs up okay dog backs up so if

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.539 
the dog backs up okay dog backs up so if
we<00:03:10.370> start<00:03:10.670> from<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.680> finished<00:03:12.680> product<00:03:13.220> and

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
we start from the finished product and

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.370 
we start from the finished product and
work<00:03:13.790> our<00:03:13.970> way<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.510> beginning<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.140> call

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
work our way to the beginning of it call

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.500 
work our way to the beginning of it call
it<00:03:15.500> back<00:03:15.680> changing<00:03:16.100> as<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.250> expert<00:03:16.970> that's<00:03:17.180> used

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
it back changing as a expert that's used

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.500 
it back changing as a expert that's used
commonly<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.200> training<00:03:19.150> process<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.299> used

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
commonly so training process is used

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.440

the dog for the end product and then
build<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.200> pieces<00:03:28.650> back<00:03:28.890> towards<00:03:29.400> the
