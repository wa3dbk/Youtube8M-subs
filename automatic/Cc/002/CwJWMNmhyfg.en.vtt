00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.670
 my people today for eternity 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.430
 recipe show what you already have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.640
 wanted to make longer and that tofu 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.890
 goulash the now I like to like 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 then you can just go instead 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.590
 further take yes ok for everyone in its coming 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.679
 I'm not even a little bit 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.270
 potatoes and vegetables 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.840
 could also vary a bit if 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.460
 you want 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.590
 I have now papa camera and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.340
 mushrooms and leeks for example zucchini 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.719
 can you take or pea or 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.730
 Pumpkin for example also fits very well 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.829
 In Gohlis I find first we can 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.770
 cut the onions small 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.710
 how can you be a little bit tall ? 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:00.020
 no small dice so the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.020
 cut half to four times sugar 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.980
 to prepare the usa 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 Basically now every vegetable could be in 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.590
 about the same size as cut 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.860
 which you have also cut onions, the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.850
 You can easily lose mushrooms and in 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.850
 cut relatively thin slices 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.619
 The leek you can just in thin 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.530
 slice and the tofu are the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.299
 now 200 grams 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.360
 you can just put it in dice 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.360
 to cut 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.460
 about 1 times 1 centimeter tall then 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.579
 you need a relatively large pot 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.560
 good drink colleagues want one wants it 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.040
 It says you can do that for the first time 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 give 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.520
 the most important one needed 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.540
 generated electricity 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.180
 and that's why the cylinders are 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.180
 injected this vision girlfriend 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.290
 deficits could be reduced to 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:19.960
 heat down a little bit 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:21.670
 switch to about 714 as well 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.370
 already a pretty good driver onions 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.840
 we assumed we could do that about then 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.320
 you too already the two men too 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.360
 give 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:37.720
 with analysts even a few more 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.610
 minutes you can also bring the loud 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:49.020
 Add and should you really the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.020
 whole events very dark 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.170
 and then I have sugar here 2 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.459
 Tablespoon tomato the law 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.150
 and that will then also stir 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.150
 nicely grown 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:17.090
 maka agreed and pretty much in frankfurt 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.470
 o maten taste but if every nice 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.620
 then upgrades this taste 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.680
 also a bit tenor and gets 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.450
 a nice plus at roma could be here 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.490
 on the bottom of the pot a bit if it is 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:35.570
 must not bad could 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:38.410
 now he would also be in the 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.410
 sauce added 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.130
 I'm a bit 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.810
 have done and is also formed 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.760
 if a sweetish smell 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.760
 you need a bit of soy sauce 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.350
 completely cook 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.390
 that could red again first 23 times 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.109
 If you want you can now also 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:16.310
 little red wine, there are please to 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.310
 only for giving the book 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:36.940
 almost at the same time also the mushrooms and the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:38.110
 press and the whole thing starts playing 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.200
 Can you just about the heat 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.060
 could reduce to half 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.150
 about 1 teaspoon paprika powder 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.690
 Add and if you like a small one 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.690
 spoon tip 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.650
 now you can nevertheless times about 200 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.120
 Add milliliters of water 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.440
 the copper city first on whole 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.500
 heat cover and cover him 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.310
 then about a quarter of an hour easy 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.310
 to simmer 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.190
 so should already be enough in the reason 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.020
 we can still do that now if you want 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.690
 a little bit thick at the end 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.490
 already become by itself and indeed 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.140
 with about half a tablespoon 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.950
 Strengthen a bit of cold water 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.590
 stirred and boil once 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.330
 I bet, however, to let and before 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.040
 By the way, you can cook before 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.080
 you can of course already cooked 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.950
 her also a few dried herbs 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.669
 add 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.700
 rosemary or marjoram or whatever you like 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:50.730
 I like to have it without it 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:50.730
 let it cost so maybe again 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.310
 yes tastes very delicious in any case 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.930
 just like a year should taste 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.960
 very spicy and a bit aware of me 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.980
 it always yes as I said you can 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.800
 even with time then make in the reason 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.060
 just as you like which pages 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.610
 So use that out of the glass 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.890
 probably a bit small or 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.990
 to go with his text for example too 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:25.630
 by just sounding a bit 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:32.350
 take some lupe and then some tomato paste 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:33.870
 in the family yes okay we wish a lot 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.040
 have fun while participating 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.040
 yes you are not even
