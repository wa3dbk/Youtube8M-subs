00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.259
 very good all are equal gamer and I 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.959
 We were going to play a dispute trying out the new 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.730
 exceptional shotgun expletive here the 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:10.230
 You see I got it lucky to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.959
 completing an exceptional contract makes 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.329
 little and let's see how I'm playing 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.849
 dispute that is all against all not 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.550
 I usually play and more than anything 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.080
 to play crucible I'm good I'm not good no 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.939
 I want to believe that I'm good I do not know about 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.439
 those people but I think I'm going to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.240
 distribute a lot even though I'm 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.869
 commenting on life I do not even have the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.730
 volume in arrived and I do not know but I'm going to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 do the best you could right now here 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 we have someone if I have to use the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.310
 I will use assault rifle 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.150
 obviously I have an important advantage 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.040
 to use with the shotgun and it's this 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.170
 teleport and as a focus I do not 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 You will kill in the first death fuck 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.930
 be hateful god or god 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.620
 if you are closer than you thought to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.809
 psuv price focal mode 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.550
 I say good, I have not told you but 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.710
 not being nothing has improved no shotgun 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.719
 is not at all improved and my rifle 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.150
 Assault, do not ask and 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.920
 I need green ammunition this is a great 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.540
 problem if you want to make an example and only 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.310
 with the shotgun what you are looking for 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.820
 ammunition constantly here I think that 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.619
 I have and so I charge this son 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.229
 As a bitch I already have her name on 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.270
 serious to this I do not know who was the uncle that 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.340
 I was fighting in the last game 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.170
 that the psuv and I think it was burj and I think 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.149
 that was die so rural that even 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.410

 that's the fucking to not a camper is a 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.550
 because I do not think that I have 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.520
 great luck I have let's kill this 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.140
 third visitor that also here I 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.050
 I'm having a good time in this example and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.620
 I'm passing it my god oh my god 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.270

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.120
 left that would have been a good 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.400
 run my god I'm going well 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.900
 this well we are going to distribute these 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.820
 disputes and that I do not have a team of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.440
 shit that can make me lose like that 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.020
 I'm going to do what I can to win 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.840
 it's going to be a host gameplay if 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.000
 everything is fine and rex the fuck champion 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.860
 is the one that is winning but guess what 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.140
 you can not win a game by changing 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.060
 the truth is that yes but that they give them 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.480
 ass to the campers is worth here in a 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.430
 second visitor or the same nothing 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.080
 it loads one post morten I do not know if it had 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.350
 some activated post-mortem challenge 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.350
 Peru 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.620
 once that is the trick to 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.930
 teleportation goes from hates hatred I thought 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.460
 I was going to get lucky again and I'm going to 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.660
 say that once from the global feet of 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.160
 transport voucher 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.110
 joaquin mother to kill to suit them 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.100
 because you can approach them very 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.190
 fast and the approaches of a network well is 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.770
 for me 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.350
 is that one side dies thanks and 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.440

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.940

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.380
 say all the time is winning I do not know to 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.550
 how many are the items of dispute not 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.380
 can do a lot because we already have 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.640
 half of the score so there's 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:34.270
 to put the batteries cool seriously 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.600
 shit 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.190
 goodbye goodbye thanks to the shit seriously 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.050
 it does not kill it or it is not left a 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.030
 good life shit and I tell you that no 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.800
 I have no improved weapon so let's go 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.940
 to catch this we are going to catch a bit of 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.940
 advantage that I need it 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:57.430
 I do not know what the fuck you did to fail 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.650
 but how lucky I'm having to fuck what 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.880
 luck I'm going to go through this a lot of people 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.890
 You do not know that you can cross or 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.800
 shoot through it and they do not and 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.150
 It is wrong just because they can bump you 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.910
 that I thought I had the folders 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.650
 hit four selected shots to see 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.050
 I do not have a few bullets left of this we are going to 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.810
 you have to learn the sites of 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.639
 ammunition true be good yes yes I am 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.620
 if you use more secondary weapons 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.219
 you 're down here you 're up here only 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.219
 year is this list 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.310
 I have no fucking idea that this is 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.530
 down here where more 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.270
 marica this is the other country that 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.760
 they were undoing being invisible by 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.470
 I'm winning there 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.470
 gamer you speak has advantage 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.400
 what a bastard has jumped right that I already 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.980
 have failed the two attacks of this 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.080
 well that shit or not no no no no what 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.860
 I do with my life and already street takes focus 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.270
 Audio 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.580
 but we're winning so we're going to 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.590
 focus power we're going to focus on the 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.810
 mind my god the things that I am 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.720
 doing is that it is in random of sting 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.940
 and that there are times that I stay blank 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.890
 when these things happen , we're going to 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.480
 catch more ammo still and I think with 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.450
 this ammunition to good I already had it at 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.710
 maximum hello this is the campero that by 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.870
 first time in his life he was not 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.870
 changing and you see how he had gone 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.379
 s 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.389

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.169

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.819
 it's bad I understand is wrong or everything 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.180
 It depends on who is more 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.550

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.530
