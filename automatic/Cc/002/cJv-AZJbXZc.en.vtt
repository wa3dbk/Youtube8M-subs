00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.290 

here<00:00:01.050> we<00:00:01.199> have<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.530> water<00:00:01.829> research<00:00:02.399> system

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
here we have the water research system

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.990 
here we have the water research system
for<00:00:03.570> my<00:00:03.720> pool<00:00:03.959> I<00:00:04.830> looked<00:00:05.549> all<00:00:05.700> over<00:00:05.759> the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
for my pool I looked all over the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.570 
for my pool I looked all over the
internet<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:07.140> try<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> find<00:00:07.830> some<00:00:08.130> precise

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
internet to try to find some precise

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.950 
internet to try to find some precise
information<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:09.330> how<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.480> put<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.900> stuff

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
information on how to put this stuff

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.930 
information on how to put this stuff
together<00:00:10.290> because<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.920> was<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> first-time<00:00:11.610> pool

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
together because I was a first-time pool

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.910 
together because I was a first-time pool
owner<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.719> couldn't<00:00:13.500> really<00:00:13.650> find

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
owner and I couldn't really find

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.480 
owner and I couldn't really find
anything<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:15.470> after<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> lot<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.740> searching<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
anything so after a lot of searching and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.670 
anything so after a lot of searching and
asking<00:00:17.730> questions<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> job<00:00:19.410> done<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
asking questions I got the job done and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.010 
asking questions I got the job done and
now<00:00:20.039> I'm<00:00:20.279> making<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.699> video<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.060> help<00:00:21.750> some

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
now I'm making a video to help some

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.410 
now I'm making a video to help some
other<00:00:22.170> poor<00:00:22.470> soul<00:00:22.850> try<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.119> through<00:00:24.300> this

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
other poor soul try to get through this

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.890 
other poor soul try to get through this
stuff

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
stuff

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529 
stuff
so<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> water<00:00:26.310> comes<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.359> pool

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so here the water comes out of the pool

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.919 
so here the water comes out of the pool
we<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> little<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.490> put<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> valve<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
we have a little I put a valve here and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.170 
we have a little I put a valve here and
I<00:00:31.140> also<00:00:31.320> put<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> valve<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> inlet<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I also put a valve on the inlet of the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.260 
I also put a valve on the inlet of the
pool<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:34.410> facilitate<00:00:35.130> draining<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
pool to facilitate draining and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.260 
pool to facilitate draining and
what-have-you<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:38.399> back<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> water

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
what-have-you so going back to the water

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
what-have-you so going back to the water
out<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> pool<00:00:40.140> goes<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:41.040> through<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
out of the pool goes down through this

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.279 
out of the pool goes down through this
pipe<00:00:41.989> first<00:00:42.989> stop<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.340> research<00:00:44.760> pump<00:00:45.289> here

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
pipe first stop the research pump here

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.540 
pipe first stop the research pump here
we<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.559> another<00:00:46.739> shutoff<00:00:48.410> then<00:00:49.410> as<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.370> can

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
we have another shutoff then as you can

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.270 
we have another shutoff then as you can
see<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.750> where<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> put<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
see right here this is where I put the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.590 
see right here this is where I put the
feed<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.980> my<00:00:55.980> water<00:00:56.610> slide<00:00:56.940> which<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.239> over

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
feed to my water slide which is over

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500 
feed to my water slide which is over
there<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.609> told<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
there so I was told that this is the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
there so I was told that this is the
point<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> highest<00:01:01.469> pressure<00:01:02.000> therefore

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
point of the highest pressure therefore

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.289 
point of the highest pressure therefore
I<00:01:03.510> install<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> tee<00:01:04.369> with<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> tap<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
I install the tee with a tap and this

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.020 
I install the tee with a tap and this
tap<00:01:06.600> regulates<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.710> pressure<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.850> water

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
tap regulates the pressure of the water

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.050 
tap regulates the pressure of the water
coming<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:11.070> little<00:01:11.340> outlet<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
coming out of the little outlet on the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
coming out of the little outlet on the
pool<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> pool<00:01:13.140> slide<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:13.890> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
pool on the pool slide over there so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
pool on the pool slide over there so
here<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.000> had<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> other<00:01:15.509> end<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> hose

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here we had the other end of the hose

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
here we had the other end of the hose
that's<00:01:16.680> coming<00:01:17.070> from<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.640> pressure

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that's coming from the pressure

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
that's coming from the pressure
regulated<00:01:18.750> water<00:01:19.200> valve<00:01:19.470> over<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
regulated water valve over there at the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.330 
regulated water valve over there at the
water<00:01:20.490> pump<00:01:20.790> area<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.159> see

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
water pump area so that's as you can see

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
water pump area so that's as you can see
the<00:01:23.400> standard<00:01:23.909> garden<00:01:24.090> hose<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.450> there's<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the standard garden hose and there's a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.620 
the standard garden hose and there's a
regular<00:01:25.350> inline<00:01:25.740> shutoff<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.299> shutoff

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
regular inline shutoff so this shutoff

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.270 
regular inline shutoff so this shutoff
will<00:01:27.810> basically<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.409> shut<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.250> water

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
will basically just shut off the water

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
will basically just shut off the water
the<00:01:29.790> other<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.420> over<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.630> regulates<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the other one over there regulates the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
the other one over there regulates the
pressure<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
pressure and then here we have a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
pressure and then here we have a
standard<00:01:33.659> adaptor<00:01:34.350> from<00:01:34.560> garden<00:01:34.979> hose<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
standard adaptor from garden hose to I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.429 
standard adaptor from garden hose to I
believe<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:37.009> five<00:01:38.009> eighths<00:01:38.340> water<00:01:38.759> line

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
believe that's five eighths water line

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.429 
believe that's five eighths water line
so<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.829> comes<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.439> then

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
so that just comes up here and then

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.530 
so that just comes up here and then
around<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:44.729> goes<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.299> this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
around here and then goes into this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.830 
around here and then goes into this
little<00:01:45.600> outlet<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.909> that's<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> water

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
little outlet and that's it the water

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.950 
little outlet and that's it the water
comes<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:50.450> onto<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> slide<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> okay<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.570> here

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
comes out onto the slide so okay so here

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.380 
comes out onto the slide so okay so here
we<00:01:55.110> follow<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.090> sand<00:01:57.509> filter

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
we follow you go to the sand filter

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.140 
we follow you go to the sand filter
there<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.600> come<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> sand<00:02:01.500> filter<00:02:02.150> and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
there we come out of the sand filter and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.590 
there we come out of the sand filter and
we<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.450> into<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.520> H<00:02:05.520> assembly<00:02:06.330> here

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
we go into this little H assembly here

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.529 
we go into this little H assembly here
at<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.200> inlet<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.740> air<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.940> water<00:02:09.119> heat

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
at the inlet of the air to water heat

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.890 
at the inlet of the air to water heat
pump<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:11.030> now<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.270> here<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> was

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
pump that I have now this here I was

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.320 
pump that I have now this here I was
told<00:02:13.080> wasn't<00:02:13.500> really<00:02:13.739> necessary<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:15.209> it's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
told wasn't really necessary but it's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.650 
told wasn't really necessary but it's
nice<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.569> have<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.920> want<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> bypass<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
nice to have if you want to bypass the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.350 
nice to have if you want to bypass the
water<00:02:18.959> circulating<00:02:19.680> into<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> heat<00:02:20.250> pump<00:02:20.489> so

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
water circulating into the heat pump so

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.410 
water circulating into the heat pump so
you<00:02:21.390> basically<00:02:21.900> open<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.700> open<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.209> valve

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
you basically open you open this valve

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.270 
you basically open you open this valve
and<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.810> shut<00:02:25.080> these<00:02:25.260> two<00:02:25.500> off<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.040> water

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and you shut these two off and the water

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.690 
and you shut these two off and the water
will<00:02:26.580> not<00:02:26.760> go<00:02:26.970> into<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.450> oh<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.489> can't

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
will not go into there oh and I can't

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.009 
will not go into there oh and I can't
forget<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.180> equipment<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.750> quick

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
forget the equipment the quick

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.140 
forget the equipment the quick
disconnects<00:02:31.650> everywhere<00:02:32.100> down<00:02:32.519> there<00:02:32.850> up

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
disconnects everywhere down there up

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.300 
disconnects everywhere down there up
here<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:35.390> here<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.569> all<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.650> plumbing<00:02:38.100> stuff

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
here and here so all this plumbing stuff

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.160 
here and here so all this plumbing stuff
can<00:02:38.580> be<00:02:38.610> brought<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.720> winter<00:02:39.989> because

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
can be brought in for the winter because

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.309 
can be brought in for the winter because
we<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> very<00:02:40.920> harsh<00:02:41.340> winter<00:02:41.670> over<00:02:42.000> here<00:02:42.180> in

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
we have a very harsh winter over here in

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.009 
we have a very harsh winter over here in
Eastern<00:02:43.319> Canada<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> coming<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.870> heat

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
Eastern Canada so coming out of the heat

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.910 
Eastern Canada so coming out of the heat
pump<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.620> hose<00:02:50.450> was<00:02:51.450> underneath<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
pump the hose was underneath there and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.289 
pump the hose was underneath there and
it<00:02:53.069> goes<00:02:53.190> into<00:02:53.459> these<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.299> aqua<00:02:55.260> cell<00:02:56.299> salt

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
it goes into these this aqua cell salt

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.190 
it goes into these this aqua cell salt
system<00:02:59.299> again<00:03:00.299> quick<00:03:00.660> disconnects

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
system again quick disconnects

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.900 
system again quick disconnects
everywhere<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:03.269> then<00:03:03.780> from<00:03:04.019> there<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.700> goes

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
everywhere and then from there it goes

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.539 
everywhere and then from there it goes
into<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.560> inlet<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.030> pool<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:10.430> there<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
into the inlet of the pool and there you

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.140 
into the inlet of the pool and there you
have<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.209> research<00:03:12.660> system<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:14.150> I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
have it that's the research system and I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.699 
have it that's the research system and I
take<00:03:15.540> all<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.870> stuff<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> wintertime

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
take all this stuff in in the wintertime

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.290 
take all this stuff in in the wintertime
like<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.280> said
