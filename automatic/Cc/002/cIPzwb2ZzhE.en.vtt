you how to make an a to swivel card that

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.480 
you how to make an a to swivel card that
has<00:00:04.470> motion<00:00:05.040> like<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:10.099> if<00:00:11.099> you've<00:00:11.309> ever

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
has motion like this if you've ever

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.160 
has motion like this if you've ever
tried<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.790> make<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.300> these<00:00:12.420> without<00:00:12.660> using

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
tried to make one of these without using

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.530 
tried to make one of these without using
a<00:00:13.259> template<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.450> to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a template like the one I'm going to

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.260 
a template like the one I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:15.839> today<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.850> you'll<00:00:17.850> realize<00:00:18.240> that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
demonstrate today is you'll realize that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.060 
demonstrate today is you'll realize that
this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.690> quite<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> nightmare<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.740> trying<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
this is quite a nightmare in trying to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.620 
this is quite a nightmare in trying to
figure<00:00:20.310> out<00:00:20.369> where<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> put<00:00:20.880> these<00:00:21.060> images<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
figure out where to put these images and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.330 
figure out where to put these images and
how<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> put<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.590> fold<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> cuts<00:00:25.340> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
how to put the the fold and the cuts so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.830 
how to put the the fold and the cuts so
this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> template<00:00:27.300> I'm<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> use

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
this is the template I'm going to use

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080 
this is the template I'm going to use
for<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.500> swivel<00:00:29.039> card<00:00:29.369> I've<00:00:29.760> laid

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
for this the a to swivel card I've laid

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.910 
for this the a to swivel card I've laid
it<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> dark<00:00:30.810> piece<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> cardstock<00:00:31.560> so

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it here on a dark piece of cardstock so

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.510 
it here on a dark piece of cardstock so
that<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:33.829> some<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> lines<00:00:35.219> in

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that you can see some of the lines in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.069 
that you can see some of the lines in
here<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.570> works

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
here and how it works

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.860 
here and how it works
so<00:00:37.700> normally<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.270> place<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.690> on

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so normally what I do is I place this on

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.510 
so normally what I do is I place this on
a<00:00:39.899> piece<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.320> cardstock<00:00:40.620> over<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
a piece of cardstock over here in the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
a piece of cardstock over here in the
factory<00:00:41.790> edge<00:00:42.239> corner<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> don't<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
factory edge corner so I don't have to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
factory edge corner so I don't have to
make<00:00:44.100> those<00:00:44.370> two<00:00:44.610> cuts<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.110> trace

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
make those two cuts and then I trace

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
make those two cuts and then I trace
around<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.129> perimeter<00:00:47.670> there's<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> couple

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
around the perimeter there's a couple

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
around the perimeter there's a couple
little<00:00:49.320> carrots<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.340> want<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> mark

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
little carrots here you want to mark

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
little carrots here you want to mark
those<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.629> they're<00:00:51.870> indices<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> will

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
those because they're indices that will

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
those because they're indices that will
tell<00:00:52.980> us<00:00:53.100> where<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> put<00:00:53.550> our<00:00:53.579> folds<00:00:54.210> here's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
tell us where to put our folds here's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
tell us where to put our folds here's
another<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> another<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
another one and another one up here and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.510 
another one and another one up here and
then<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> want<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> trace<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.309> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
then you want to trace in here this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.349 
then you want to trace in here this
little<00:00:59.840> half<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.020> box<00:01:01.320> looking<00:01:01.859> thing<00:01:02.359> over

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
little half a box looking thing over

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.770 
little half a box looking thing over
here<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:04.850> these<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.060> l-shaped

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
here and here these little l-shaped

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
here and here these little l-shaped
pieces<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.439> used<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.890> layering<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
pieces are used for layering and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
pieces are used for layering and
positioning<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.420> I'll<00:01:09.510> show<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> those<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
positioning and I'll show you those in a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
positioning and I'll show you those in a
moment<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.610> you're<00:01:11.790> done<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
moment so when you're done with that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.840 
moment so when you're done with that
step<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:14.040> end<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> piece<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
step you end up with a piece of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.630 
step you end up with a piece of
cardstock<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.509> looks<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.610> what<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
cardstock that looks like this what you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
cardstock that looks like this what you
want<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.330> where<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.290> at

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
want to do is where we have these at

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
want to do is where we have these at
these<00:01:19.890> half<00:01:20.369> box<00:01:20.820> looking<00:01:21.360> things<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.320> want

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
these half box looking things you want

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.609 
these half box looking things you want
to<00:01:22.590> cut<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.040> using<00:01:23.610> an<00:01:23.759> exacto<00:01:24.409> cut<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to cut those using an exacto cut that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.450 
to cut those using an exacto cut that
and<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.530> look<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.890> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and so they look like this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.950 
and so they look like this
you'll<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.540> finished

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you'll have this one you get finished

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560 
you'll have this one you get finished
that<00:01:31.110> cut<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:32.670> those<00:01:32.820> little<00:01:32.909> carrots

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that cut and then those little carrots

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.700 
that cut and then those little carrots
that<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.810> told<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.259> those<00:01:34.500> little

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that I told you about those little

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.120 
that I told you about those little
indices<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> are<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
indices that are right here and here you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490 
indices that are right here and here you
want<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> take<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> straight<00:01:39.030> edge<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:40.320> use

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
want to take a straight edge you can use

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.560 
want to take a straight edge you can use
the<00:01:40.650> edge<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.130> template<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.390> want

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the edge of this template and you want

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200 
the edge of this template and you want
to<00:01:42.659> line<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.170> perfectly<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.030> can

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
to line it up perfectly and then you can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
to line it up perfectly and then you can
score<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> use<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> crochet<00:01:46.590> needle<00:01:46.680> quite<00:01:47.189> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
score it I use a crochet needle quite a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
score it I use a crochet needle quite a

there so the next part what I want to
show<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.740> how<00:02:32.980> how<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.940> use<00:02:34.120> these<00:02:34.270> little

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
show you is how how to use these little

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.240 
show you is how how to use these little
l-shaped<00:02:34.780> pieces<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.830> perfect

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
l-shaped pieces to get the perfect

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.530 
l-shaped pieces to get the perfect
positioning<00:02:36.730> cuz<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.270> where<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
positioning cuz this is where the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.350 
positioning cuz this is where the
nightmare<00:02:38.020> is<00:02:38.280> where<00:02:39.280> where<00:02:39.820> do<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:40.000> position

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
nightmare is where where do you position

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
nightmare is where where do you position
this<00:02:40.900> image<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.700> panel<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:44.230> it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
this image on this panel so that it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.470 
this image on this panel so that it
shows<00:02:44.620> up<00:02:44.890> when<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.220> when<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.820> use<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.210> card

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
shows up when you when you use the card

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.310 
shows up when you when you use the card
like<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> way<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.210> do<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.840> you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
like so so the way you do that is you

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.540 
like so so the way you do that is you
use<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.680> template<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:51.490> markings<00:02:52.320> and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
use the template and it's markings and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.940 
use the template and it's markings and
over<00:02:54.550> here<00:02:54.790> there's<00:02:55.230> they're<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.440> they<00:02:56.770> make

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
over here there's they're like they make

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.060 
over here there's they're like they make
their<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.130> corners<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.970> box<00:02:58.830> right<00:02:59.830> here

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
their the corners of a box right here

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.580 
their the corners of a box right here
you<00:03:00.580> can<00:03:00.730> see<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.120> my<00:03:01.240> photo<00:03:01.540> falls<00:03:02.080> in<00:03:02.380> line

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
you can see that my photo falls in line

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.790 
you can see that my photo falls in line
with<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.250> four<00:03:03.460> boxes<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:05.260> that's<00:03:05.590> how<00:03:05.770> I

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
with the four boxes and and that's how I

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.010 
with the four boxes and and that's how I
size<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.520> would<00:03:06.670> lay<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.360> photograph

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
size it I would lay this on a photograph

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.540 
size it I would lay this on a photograph
and<00:03:08.320> then<00:03:08.410> just<00:03:08.740> make<00:03:08.890> sure<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.100> have<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.400> right

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
and then just make sure I have the right

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.330 
and then just make sure I have the right
size<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.360> then<00:03:10.990> when<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.170> go<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.440> position<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.130> I

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
size and then when I go to position it I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.340 
size and then when I go to position it I
would<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:12.760> make<00:03:13.060> little<00:03:13.300> indices<00:03:14.050> right

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
would just make little indices right

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.560 
would just make little indices right
here<00:03:14.740> just<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.430> make<00:03:15.640> sure<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:16.060> I've<00:03:16.209> landed

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.870 
so I've got double layers the photo sits
on<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.140> layer<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.680> that's<00:03:33.220> what<00:03:33.400> gives<00:03:33.520> me<00:03:33.670> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
on a layer and that's what gives me the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.310 
on a layer and that's what gives me the
size<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:35.200> on<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.470> other<00:03:35.590> side<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.720> this

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
size now on the other side this is this

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.850 
size now on the other side this is this
flap<00:03:38.880> when<00:03:39.880> this<00:03:40.030> opens<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.630> closes<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.650> is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
flap when this opens and closes this is

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.670 
flap when this opens and closes this is
like<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:42.880> it's<00:03:43.060> open<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.080> positioning

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
like this so it's open the positioning

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.979 
like this so it's open the positioning
is<00:03:44.739> not<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.100> important<00:03:45.640> but<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.510> indices

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
is not that important but the indices

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.380 
is not that important but the indices
are<00:03:47.050> here<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.830> you<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.100> figure<00:03:48.370> out<00:03:48.489> what

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
are here so that you can figure out what

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.090 
are here so that you can figure out what
the<00:03:49.540> layer<00:03:49.750> should<00:03:50.140> be<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.560> wanted<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.980> do

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
the layer should be if you wanted to do

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.970 
the layer should be if you wanted to do
the<00:03:51.220> layers<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.580> four<00:03:52.060> on<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.330> outside<00:03:52.980> would

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
the layers the four on the outside would

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.400 
the layers the four on the outside would
correspond<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.880> piece<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:56.350> size

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
correspond to a piece this size

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.260 
correspond to a piece this size
so<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.620> template<00:03:59.069> makes<00:03:59.430> making<00:03:59.790> an<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.209> to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
so this template makes making an a to

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.380 
so this template makes making an a to
swivel<00:04:00.810> card<00:04:01.200> very<00:04:01.830> simple<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.730> easy<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.180> do

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
swivel card very simple and easy to do

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.729 
swivel card very simple and easy to do
this<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.560> what<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.830> end<00:04:05.040> up<00:04:05.190> with<00:04:06.739> there's

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
this is what you end up with there's

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.420 
this is what you end up with there's
another<00:04:08.040> one<00:04:08.280> without<00:04:09.270> any<00:04:09.599> photos<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.319> it

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
another one without any photos in it

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.310 
another one without any photos in it
just<00:04:11.430> put<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> nice<00:04:11.880> saying<00:04:12.239> over<00:04:12.660> there<00:04:15.320> fits

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
just put a nice saying over there fits

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.670 
just put a nice saying over there fits
inside<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.709> standard<00:04:17.310> a2<00:04:17.459> card<00:04:18.230> this<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.290> just

inside of standard a2 card this is just

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.790 
inside of standard a2 card this is just
another<00:04:19.919> quick<00:04:20.220> sample<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:22.079> another<00:04:22.620> one

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800
