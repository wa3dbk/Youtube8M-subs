I won't be able to use it on this one

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.200 
I won't be able to use it on this one
because<00:00:04.740> it's<00:00:04.859> not<00:00:04.890> rasterizer<00:00:05.430> okay<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
because it's not rasterizer okay and

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.379 
because it's not rasterizer okay and
let's<00:00:07.109> do<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.099> can<00:00:08.460> work<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:08.820> it

Islanders I'll explain what all that
stuff<00:00:11.580> means<00:00:12.410> another<00:00:13.410> point<00:00:13.679> while<00:00:13.950> we're

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
stuff means another point while we're

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.910 
stuff means another point while we're
not<00:00:14.849> when<00:00:15.420> we're<00:00:15.570> doing<00:00:15.809> something<00:00:16.049> with

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
not when we're doing something with

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.599 
not when we're doing something with
rasterizing<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.180> later<00:00:18.630> tutorial

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
rasterizing in a later tutorial

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.720 
rasterizing in a later tutorial
so<00:00:20.810> like<00:00:21.810> there's<00:00:22.710> these<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.039> little<00:00:23.250> spots

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
white background if I take turn that off

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.449 
white background if I take turn that off
you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.380> see<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> goes<00:02:10.920> back<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
you can see it goes back to the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
you can see it goes back to the
transparent<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.110> eraser

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
transparent so that's what the eraser

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.170 
transparent so that's what the eraser
tool<00:02:13.650> does<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.220> erases<00:02:14.519> whatever's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
tool does it just erases whatever's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.790 
tool does it just erases whatever's
there<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.050> right<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.500> we've<00:02:19.680> got

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
there and to the right here we've got

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.170 
there and to the right here we've got
our<00:02:19.860> paint<00:02:20.190> bucket<00:02:20.489> tool<00:02:20.519> which<00:02:21.000> fills<00:02:21.390> in

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
our paint bucket tool which fills in

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.100 
our paint bucket tool which fills in
solid<00:02:24.180> color<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:24.959> our

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
solid color and then we have our

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.600 
solid color and then we have our
gradient<00:02:25.380> tool<00:02:25.590> which<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.069> kind<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
gradient tool which is kind of like the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.910 
gradient tool which is kind of like the
paint<00:02:26.850> bucket<00:02:27.060> tool<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:27.690> doesn't<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> solid

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
paint bucket tool but doesn't do a solid

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.040 
paint bucket tool but doesn't do a solid
color<00:02:29.250> does<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.580> gradient<00:02:29.940> color<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:31.019> you

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
color does a gradient color but you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.479 
color does a gradient color but you
could<00:02:31.290> make<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> solid<00:02:31.950> color<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.400> you

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
could make it to a solid color if you

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.360 
could make it to a solid color if you
wanted<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.600> there's<00:02:34.010> might<00:02:35.010> as<00:02:35.069> well<00:02:35.190> just

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
wanted to but there's might as well just

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.530 
wanted to but there's might as well just
use<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.550> paint<00:02:35.760> bucket<00:02:35.910> tool<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:37.190> now

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
use the paint bucket tool for that now

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.690 
use the paint bucket tool for that now
beneath<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.459> our<00:02:42.530> Dodge<00:02:43.530> burn<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
that into your photos so if I use this

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.910 
that into your photos so if I use this
Dodge<00:02:54.239> tool<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.200> do<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.680> girl's

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
Dodge tool and I do it on this girl's

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.080 
Dodge tool and I do it on this girl's
arm<00:02:57.470> admit<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.890> making<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.400> making<00:03:00.000> her

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
arm admit this is making it making her

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.059 
arm admit this is making it making her
arm<00:03:00.299> like<00:03:00.540> way<00:03:00.750> lighter<00:03:01.019> as<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.650> see

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.720 

and<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.599> use<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.469> burn<00:03:07.709> tool<00:03:08.040> I'll

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
and if I use like the burn tool I'll

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.839 
and if I use like the burn tool I'll
probably<00:03:08.969> make<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.269> darker<00:03:09.689> yep<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.640> has

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
probably make a darker yep so that has

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.270 
probably make a darker yep so that has
made<00:03:11.879> her<00:03:12.209> arm<00:03:12.420> darker<00:03:15.409> so<00:03:16.409> left<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.069> we

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
made her arm darker so left of that we

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.849 
made her arm darker so left of that we
have<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.790> blur<00:03:18.629> and<00:03:18.959> sharpen<00:03:19.579> tools<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:21.859> I'm

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
have the blur and sharpen tools and I'm

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.500 
have the blur and sharpen tools and I'm
sure<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.159> guys<00:03:23.310> know<00:03:23.340> what<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> blur<00:03:23.939> is<00:03:24.150> it'll

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
sure you guys know what a blur is it'll

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.420 
sure you guys know what a blur is it'll
just<00:03:24.689> blur<00:03:24.930> out<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.439> area<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.069> sharpen

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
just blur out the area and the sharpen

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.860 
just blur out the area and the sharpen
will<00:03:26.579> make<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.879> a<00:03:26.909> less<00:03:27.150> blurry<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.659> then<00:03:27.780> we

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
will make it a less blurry and then we

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.129 
will make it a less blurry and then we
got<00:03:27.989> our<00:03:28.019> smudge<00:03:28.439> which<00:03:29.189> will<00:03:29.930> smear<00:03:30.930> around

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
got our smudge which will smear around

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.610 
got our smudge which will smear around
everything<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.139> now<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.200> can<00:03:34.469> see

got a couple more left so try to speed

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.460 
got a couple more left so try to speed
through<00:03:41.849> these<00:03:42.030> we've<00:03:42.629> got<00:03:42.840> our<00:03:43.019> different

through these we've got our different

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.259 
through these we've got our different
selection<00:03:44.040> tools<00:03:44.280> here<00:03:44.549> we've<00:03:44.700> got<00:03:44.879> our<00:03:44.939> path

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
selection tools here we've got our path
