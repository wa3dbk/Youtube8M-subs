00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 all big hi my name is Ilya and to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.290
 We got a very interesting review 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.150
 gamepad from the company alpika on him we 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.550
 Today let's see the first thing 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.769
 note this low price of it 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
 device that frankly compared to 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.270
 competitors from famous manufacturers 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.180
 real pennies let's say the same controller 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.039
 worth a lot under 5000 rubles in general 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.449
 ipega makes the buyer very 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.980
 tempting offer 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.779
 now let's see what 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.289
 the buyer will receive for these modest 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.570
 money 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.000
 Let's start with the appearance and build quality 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.219
 made the device from pleasant to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.649
 touch and soft touch plastic in itself 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.629
 gamepad light it's good after all when in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 you insert the smartphone total weight 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.129
 the whole structure does not bother much 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 hands with prolonged gaming words in 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.140
 gamepad can insert device with 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.940
 up to five and a half inches 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 hands at least in my gamepad 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 all the elements are very good 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.480
 controls are conveniently arranged and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.460
 spaced along the surface of the device 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.260
 I note that in random or inaccurate 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 taps during testing not 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.979
 there was an arrangement of organs 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.200
 control almost completely 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.930
 copied from the iXbox AVC controller 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.909
 arrangement of cross sticks and buttons 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.060
 action is almost identical 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.740
 x-box 360 controller except 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.869
 additional multimedia series 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.869
 the buttons of the buttons these buttons turned out to be very 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.729
 comfortable and sometimes even irreplaceable except 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.580
 I would like to note this nice 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.619
 smooth and accurate stick stitches don't 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.390
 very pleased well and to finish with 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.970
 controls want to draw your 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.210
 attention to another difference controller 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.119
 and ipega by x-box controller 360 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.000
 I 'm talking about these parks now 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.860
 more precisely, they are very ordinary their location 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.420
 the arrangement of the trigger first 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.610
 unusual and even somewhat uncomfortable 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 however you get used to it after a couple 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.520
 hours of play as for bumpers 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.859
 all habitual enough mundane 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.049
 not located in their places and no 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.210
 surprises in themselves do not hide in general 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.670
 controls and their operation to me 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.979
 I like it, they work out clearly 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.140
 pressing and perfectly perform their 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.590
 functions with controls 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.929
 everything 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.690
 it remains only to mention three buttons and to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.790
 select start and home button think with 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.500
 select buttons start everything is clear but 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.900
 with the home button we need 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.970
 understand it is needed for inclusion and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.459
 pairing device via bluetooth 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.470
 the process of stress is extremely simple and not 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.540
 requires the installation of additional software 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.780
 the phone must simultaneously hold 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.349
 same home button and x or 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.120
 cross 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.680
 then you need to wait until red 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.340
 the light bulb on the gamepad will not start quickly 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.709
 blink 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.290
 after which the controller will be ready for 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.599
 banning word for charging controllers 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.890
 use conventional microusb connector and 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.630
 so no problem finding 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.280
 some kind of special charging cable 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.599
 you will not have 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.079
 Here we actually come to the very 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.430
 main game example asphalt 8 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.560
 accurately identified the controller than 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.569
 immediately informed and fine 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.760
 worked subsequently with popular 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.280
 shooter d-trigger 2 situation a bit 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.959
 another game was not originally defined 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.579
 connected gamepad for normal 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.859
 work we had to assign buttons 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.930
 manually in the game settings menu, but with 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.780
 real racing 3 without the use of special equipment 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.150
 the controller refused to work flatly 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.950
 and since we are talking about special means who is here 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.230
 need to say that in the play market and 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.989
 software that can make work 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.239
 gamepad with any game called such 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.190
 soft kim list of supported 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.470
 games it includes almost all 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.630
 last hail gameplay rest 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.579
 major game developers are also required 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.290
 catch up soon in this 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.209
 there is no doubt that the market 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.609
 this year's mobile controllers will be 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.380
 only evolve now many 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.019
 major players such as for example 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.400
 samsung or loggatec presented 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.959
 own development 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.329
 I think developers are unlikely to 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.970
 ignore this facts and us soon 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:54.609
 time is waiting for the dominance of adapted games 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.609
 under various gamepads on this cider
