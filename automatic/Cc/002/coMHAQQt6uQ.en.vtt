going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.440> talk<00:00:04.589> about<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> divide

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
going to talk about how to divide

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.290 
going to talk about how to divide
iris<00:00:06.299> bulbs<00:00:06.779> now<00:00:07.620> irises<00:00:08.309> multiply<00:00:08.910> really

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
iris bulbs now irises multiply really

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.570 
iris bulbs now irises multiply really
quickly<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.019> they<00:00:10.590> really<00:00:10.860> like<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.280> things

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
quickly and they really like two things

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.089 
quickly and they really like two things
that<00:00:11.820> Sun<00:00:12.150> good<00:00:12.750> drainage<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.559> lots<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.920> room

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
that Sun good drainage and lots of room

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.220 
that Sun good drainage and lots of room
to<00:00:14.250> grow<00:00:14.370> they<00:00:15.330> don't<00:00:15.540> really<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> shade

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
to grow they don't really like the shade

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.170 
to grow they don't really like the shade
so<00:00:16.590> I'm<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> divide<00:00:17.400> them<00:00:17.550> back<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
so I'm going to divide them back out and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
so I'm going to divide them back out and
move<00:00:18.300> them<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.449> another<00:00:18.840> spot<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.980> use<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
move them to another spot I can use a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
move them to another spot I can use a
shovel<00:00:20.430> or<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.330> pitchfork<00:00:21.630> either

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
shovel or I can use a pitchfork either

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.730 
shovel or I can use a pitchfork either
way<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:23.550> easy<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.740> first

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
way and it's really easy to do so first

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.740 
way and it's really easy to do so first
of<00:00:25.890> all<00:00:26.010> when<00:00:26.220> I'm<00:00:26.340> dividing<00:00:26.939> them<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.539> have

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
of all when I'm dividing them out I have

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.800 
of all when I'm dividing them out I have
found<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.230> easier<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> cut<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.310> greens

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
found it's easier to cut the greens

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.749 
found it's easier to cut the greens
before<00:00:30.810> then<00:00:31.410> after<00:00:31.949> because<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.520> makes

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
before then after because it just makes

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.910 
before then after because it just makes
a<00:00:32.910> mess<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.420> then<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> divide

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
a mess and then that way when you divide

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
a mess and then that way when you divide
them<00:00:35.100> they're<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.030> cleaned<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> ready<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
them they're all cleaned up and ready to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.290 
them they're all cleaned up and ready to
go<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.399> cut<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.059> greens

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
go so what I do is just cut the greens

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.709 
go so what I do is just cut the greens
down<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:41.010> are<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.700> still<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.540> see

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
down so that they are I still can see

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.299 
down so that they are I still can see
where<00:00:42.899> they're<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.800> clean<00:00:44.010> them<00:00:44.129> up

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
where they're at but just clean them up

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.250 
where they're at but just clean them up
a<00:00:44.430> little<00:00:44.520> bit<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.539> clean<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
a little bit and we clean some of the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770 
a little bit and we clean some of the
weeds<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.640> area<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.360> bit<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
weeds from the area a little bit so you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.400 
weeds from the area a little bit so you
know<00:00:48.930> where<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> bulbs<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> when

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
know where the bulbs are at and when

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.920 
know where the bulbs are at and when
you're<00:00:52.559> dividing<00:00:53.039> them<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.730> rule<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.449> thumb<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you're dividing them to rule of thumb is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.799 
you're dividing them to rule of thumb is
go<00:00:55.199> from<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> outside<00:00:56.000> into<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> inside<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
go from the outside into the inside and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.630 
go from the outside into the inside and
if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.640> crowded

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
if you have a really really crowded

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.599 
if you have a really really crowded
clump<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:01.020> start<00:01:01.260> hacking<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.399> just

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
clump you just start hacking and I just

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
clump you just start hacking and I just
hack<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.600> hard<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.739> divide

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
hack as hard as you can and just divide

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.539 
hack as hard as you can and just divide
them<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> work<00:01:08.340> your

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
them back out so just kind of work your

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
them back out so just kind of work your
way<00:01:08.580> around<00:01:08.939> -<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.960> lot<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> times<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.560> go

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
way around - a lot of times I don't go

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
way around - a lot of times I don't go
right<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> plant<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.780> you've<00:01:12.930> got

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
right into the plant but when you've got

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
right into the plant but when you've got
just<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.470> mound<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.340> can't<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.790> them

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just a mound and you can't get them

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.850 
just a mound and you can't get them
separated<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:16.020> whack<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
separated to just whack right into the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.859 
separated to just whack right into the
middle<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:18.119> easy<00:01:18.270> rule<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.720> them

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
middle of it so an easy rule with them

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.010 
middle of it so an easy rule with them
too<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.350> keep<00:01:20.000> breaking<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
too is just keep breaking it up you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
too is just keep breaking it up you
don't<00:01:22.170> pull<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.770> until<00:01:23.130> you've<00:01:23.280> broken

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
don't pull them out until you've broken

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
don't pull them out until you've broken
up<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> ground<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.750> well<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.950> work

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
up the ground really well so just work

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.850 
up the ground really well so just work
the<00:01:26.430> whole<00:01:26.700> area<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.479> well<00:01:27.810> before<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the whole area really well before you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
the whole area really well before you
even<00:01:29.040> start<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> try<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> divide<00:01:30.810> them<00:01:30.990> out

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
even start and try to divide them out

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.840 
even start and try to divide them out
break<00:01:31.470> them<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.829> between<00:01:31.979> wherever<00:01:32.700> they're

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
break them in between wherever they're

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.310 
break them in between wherever they're
coming<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.509> it'll<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.020> lot<00:01:34.290> less

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
coming up because it'll make a lot less

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.289 
coming up because it'll make a lot less
work<00:01:34.740> later

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
work later

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.770 
work later
so<00:01:36.299> once<00:01:36.509> you've<00:01:36.720> worked<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:38.780> then

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so once you've worked it all up then

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.630 
so once you've worked it all up then
it's<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.200> easy<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.920> bulbs<00:01:41.250> will<00:01:41.400> come

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it's really easy the bulbs will come

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.330 
it's really easy the bulbs will come
right<00:01:41.970> out<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:43.350> lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> times<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.040> pull

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
right out and a lot of times to pull

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
right out and a lot of times to pull
from<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> bottom<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.320> every<00:01:46.320> little

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
from the bottom because every little

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.859 
from the bottom because every little
piece<00:01:46.799> will<00:01:47.009> turn<00:01:47.220> around<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> grow<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:49.079> so

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.990 

and<00:01:56.350> once<00:01:56.590> you've<00:01:56.770> divided<00:01:57.189> them<00:01:57.490> back<00:01:57.700> out

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
and once you've divided them back out

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.179 
and once you've divided them back out
you'll<00:01:58.689> find<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.320> you'll<00:01:59.500> have<00:01:59.649> all<00:01:59.920> types

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
you'll find that you'll have all types

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.669 
you'll find that you'll have all types
of<00:02:00.369> babies<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.000> every<00:02:01.960> little<00:02:02.229> piece<00:02:02.439> will

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
of babies and every little piece will

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.099 
of babies and every little piece will
grow<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.789> easiest<00:02:04.179> way<00:02:04.329> to<00:02:04.450> separate<00:02:04.990> them

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
grow so the easiest way to separate them

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.840 
grow so the easiest way to separate them
is<00:02:05.259> just<00:02:05.289> to<00:02:05.619> twist<00:02:05.920> them<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.340> just<00:02:06.490> twist

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
is just to twist them you just twist

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.999 
is just to twist them you just twist
them<00:02:07.000> apart<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.659> then<00:02:08.349> I'll<00:02:08.470> have<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.649> lot<00:02:08.890> of

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
them apart so then I'll have a lot of

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.410 
them apart so then I'll have a lot of
starts<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.550> I'm<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.849> turn<00:02:10.000> around<00:02:10.090> and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
starts and I'm going to turn around and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.270 
starts and I'm going to turn around and
plant<00:02:10.539> these<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:11.080> sunnier<00:02:11.410> area<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.160> they'll

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
plant these in a sunnier area so they'll

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.390 
plant these in a sunnier area so they'll
do<00:02:12.430> much<00:02:12.610> better<00:02:12.910> next<00:02:13.209> year
