00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
bit of print in there doesn't really

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.539 
bit of print in there doesn't really
work<00:01:43.470> suppose<00:01:44.470> that<00:01:44.710> with<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> thumb

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
work suppose that with the thumb

work suppose that with the thumb
movement<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.119> works<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.479> bit<00:01:46.509> be<00:01:46.750> kind<00:01:46.930> of<00:01:47.020> get

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
movement it works a bit be kind of get

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.280 
movement it works a bit be kind of get
better<00:01:47.350> gather<00:01:47.619> there<00:01:47.950> anyway<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:49.170> I'd<00:01:50.170> be

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
better gather there anyway so I'd be

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.690 
better gather there anyway so I'd be
sure<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.560> benefit<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:50.950> accompanies<00:01:51.490> in

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
sure the benefit that accompanies in

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.800 
sure the benefit that accompanies in
pros<00:01:52.229> having<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.409> on<00:01:53.560> their<00:01:53.770> gloves<00:01:54.810> tickly

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
pros having that on their gloves tickly

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.440 
pros having that on their gloves tickly
tailored<00:01:56.560> fit<00:01:56.770> it's<00:01:56.979> not<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.189> y<00:01:57.490> fitting<00:01:58.000> love<00:01:58.210> I

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
tailored fit it's not a y fitting love I

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.990 
tailored fit it's not a y fitting love I
found<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.049> takedown<00:01:59.320> version<00:02:00.040> this<00:02:00.790> is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
found that the takedown version this is

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.719 
found that the takedown version this is
the<00:02:01.180> power<00:02:01.420> one<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.500> power<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.280> really

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
the power one the power to is really

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.120 
the power one the power to is really
white<00:02:03.909> or<00:02:04.659> fight<00:02:04.990> fair<00:02:05.290> bit<00:02:05.500> wider<00:02:05.710> than<00:02:05.979> this

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
white or fight fair bit wider than this

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.819 
white or fight fair bit wider than this
anyway<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.729> feels<00:02:07.000> really<00:02:07.240> tailored

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
anyway but this feels really tailored

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.550 
anyway but this feels really tailored
slightly<00:02:08.829> long<00:02:09.220> strap<00:02:09.670> on<00:02:09.939> on<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.869> on<00:02:11.409> the

right hands left hands not so long this
just<00:02:15.519> might<00:02:15.700> be<00:02:15.849> just<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.389> one<00:02:16.629> pair<00:02:16.870> but

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
just might be just this one pair but

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.630 
just might be just this one pair but
there's<00:02:17.559> a<00:02:17.620> nice<00:02:17.739> routing<00:02:18.099> there<00:02:18.219> for

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
there's a nice routing there for

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.300 
there's a nice routing there for
personalization<00:02:19.630> as<00:02:19.750> well<00:02:19.930> thumb<00:02:20.770> protection

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
personalization as well thumb protection

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.040 
personalization as well thumb protection
in<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.460> glove<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:21.790> well<00:02:21.940> as<00:02:22.090> whether<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:22.990> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
in the glove as well as whether it's a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.020 
in the glove as well as whether it's a
finger<00:02:23.230> protection<00:02:23.680> going<00:02:24.490> take<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> look<00:02:24.940> at

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
finger protection going take a look at

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.870 
finger protection going take a look at
the<00:02:25.120> spine<00:02:25.740> also<00:02:26.740> comes<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:29.290> this

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
the spine also comes with with this

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.120 
the spine also comes with with this
strapping<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.450> I've<00:02:31.600> put<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.920> left

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
strapping that I've put on on the left

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.410 
strapping that I've put on on the left
hand<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.460> to<00:02:33.610> see<00:02:33.850> how<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.060> worked

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
hand just to see how it worked

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.120 
hand just to see how it worked
it's<00:02:34.780> basically<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.350> right<00:02:35.680> they<00:02:35.800> call<00:02:35.980> it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it's basically a right they call it

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.130 
it's basically a right they call it
right<00:02:36.370> back<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.360> only<00:02:37.510> comes<00:02:37.810> with<00:02:38.020> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
right back it only comes with the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
give the rest a bit more support I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.020 
give the rest a bit more support I
personally<00:02:47.320> wouldn't<00:02:47.590> wouldn't<00:02:48.310> wear<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.610> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
personally wouldn't wouldn't wear it I

didn't<00:02:49.450> feel<00:02:49.660> particularly<00:02:50.230> comfortable<00:02:50.380> not

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
didn't feel particularly comfortable not

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.440 
didn't feel particularly comfortable not
really<00:02:51.420> sure<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:54.459> benefit<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.300> see

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
really sure the benefit of that to see

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.610 
really sure the benefit of that to see
on<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.750> suppose<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.080> gives<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.410> bit<00:02:56.590> of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
on this I suppose it gives you a bit of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.820 
on this I suppose it gives you a bit of
extra<00:02:56.950> support<00:02:57.310> my<00:02:58.120> bit<00:02:58.270> more<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.690> tight<00:02:59.530> man

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
extra support my bit more of a tight man

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.470 
extra support my bit more of a tight man
really<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.400> be<00:03:00.489> honest<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.820> would<00:03:00.940> use<00:03:01.180> tight

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
really to be honest I would use tight

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.600 
really to be honest I would use tight
there's<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> kind<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.500> comes<00:03:02.650> loose<00:03:02.890> there<00:03:03.130> I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
there's a kind of comes loose there I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.750 
there's a kind of comes loose there I
would<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:05.020> wouldn't<00:03:05.770> use<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.280> be<00:03:06.400> honest

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
would I wouldn't use that to be honest

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.840 
would I wouldn't use that to be honest
with<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.520> want<00:03:09.640> to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
with you but is there if you want to

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.229 
with you but is there if you want to
give<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.239> go<00:03:10.450> take<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> look<00:03:11.470> at<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.709> spines

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
give it a go take a look at the spines

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.060 
give it a go take a look at the spines
improve<00:03:13.239> your<00:03:13.360> spine<00:03:13.600> which<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.320> needed<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.980> be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
improve your spine which it needed to be

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.520 
improve your spine which it needed to be
improved<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.550> be<00:03:15.700> honest<00:03:15.910> because<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:17.290> last

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
improved to be honest because the last

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.360 
improved to be honest because the last
point<00:03:17.920> on<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:19.090> wasn't<00:03:19.570> fantastic<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:21.250> if

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
point on it wasn't fantastic but if

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.940 
point on it wasn't fantastic but if
they've<00:03:21.580> definitely<00:03:21.760> improved<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:23.830> a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
they've definitely improved it it's a

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.670 
they've definitely improved it it's a
new<00:03:24.160> flextech<00:03:24.880> spine<00:03:25.209> but<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.110> does<00:03:26.290> work<00:03:26.560> that

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
new flextech spine but it does work that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.860 
new flextech spine but it does work that
makes<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.400> much<00:03:27.580> better<00:03:27.880> now<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.600> kind<00:03:28.780> of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
makes that much better now so it kind of

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.310 
makes that much better now so it kind of
it<00:03:29.440> fits<00:03:29.799> with<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.310> with<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.299> finger<00:03:31.720> get

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
it fits with the with the finger get

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.530 
it fits with the with the finger get
closer<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.739> try<00:03:33.010> get<00:03:33.190> your<00:03:33.310> view<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.450> you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
closer to try get your view of it so you

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.710 
closer to try get your view of it so you
can<00:03:34.570> see<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.019> slightly<00:03:35.880> slightly<00:03:36.880> better<00:03:37.570> than

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
can see it slightly slightly better than

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.720 
can see it slightly slightly better than
it<00:03:37.930> was<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.350> doesn't<00:03:38.650> kind<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.860> if<00:03:39.519> it's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it was and it doesn't kind of if it's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.789 
it was and it doesn't kind of if it's
quite<00:03:39.940> easy<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.209> break<00:03:40.420> before<00:03:40.630> which<00:03:41.620> was

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
quite easy to break before which was

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:42.960 
quite easy to break before which was
always<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.040> bit<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> concern<00:03:42.610> there<00:03:42.760> quite

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
always a bit of a concern there quite
