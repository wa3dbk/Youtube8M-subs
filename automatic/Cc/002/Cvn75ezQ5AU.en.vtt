think<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.980> feature<00:00:08.160> doesn't<00:00:08.490> exist<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.630> does

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
think the feature doesn't exist it does

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.259 
think the feature doesn't exist it does
exist<00:00:10.230> if<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.530> know<00:00:10.650> where<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.830> find<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.280> I'm

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
exist if you know where to find it I'm

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.650 
exist if you know where to find it I'm
going<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> drop<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> video<00:00:13.230> here<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.660> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
going to drop in the video here and the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.290 
going to drop in the video here and the
way<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
way to do it is that you just have the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.290 
way to do it is that you just have the
video<00:00:18.420> selected<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> edit<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> speed<00:00:21.060> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
video selected go to edit and speed is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
video selected go to edit and speed is
right<00:00:21.600> here<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.830> half<00:00:23.039> speed

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
right here if I want to do half speed

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.050 
right here if I want to do half speed
its<00:00:23.580> point<00:00:23.970> 5<00:00:24.180> X<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.650> plays<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.400> half

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
its point 5 X and it plays it at half

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.529 
its point 5 X and it plays it at half
speed<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.859> can<00:00:28.859> even<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.279> quarter<00:00:30.119> speed<00:00:30.330> at

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
speed or I can even do quarter speed at

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.060 
speed or I can even do quarter speed at
point<00:00:30.810> 2<00:00:30.929> 5<00:00:31.109> X<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.630> also<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:34.050> faster<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
point 2 5 X you can also go faster up to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.869 
point 2 5 X you can also go faster up to
64<00:00:35.700> times<00:00:36.059> speed<00:00:36.480> which<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.460> way<00:00:38.460> too<00:00:38.520> fast

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
64 times speed which is way too fast

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.819 
64 times speed which is way too fast
what's<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> short<00:00:39.870> clip<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.379> can't<00:00:40.620> see

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
what's the short clip really can't see

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.200 
what's the short clip really can't see
it<00:00:41.809> four<00:00:42.809> times<00:00:42.930> speed<00:00:43.230> however<00:00:44.840> there<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.960> go

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
it four times speed however there we go

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.510 
it four times speed however there we go
the<00:00:48.210> only<00:00:48.420> drawback<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.440> using<00:00:49.829> Windows<00:00:50.399> Live

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.260 
mode like this so I just right click go
to<00:02:09.929> video<00:02:10.170> effects<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.940> want<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.209> do

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
to video effects and if I want to do

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.640 
to video effects and if I want to do
half<00:02:12.480> speed

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
half speed

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.869 
half speed
I<00:02:13.739> choose<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> effects<00:02:14.970> slow<00:02:15.209> down<00:02:15.480> half<00:02:16.019> and

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
I choose the effects slow down half and

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.660 
I choose the effects slow down half and
then<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.150> slows<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.450> down<00:02:18.599> by<00:02:18.930> half<00:02:19.670> this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
then it slows it down by half this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.130 
then it slows it down by half this
feature<00:02:20.909> is<00:02:21.000> requested<00:02:21.659> a<00:02:21.720> lot<00:02:21.900> because

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
feature is requested a lot because

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.229 
feature is requested a lot because
evidently<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:22.980> lot<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.280> people<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:23.730> slowing

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
evidently a lot of people think slowing

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.179 
evidently a lot of people think slowing
things<00:02:24.450> down<00:02:24.689> or<00:02:25.079> speeding<00:02:25.439> things<00:02:25.769> up<00:02:26.010> is

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
things down or speeding things up is

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.149 
things down or speeding things up is
really<00:02:26.640> funny<00:02:27.349> well<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.620> don't<00:02:28.739> know<00:02:29.040> about

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
really funny well I don't know about

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.690 
really funny well I don't know about
that<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:30.109> that's<00:02:31.109> how<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.379> do<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:31.799> if

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
