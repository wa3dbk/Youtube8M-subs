but honestly I think the competition in
top<00:00:39.780> lane<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.110> our<00:00:40.260> group<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.310> as<00:00:41.850> strong

top lane in our group it's not as strong

top lane in our group it's not as strong
as<00:00:42.390> people<00:00:42.660> might<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.520> it<00:00:44.520> allowed<00:00:44.760> me

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
as people might think so it allowed me

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
strange like they pop on your base we

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.910 
strange like they pop on your base we
see<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.020> kind<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.260> strange<00:02:21.440> teleport

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
yeah first off what was going through

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.130 
yeah first off what was going through
your<00:02:25.670> mind<00:02:25.850> when<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.120> saw<00:02:26.270> all<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.630> unfold

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
your mind when you saw all that unfold

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.949 
your mind when you saw all that unfold
in<00:02:27.410> your<00:02:27.530> base<00:02:28.240> when<00:02:29.240> they<00:02:29.360> rushed<00:02:29.600> out<00:02:29.750> base

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
in your base when they rushed out base

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.140 
in your base when they rushed out base
we<00:02:30.200> knew<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.650> had<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.830> fight<00:02:31.130> them<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:31.970> weren't

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
we knew we had to fight them we weren't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.190 
we knew we had to fight them we weren't
even<00:02:32.209> sure<00:02:32.390> if<00:02:32.570> we<00:02:32.660> were<00:02:32.750> going<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.930> win<00:02:33.020> or<00:02:33.170> not

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
even sure if we were going to win or not

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.990 
even sure if we were going to win or not
because<00:02:33.440> they<00:02:33.770> crushed<00:02:34.070> us<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.580> fights

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
because they crushed us in the fights

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.630 
because they crushed us in the fights
before<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.540> but<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.709> think<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.280> move

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
before it but like I think that move

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.300 
before it but like I think that move
summed<00:02:38.000> up<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.300> whole<00:02:38.450> game<00:02:38.720> because<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.160> was

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
summed up the whole game because it was

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.580 
summed up the whole game because it was
a<00:02:40.340> complete<00:02:40.730> mess<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.209> my<00:02:41.240> eyes<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.410> think

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
a complete mess in my eyes like I think

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.380 
a complete mess in my eyes like I think
both<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.770> us<00:02:42.980> made<00:02:43.190> me<00:02:43.550> really<00:02:43.790> bad<00:02:43.940> mistakes

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
both of us made me really bad mistakes

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.150 
both of us made me really bad mistakes
we<00:02:45.200> had<00:02:45.320> such<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> big<00:02:46.250> lead<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.640> felt<00:02:46.970> like<00:02:47.300> and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
we had such a big lead I felt like and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.670 
we had such a big lead I felt like and
we<00:02:49.160> did<00:02:49.280> nothing<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.500> think<00:02:51.500> that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
we did nothing with it so I think that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.470 
we did nothing with it so I think that
move<00:02:52.010> there<00:02:52.310> by<00:02:52.489> them<00:02:52.670> summed<00:02:53.000> up<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.239> entire

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
move there by them summed up the entire

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.500 
move there by them summed up the entire
game<00:02:53.780> but<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.800> like<00:02:55.459> after<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:56.030> had<00:02:56.330> beat

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
game but and like after you had beat

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.420 
game but and like after you had beat
them<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.840> somewhere<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.500> immediately<00:02:58.220> were

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
them a somewhere you immediately were

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.740 
them a somewhere you immediately were
that<00:02:58.640> you'd<00:02:58.730> won<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.000> game<00:02:59.180> or<00:02:59.360> what<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.660> know

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
that you'd won the game or what you know

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.170 
that you'd won the game or what you know
what<00:02:59.900> was<00:02:59.989> happening<00:03:00.080> in<00:03:00.410> comms<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:01.910> had<00:03:02.030> no

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
what was happening in comms we had no

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.150 
what was happening in comms we had no
idea<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:02.570> we<00:03:02.660> had<00:03:02.780> time<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.140> finish<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> or<00:03:03.800> not

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
idea if we had time to finish it or not

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.130 
idea if we had time to finish it or not
so<00:03:04.400> you're<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:04.790> let's<00:03:04.970> take<00:03:05.390> in<00:03:05.540> him<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.870> go

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
so you're like let's take in him and go

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.500 
so you're like let's take in him and go
to<00:03:06.200> Nash<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:07.640> when<00:03:07.820> we<00:03:07.910> actually<00:03:08.090> killed<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
to Nash but when we actually killed the

processes<00:03:45.110> right<00:03:45.290> now<00:03:45.440> well<00:03:46.190> first<00:03:47.180> thing<00:03:47.360> is

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
processes right now well first thing is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.330 
processes right now well first thing is
we<00:03:47.510> really<00:03:47.989> disappointed<00:03:48.650> about<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:49.040> because

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
we really disappointed about it because

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.410 
we really disappointed about it because
we<00:03:49.459> know<00:03:49.489> this<00:03:49.730> whole<00:03:49.880> thing<00:03:50.120> could<00:03:50.150> have<00:03:50.329> gone

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
we know this whole thing could have gone

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.949 
we know this whole thing could have gone
better<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.900> when<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:51.980> happened<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.730> was<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.720> big

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
better and when it happened it was a big

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.949 
better and when it happened it was a big
mindset<00:03:54.530> hit<00:03:54.739> for<00:03:55.040> us<00:03:55.070> more<00:03:55.489> than<00:03:55.610> anything

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
mindset hit for us more than anything

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.259 
mindset hit for us more than anything
because<00:03:56.959> Julius<00:03:57.560> played<00:03:57.769> well<00:03:57.980> but<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.610> think

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
because Julius played well but I think

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.789 
because Julius played well but I think
the<00:03:59.570> rest<00:03:59.780> of<00:03:59.930> us<00:04:00.049> didn't<00:04:00.320> really<00:04:00.530> step<00:04:00.769> up

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
the rest of us didn't really step up

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.110 
the rest of us didn't really step up
like<00:04:01.160> we<00:04:01.250> didn't<00:04:01.459> want<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.700> play<00:04:01.790> as<00:04:01.970> much

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
like we didn't want to play as much

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.220 
like we didn't want to play as much
anymore<00:04:02.860> but<00:04:04.390> yeah<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.570> whole<00:04:05.690> thing<00:04:05.959> is<00:04:06.079> just

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
anymore but yeah the whole thing is just

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.620 
anymore but yeah the whole thing is just
really<00:04:06.680> disappointing<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.910> for<00:04:08.269> you<00:04:08.360> guys<00:04:08.510> I
