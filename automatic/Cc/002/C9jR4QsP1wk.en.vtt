00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.889
 hello dear colleagues the development 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.380
 continues 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.390
 you already know my other videos 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.230
 where we steam with a combat knife 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.410
 Heated knife the honeycombs 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.750
 discover 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 By the way, there are many others 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.070
 methods holy gave to the meeting many 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.850
 do it with a queue with one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.650
 wavy knife that's me 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.010
 got the idea of a machine 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.559
 to develop further and with one 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.589
 wave cut knife where i do not have it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.149
 has to hold better and the honeycomb but 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.859
 I have the human knife 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.469
 in principle firmly mounted and leave that 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.589
 work knife where I show you the same 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.359
 once again 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:58.289
 then I have my well-known timber construction 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.059
 set so rebuilt that's why 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.269
 can move and heat 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.620
 electronically with a 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:09.510
 temperature control the next 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.850
 generation is then this machine 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.510
 I think I have everything now 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.150
 installed what you can imagine 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:24.750
 To cover the honeycombs totally super 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.670
 good quick to efficiently discover the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.460
 grow wax of developmental 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.830
 falls into the tub is with a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.660
 win it separately so it can drip off 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.480
 then after completion of the work 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.720
 it can be rolled up with this 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.030
 win and so easily from the tub 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.120
 be removed and the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.800
 further processing to be supplied to 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.870
 Now I'll show you this one 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.750
 machine 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.890
 it consists of a frame holder 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.890
 heated knife electronic 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.729
 Temperature control and just one 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 foot pedal where I run the machine 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.250
 can let 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.250
 look at the knife 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.510
 so i do not need the knife anymore 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.530
 President then attend 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.530
 vice versa 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.640
 discover case underneath then I turn 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.530
 the frame so these cells are on 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.990
 the side slightly upwards and 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.270
 it spilling out honey 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.840
 I was right on field 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.210
 then the girl comes in that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.400
 Loud until you throw up again 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.350
 has four and can further increase 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.920
 on the other side I have one more 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.210
 Manual capping stick a bracket 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.510
 for the development forks here where you can 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.450
 The developed wax also deny it 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.480
 Can in the tub and then you can 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.460
 have the chicken again in the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.010
 lagerstÃ¤tten 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.940
 I think this machine is everything 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:12.880
 installed what you can imagine 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.810
 If you are interested, everything else will tell you 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.140
 is going to get 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.050
 So there is this machine and after 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.970
 like this wood for the b2 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.800
 caspar 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.250
 thanks for watching until next 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.250
 times
