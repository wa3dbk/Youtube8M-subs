however<00:01:37.820> there's<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.150> flipside<00:01:38.510> when<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.320> boil

are<00:01:46.400> boiled<00:01:46.700> away<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.780> if<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.439> want<00:01:48.680> more<00:01:48.920> hop

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
are boiled away so if you want more hop

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.730 
are boiled away so if you want more hop
flavor<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.790> aroma<00:01:50.090> in<00:01:50.299> your<00:01:50.450> beer<00:01:50.810> add<00:01:50.990> more

flavor and aroma in your beer add more

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.580 
flavor and aroma in your beer add more
