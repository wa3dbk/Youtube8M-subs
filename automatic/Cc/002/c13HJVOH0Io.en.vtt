 the red then the green barrel 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.479
 then a targeted shot on the yellow 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.530
 and finally to the purple

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.380
 Laying of difficulty by playing 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.420

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.520
 anointing jones - with one area we 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.330
 just as dramatic and heartbreaking 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.330
 can denote 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.299
 come to an easter egg classic 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.040
 if you in doom 2 the room of the last 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.840
 end opponent enters with 1 hard 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.840
 understandable popular choice played 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.160
 so I can only in what place in there 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.570
 to interpret to understand it 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.140
 you have to move the file backwards 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.120
 play 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:16.890
 then that was not so developer John 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.690
 So romero is behind the hat 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.860
 Actually behind the boss there is 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.230
 a hidden room with the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.430
 aufgeschmissen head of rosemary somehow 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.290
 mag a beauty world at war played again 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.640
 in the second world war on the modern 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.320
 warfare a year before that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.360
 traditional shooter setting behind 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.640
 The well-known series has relaxed 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.350
 weapons from the 30s and 40s 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.180
 on the developer of treyarch 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.100
 a bit too boring that's why she's in 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.000
 level in resistance a bonus weapon 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.620
 have hidden 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.020
 For that you have to cross the river here 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.700
 and from right to left in every puddle 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.320
 jump that you see looks in the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.239
 last tip just towards the web 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.340
 Albums and a few states should be 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.590
 rise in the ears of the structure 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.450
 you find a particularly strong one directly 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.959
 weapon that does not fit the scenario 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.430
 but neatly clean skin chapter 4 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.380

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.480
 developer studio team ninja a little 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.130
 piece of game history hiding in the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.120
 the museum you have to do with rio 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.860
 test rooms go 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.900
 there you see a wall of planks, the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.940

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.250

 the part for you new life again 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.510
 It also represents an early prototype of the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.549
 first xbox console there so should the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.230
 Original xbox really look like 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.850
 kinda cool or even the game cube 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.860
 play spirit almost in today 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.870
 oblivion come here it goes a 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.340
 couple of cool playful approaches and one 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.260
 very cool easter egg has also 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.090
 still hidden in the spirit you have to 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.010
 Now go to this locker room 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.750
 one of the cabins behaves the identity 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.120
 one of the women who appears here 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.799
 has moved properly from the samus aran 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.160
 Metroid has games in this plays 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.080
 filed her helmet 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.340
 in super smash brothers with how can you 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.980
 as you know, many trophies 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.020
 unlock figures of gellendorf 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.120
 link or pikachu a few of these 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.430
 Trophies contain little secrets about 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.270
 the figure of metal mario look 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.800
 exactly 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.690
 then you can see a reflection of the 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.970
 metal marius the smash brothers 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.620
 stage of yoshi even better is the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.790
 Reflection in the MÃ©tro Trophy 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.650
 there can be namely the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.010
 home screen of the snes classic super 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.380
 Everyone can see macho on the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.090
 Gameboy Extreme is also what we call 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.920
 and yet we were able to enjoy the seaside 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.000
 not even though it's right under ours 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.830
 nose was hidden 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.450
 if you go out in Cologne's handheld 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.030
 Just press the pause button and 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.830
 then wait about 20 seconds put down small 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.840
 Everything clean a dance on the parquet 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.700
 unfortunately without music because of the break 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.410
 cannabis demand screen was silent 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.410
 but we can change that here 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.270
 so that's it the gigaset on ours 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.340
 Of course there's the new one on the page 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.469
 There is hardly anything to halo about 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.240
