 hello in galletero I'm screaming and today I'm going to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.170
 show a little more closely to the new 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.170
 ipad mini 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.779
 this new apple device 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.300
 introduces the format of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.179
 the 79 inches a size that although 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.050
 It seemed not to convince the people of Cupertino 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.619
 finally it has arrived at the catalog 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.619
 manzanero 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.740
 how do you see your design is quite 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.870
 thin and light weight with edges 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.360
 rounded in which of course not 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.360
 I could miss the new lightning connector 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.730
 likewise the power buttons and 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.949
 blocking or volume control 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.530
 they are also present in a housing 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.019
 soft touch available the same two 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 colors offered by the black iphone5 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.640
 graphite and white silver 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.659
 The touch panel of this ipad mini account

 with a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.369
 yielding a density of 163 points per 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.890
 inch and without offering retina technology 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.970
 display something that has undoubtedly caused 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 the occasional complaint 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.360
 how will you be checking your interface is 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.790
 of leftovers known and is that the ipad mini 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.660
 has not changed a bit of the environment 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.660

 our fingers in the areas near the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.870
 edge of the screen so that we 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.970
 result an impediment to the hour by 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.930
 example of reading a book or browsing 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.930
 for a web page 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849

 the games are undoubtedly an interesting 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.780
 incentive to consider this 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.790
 79 inch mini 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.830
 given its good size and interesting 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.220
 offer of securities available today 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.220
 in day 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.890
 the ipad mini also has a webcam 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.560
 facetime with 5 megapixel camera 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.560

 ah 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.490
 the ipad mini therefore assumes that 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.530
 medium term for those who love 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.870
 ios to which the iphone is left 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.299
 small for multimedia enjoyment and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.950
 ipad of 9 with 7 inches will turn out 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.950
 something bulky to transport

 the ipad mini thus becomes a 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.660

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.580

 the games among others 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.890
 taking the best of it so far 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.840
 seen on apple mobile computers to 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.720
 a proposal that although it is not the most 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.210
 powerful or have the best screen 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.920
 Get convinced by its portability 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.230
 design and by an operating system of 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.920
 excellent response and with great hook in 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.920

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.240
 the question we ask ourselves is not because 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.970
 what apple has now removed this substitute 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.700
 7 inches but quite the opposite 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.700
 because he did not decide to do it before
