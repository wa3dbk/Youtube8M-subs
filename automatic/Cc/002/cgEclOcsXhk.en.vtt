00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.520
 heartfelt greetings to you black rose 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.090
 we are in the air again and now we are 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.730
 saw another surprise but the Germans 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.040
 here is such a drin drin and ice and we 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.950
 We looked that we can more precisely that we do not 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.500
 we can even know and see now 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.420
 I wonder what hit dostno 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.260
 high-explosive shells urgently explosive 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.300
 incendiary in the lower plane 18 well and 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.520
 he flies as if from crazy 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.830
 slightly they say that it hit me who me 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 spat and flies itself further in general 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.800
 of course it's wonderful i obviously 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.510
 I did not expect this from this weapon although knowing 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.880
 stores could guess that in 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.330
 In general, we have planted another pig 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.780
 oh well we look further well 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.530
 would hit again again 18 flies in 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.600
 i don't know okay you can be more 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.300
 do not tune the plane although the guns say 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.150
 it was brutal there steam hit 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.030
 translated 18 but in the theory of daryl and and all 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.760
 still did not experience the fact that before 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.910
 this did not reach the maximum that allowed 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.420
 and allowed to do this attack 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.480
 ground target 32 by 32 meters from a distance 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.670
 one and a half kilometer of 1200 meters and so on 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.010
 shells went to bed boring there ballistics 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.470
 Well was good for our game, I really 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.600
 I do not know whether to try to spend 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.730
 here is a parallel and I would really like 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.560
 get something more why something 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.570
 more well because the plane i 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.420
 deflated you know that this car she 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.550
 let's say so to put it mildly will not be with 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.900
 she herself will not take part on 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.400
 equal in battles and the 262 itself is beautiful 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.040
 everyone knows that he is not the best 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.590
 fighter is not the best fighter down 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.580
 fan for the most part so here this 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.530
 car she lights all we saw 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.890
 32 shells in ammunition 50 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.250
 millimeter cannon 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.750
 In general, it is clear that we are destroying 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.630
 large targets medium and heavy 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.330
 bombers no more run for 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.420
 fighters don't need you won't achieve 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.350
 success for the fighter you low 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.540
 rate of fire 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.670
 but for here with heavy 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.470
 beaver fighter interceptor quite 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.500
 so itâ€™s okay 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.980
 bother machine fan hit in 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.140
 the battle 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.390
 you know what to do is destroyed mobile 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.870
 which at these levels is mainly from 18 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.930
 composed rare battle features as we saw 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.690
 in the first video, well, and if we have arden 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.940
 we know that there is a flock of b-17 them and 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.760
 for which we will go in principle 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.830
 eat something like this 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.530
 where else can we participate well 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.300
 enough to remember what it used to be 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.550
 such an event if I'm not mistaken she 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.770
 the guardian angel was called there the whole point 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.190
 in fact that on the German airfield 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.220
 must attack bomber at-17 they 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.170
 fly already you appear air they 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.510
 somewhere about twenty kilometers away from you you 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.490
 not moving towards plus 18 such 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.670
 saving the form of mustangs of different 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.560
 modifications and in general here on the background 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.140
 of all this we are fighting there and must 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.330
 destroy enough 18 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.830
 so that their total bomb load is not 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.780
 enough to destroy our German 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.050
 the airfield so there we would 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.550
 really played very well then 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.990
 there is 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.000
 would worship did whale frags 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.670
 got experience money but this is not important 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.080
 generally there sorbitol aircraft as usual 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:00.280
 62 plus here we have this fish so 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.140
 Pinocchio turned out interesting fun and 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.740
 of course for those who hate b-17 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.990
 here is the most to us again, everything is very 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.420
 very modest and conditional therefore not 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.300
 make grand plans that you can 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.920
 fly on an equal footing no 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.440
 it won't be until 18 shoot down the forces 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.200
 Well, really not like I have a video going for 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.850
 beavers in the clouds arrows see poorly and 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.240
 it turns them out there with a minimum 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.510
 distances of 6 hours to make there 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.730
 all the same if it is an event 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.720
 will have a little hard 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.670
 gain height 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.590
 speed attack them on big 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.020
 speed top stitch go away again 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.910
 rooms at that will accompany 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.480
 enemy mustang fighters to you 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.310
 will not be easy so we will not 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.340
 build vain people just 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.310
 imagine what it will be fun this 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.570
 maybe that's the most important thing then 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.830
 the machine will be more or less 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.880
 claimed in all other cases 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.680
 it will be another unnecessary craft well yes 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.140
 Okay, that's it, but what do we see? 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.170
 cut with fighters like i already 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.639
 He said it is not necessary for them to run around in 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.120
 first 10 2 meteors 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:16.009
 Especially if you are papalexy bromine panther 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.039
 to put it mildly we are there no one is calling 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.699
 we just got there right away 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:25.490
 push off the plane is enough for yes 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.009
 okay look running for meteor of course 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.449
 is there speed 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.249
 turns around I wipe my palms I think 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.800
 Well, now I will take him to the log 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:34.849
 I will try to tear it down 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.340
 ballistics all the same it is only the second 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.419
 battle ballistics is not completely clear 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.560
 but he would have been a little more I got well and so 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.990
 useless rate of fire ballistics 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.939
 doing their job and of course all mana 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.180
 again with what possible curve 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:52.159
 Well, somehow so small bull in general 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.860
 all this makes us quite self 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:56.750
 a normal fighter hunter 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.819
 what do you have to move any 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.710
 case guys sit on the strip they need 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:03.080
 at least somehow cover up imitate 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.000
 prevent attack somehow if possible 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.110
 do that of course it needs to be done 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.789
 at least try well and here you see 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.529
 such things are like the night too 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:15.169
 video put like subscribe to the channel 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:17.120
 recommend the video to friends of a clear sky and 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.259
 good mood with you was black rose 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.259
 until new meetings bye
