what's up guys axe got here this is a
bit<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.899> an<00:00:04.110> oddity<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:04.710> me<00:00:05.040> because<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.430> don't

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
bit of an oddity for me because I don't

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.970 
bit of an oddity for me because I don't
typically<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.180> ton<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.600> game<00:00:06.990> unboxings

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
typically do a ton of game unboxings

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.430 
typically do a ton of game unboxings
what<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.670> do<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> fairly<00:00:09.719> professional

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
what I do I have a fairly professional

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
what I do I have a fairly professional
set<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:11.040> my<00:00:11.219> kitchen<00:00:11.429> table<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:12.540> like

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
set up at my kitchen table with like

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.629 
set up at my kitchen table with like
three-point<00:00:13.679> lighting<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.370> stuff

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
three-point lighting and all that stuff

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.070 
three-point lighting and all that stuff
I<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.330> point<00:00:15.540> landing<00:00:15.750> actually

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
I think it's two point landing actually

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.870 
I think it's two point landing actually
and<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.490> point<00:00:17.730> lighting

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and that this is one point lighting

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.460 
and that this is one point lighting
actually<00:00:18.449> well<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.630> guess<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.020> count<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
actually well I guess if you count the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.609 
actually well I guess if you count the
top<00:00:19.800> light<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.580> anyway<00:00:21.289> we're<00:00:22.289> gonna<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.560> in

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
