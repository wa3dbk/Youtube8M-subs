00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
themselves and put them into

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.680 
themselves and put them into
subcategories<00:05:22.920> such<00:05:23.610> as<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:24.060> feel<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.630> just

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690

sound like a broken record here but you
guys<00:06:14.850> just<00:06:15.090> need<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.270> understand<00:06:15.780> that

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
guys just need to understand that

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.070 
guys just need to understand that
playing<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:18.000> same<00:06:18.210> game<00:06:18.450> every<00:06:18.630> day<00:06:18.870> isn't

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
playing the same game every day isn't

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.130 
playing the same game every day isn't
always<00:06:19.320> fun<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:20.360> especially<00:06:21.360> when<00:06:21.840> the<00:06:21.930> game

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
always fun and especially when the game

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.770 
always fun and especially when the game
is<00:06:22.380> not<00:06:22.980> at<00:06:23.790> its<00:06:24.270> best

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
is not at its best

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.679 
is not at its best
I<00:06:25.380> guess<00:06:25.890> potential

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689 
I guess potential

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.109 
I guess potential
