00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
first thing I suggest to do is to make

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
Sally's but this is the one I prefer

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.619 
Sally's but this is the one I prefer
it's<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.129> big<00:00:48.280> sexy<00:00:48.489> volumizing<00:00:49.420> dry<00:00:49.510> shampoo

it's the big sexy volumizing dry shampoo

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's the big sexy volumizing dry shampoo
the<00:00:50.289> reason<00:00:50.500> why<00:00:50.590> I<00:00:50.620> like<00:00:50.829> this<00:00:51.039> is<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.280> feel

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
the reason why I like this is I feel

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.069 
the reason why I like this is I feel
like<00:00:51.489> it<00:00:51.760> works<00:00:52.210> a<00:00:52.390> little<00:00:52.449> better<00:00:52.690> last

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
like it works a little better last

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.069 
like it works a little better last
little<00:00:53.320> longer<00:00:53.649> than<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.660> cheaper<00:00:55.660> versions

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
little longer than the cheaper versions

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.840 
little longer than the cheaper versions
and<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:56.500> like<00:00:56.739> that<00:00:56.920> it<00:00:57.010> gives<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.370> volumizing

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
and I like that it gives it a volumizing

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.330 
and I like that it gives it a volumizing
effect<00:00:58.269> so<00:00:58.930> this<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.199> really<00:00:59.410> easy<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.739> use<00:01:00.039> all

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
effect so this is really easy to use all

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
effect so this is really easy to use all
you<00:01:01.300> have<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.629> do<00:01:01.750> is<00:01:02.100> part<00:01:03.100> your<00:01:03.280> hair<00:01:03.489> and

are<00:01:26.470> going<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.829> be<00:01:26.950> able<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.220> get<00:01:27.430> onto<00:01:27.640> your

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
are going to be able to get onto your

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.810 
are going to be able to get onto your
bangs<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.210> little<00:01:28.240> bit<00:01:28.600> easier<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.820> prevent

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
bangs a little bit easier so prevent

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.280 
bangs a little bit easier so prevent
that<00:01:31.030> if<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.450> give<00:01:31.630> your<00:01:31.659> hair<00:01:31.899> a<00:01:31.930> little<00:01:32.079> bit

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
that if you give your hair a little bit

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.380 
that if you give your hair a little bit
more<00:01:32.470> volume<00:01:32.770> it's<00:01:33.130> going<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.399> not<00:01:33.579> get<00:01:33.970> greasy

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
more volume it's going to not get greasy

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.539 
more volume it's going to not get greasy
as<00:01:34.750> fast<00:01:35.170> as<00:01:35.500> if<00:01:35.920> your<00:01:36.070> hair<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.280> laying<00:01:36.490> flat

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
as fast as if your hair is laying flat

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.700 
as fast as if your hair is laying flat
down<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.630> that's<00:01:37.810> why<00:01:37.990> if<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.229> ever<00:01:38.409> have<00:01:38.619> your

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
down so that's why if you ever have your

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.139 
down so that's why if you ever have your
hair<00:01:38.890> really<00:01:39.100> voluminous<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.820> curly<00:01:40.060> you

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
hair really voluminous and curly you

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.460 
hair really voluminous and curly you
might<00:01:40.329> find<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.899> wear<00:01:41.079> it<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.259> few

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
might find that you can wear it a few

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.469 
might find that you can wear it a few
days<00:01:41.680> whereas<00:01:42.460> if<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.700> just<00:01:42.729> wear<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.299> really

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
days whereas if you just wear it really

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.600

I<00:04:59.570> wouldn't<00:04:59.990> recommend<00:05:00.290> doing<00:05:00.500> this<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.800> lot

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
I wouldn't recommend doing this a lot

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.320 
I wouldn't recommend doing this a lot
because<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.580> don't<00:05:01.730> want<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:01.910> get<00:05:02.030> into<00:05:02.300> a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
because you don't want to get into a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.480 
because you don't want to get into a
cycle<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.960> washing<00:05:03.800> your<00:05:03.830> hair<00:05:04.070> too<00:05:04.280> much

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
cycle of washing your hair too much

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.830 
cycle of washing your hair too much
where<00:05:04.760> you're<00:05:04.880> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.090> over<00:05:05.330> produce<00:05:05.600> oil

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
where you're going to over produce oil

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.260 
where you're going to over produce oil
but<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.530> case<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.950> severe<00:05:07.220> emergency<00:05:07.790> that<00:05:08.060> is

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
but in case of severe emergency that is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.810 
but in case of severe emergency that is
something<00:05:08.540> I<00:05:08.660> do<00:05:08.720> as<00:05:08.930> well<00:05:09.110> so<00:05:09.820> basically

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
something I do as well so basically

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.490 
something I do as well so basically
those<00:05:11.450> are<00:05:11.510> probably<00:05:11.780> all<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.080> things<00:05:12.260> I<00:05:12.380> do

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
those are probably all the things I do

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.160 
those are probably all the things I do
with<00:05:12.560> your<00:05:12.680> hair<00:05:12.919> and
