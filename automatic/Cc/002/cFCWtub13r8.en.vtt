00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.900 
those notes on three strings as triplets
and<00:00:13.620> we're<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:13.860> going<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> go<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> neck

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
and we're just going to go up the neck

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.300 
and we're just going to go up the neck
but<00:00:15.150> obviously<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.630> could<00:00:15.750> go<00:00:15.839> down<00:00:16.020> too<00:00:16.310> so

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
but obviously we could go down too so

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:45.350 
but obviously we could go down too so
this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> lick<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:25.970> slowly

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
as far as actually using these

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.680 
as far as actually using these

most<00:00:50.230> commonly<00:00:50.590> you'll<00:00:50.950> see<00:00:51.160> them<00:00:51.370> used<00:00:52.330> over

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
most commonly you'll see them used over

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.250 
most commonly you'll see them used over
a<00:00:53.170> five<00:00:53.890> seven<00:00:54.430> chord<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.510> minor<00:00:55.750> four<00:00:56.050> chord

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
a five seven chord in a minor four chord

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.080 
a five seven chord in a minor four chord
progression<00:00:56.770> so<00:00:57.100> for<00:00:57.250> example<00:00:57.610> if<00:00:57.760> you're<00:00:58.000> in

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
progression so for example if you're in

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:06.440 
progression so for example if you're in
the<00:00:58.180> key<00:00:58.330> of<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.510> minor<00:00:59.520> B<00:01:00.520> /<00:01:00.760> e<00:01:00.970> seven<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:05.040> he

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the key of a minor B / e seven just a he

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.969 
the key of a minor B / e seven just a he
the<00:01:07.450> reason<00:01:07.630> why<00:01:07.870> that<00:01:08.020> works<00:01:08.290> is<00:01:08.620> the

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
the reason why that works is the

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.680 
the reason why that works is the
diminished<00:01:09.910> 7th<00:01:10.240> chord<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:12.100> pgo<00:01:12.690> functions

diminished 7th chord or pgo functions

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.650 
diminished 7th chord or pgo functions
basically<00:01:13.990> as<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.680> e7<00:01:15.160> chord<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:16.270> basically

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
basically as the e7 chord it's basically

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.859 
basically as the e7 chord it's basically
you<00:01:17.650> can<00:01:17.830> view<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.100> as<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:19.470> c7<00:01:20.470> with<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.619> flat<00:01:20.860> 9<00:01:21.869> -

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
you can view it as a c7 with a flat 9 -

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.260 
you can view it as a c7 with a flat 9 -
the<00:01:22.900> root<00:01:23.110> note<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.490> what<00:01:24.670> we're<00:01:24.759> gonna<00:01:24.850> do<00:01:25.060> for

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
the root note so what we're gonna do for

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.240 
the root note so what we're gonna do for
lick<00:01:25.720> 2<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.710> just<00:01:26.770> take<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.160> basic<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.670> minor<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
lick 2 is just take a basic a minor to

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.340 
lick 2 is just take a basic a minor to
e7<00:01:30.550> chord<00:01:30.700> progression<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.690> we're<00:01:32.229> just

my<00:04:34.610> bad<00:04:34.790> technique<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.389> just<00:04:36.110> used<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.350> doing<00:04:36.500> a

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
my bad technique I just used to doing a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.580 
my bad technique I just used to doing a
live<00:04:36.710> with<00:04:36.830> my<00:04:37.010> third<00:04:37.280> finger<00:04:38.080> in<00:04:39.080> lick<00:04:39.290> six

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
live with my third finger in lick six

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.629 
live with my third finger in lick six
we're<00:04:39.800> actually<00:04:39.889> just<00:04:40.070> gonna<00:04:40.340> use<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.610> same

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
we're actually just gonna use the same

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.939 
we're actually just gonna use the same
pattern<00:04:41.000> but<00:04:41.180> do<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> finger<00:04:42.290> taps<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:42.830> we're

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
pattern but do a finger taps so we're

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.420 
pattern but do a finger taps so we're
gonna<00:04:43.389> do<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.419> full<00:04:44.810> string<00:04:45.169> so<00:04:45.949> I<00:04:46.040> fall<00:04:46.250> in<00:04:46.310> that

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
gonna do a full string so I fall in that

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.300 
gonna do a full string so I fall in that
tap<00:04:46.669> or<00:04:47.180> full<00:04:47.600> note<00:04:47.750> pull<00:04:47.930> off<00:04:48.080> skip<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.100> string

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
tap or full note pull off skip a string

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.969 
tap or full note pull off skip a string
into<00:04:49.580> another<00:04:49.820> four<00:04:50.000> note<00:04:50.150> pull<00:04:50.330> off<00:04:50.979> and

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
into another four note pull off and

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.920 
into another four note pull off and
we're<00:04:52.850> just<00:04:52.910> gonna<00:04:53.030> do<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.419> like<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.570> double

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
we're just gonna do it is like a double

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:02.740 
we're just gonna do it is like a double
tap<00:04:54.139> like<00:04:54.350> this<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:02.150> it'll<00:05:02.479> sound<00:05:02.630> something

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
tap like this and it'll sound something

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:19.150 
tap like this and it'll sound something
like<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.889> this<00:05:04.010> looks<00:05:04.250> six<00:05:18.010> notes<00:05:19.010> in

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
like this so this looks six notes in

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.129 
like this so this looks six notes in
there<00:05:19.280> but<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:20.300> basic<00:05:20.600> idea<00:05:20.840> is<00:05:20.930> something

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
there but the basic idea is something

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:34.850 
there but the basic idea is something
like<00:05:21.289> this

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.010 

so<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.849> was<00:05:35.940> a<00:05:35.970> bit<00:05:36.180> of<00:05:36.270> an<00:05:36.360> overview<00:05:36.599> of<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
so that was a bit of an overview of the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.140 
so that was a bit of an overview of the
minister<00:05:37.530> with<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.740> PGA's<00:05:38.220> they're<00:05:38.849> really

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
minister with the PGA's they're really

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.580 
minister with the PGA's they're really
useful<00:05:39.539> when<00:05:40.020> you're<00:05:40.080> sawing<00:05:40.319> in<00:05:40.500> the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
useful when you're sawing in the

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.450 
useful when you're sawing in the
harmonic<00:05:41.009> minor<00:05:41.159> or<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:41.759> Phrygian<00:05:42.120> dominant

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
harmonic minor or the Phrygian dominant

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.070 
harmonic minor or the Phrygian dominant
but<00:05:44.460> they're<00:05:44.580> also<00:05:44.699> good<00:05:45.030> just<00:05:45.629> for<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.810> basic

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
but they're also good just for the basic

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.110 
but they're also good just for the basic
metal<00:05:46.349> stuff<00:05:46.590> like<00:05:47.129> because<00:05:47.819> it's<00:05:47.940> got<00:05:48.060> the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
metal stuff like because it's got the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.640 
metal stuff like because it's got the
kind<00:05:48.270> of<00:05:48.330> evil<00:05:48.629> sound<00:05:48.840> to<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.110> just<00:05:49.500> for

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
kind of evil sound to it just for

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.210 
kind of evil sound to it just for
example<00:05:50.039> you<00:05:50.099> know<00:05:54.710> you<00:05:55.710> can<00:05:55.830> actually<00:05:55.919> just

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
example you know you can actually just

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.740 
example you know you can actually just
do<00:05:56.370> it<00:05:56.460> dramatically<00:05:56.879> which<00:05:57.120> is<00:05:57.270> going<00:05:57.479> out<00:05:57.599> of

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
do it dramatically which is going out of

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:06.469 
do it dramatically which is going out of
key<00:05:57.960> but<00:05:58.530> like<00:06:05.000> it's<00:06:06.000> got<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:06.120> really<00:06:06.300> cool

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
key but like it's got a really cool

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.059 
key but like it's got a really cool
sound<00:06:06.720> well<00:06:07.199> they're<00:06:07.440> really<00:06:07.710> great<00:06:07.860> for

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
sound well they're really great for

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.520 
sound well they're really great for
metal<00:06:08.539> alright<00:06:09.539> so<00:06:09.810> hopefully<00:06:10.020> that<00:06:10.289> all<00:06:10.380> made

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
metal alright so hopefully that all made

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.170 
metal alright so hopefully that all made
sense<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:11.159> I'll<00:06:11.610> guess<00:06:11.759> I'll<00:06:11.880> see<00:06:12.060> you<00:06:12.120> next

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
sense and I'll guess I'll see you next

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.050 
sense and I'll guess I'll see you next
time<00:06:12.539> bye
