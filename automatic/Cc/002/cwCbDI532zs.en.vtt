their welter at Burgos which was a

four-day stage race in the middle of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.200 
four-day stage race in the middle of
August<00:01:04.949> he<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.430> looking<00:01:05.640> pretty<00:01:05.670> ominous

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
August he was looking pretty ominous

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
August he was looking pretty ominous
particularly<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> final<00:01:07.320> mountaintop

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
particularly on the final mountaintop

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
particularly on the final mountaintop
finish<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> believe<00:01:08.970> he<00:01:09.090> finished<00:01:09.420> third

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
finish where I believe he finished third

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530 
finish where I believe he finished third
and<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.310> was<00:01:11.460> looking<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:12.060> strong

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and and was looking really strong

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.330 
and and was looking really strong
yeah<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.110> he's<00:01:13.350> always<00:01:13.530> planned<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
yeah and he's always planned to have a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
yeah and he's always planned to have a
peak<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> second<00:01:15.240> half<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> season

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
peak in the second half of the season

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
peak in the second half of the season
because<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> course<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.009> Florence<00:01:17.430> World

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
because of course the Florence World

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.969 
because of course the Florence World
Championships<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.420> home<00:01:18.689> soil<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.650> suit

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
Championships on home soil really suit

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.980 
Championships on home soil really suit
him<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.340> he's<00:01:20.490> had<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> break<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> middle

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
him so he's had that break in the middle

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.600 
him so he's had that break in the middle
but<00:01:22.080> looks<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.560> coming<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> tour

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
but looks to be coming good for the tour

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.679 
but looks to be coming good for the tour
span<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> course<00:01:24.150> he's<00:01:24.240> won<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.540> event

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
span of course he's won this event

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.230 
span of course he's won this event
before<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.409> 2010<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.580> he<00:01:26.670> knows<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> race

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
before back in 2010 so he knows the race

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
before back in 2010 so he knows the race
well<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.780> he<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.470> could<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.920> big

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
well and he I think could be a big

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
well and he I think could be a big
threat<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> were<00:01:30.030> saying<00:01:30.180> Berger<00:01:30.689> seemed

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

their Mahlum own ten down whether or not

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
their Mahlum own ten down whether or not
they're<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.530> contention<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.190> don't<00:03:08.400> know<00:03:08.550> at

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
they're in contention I don't know at

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580 
they're in contention I don't know at
the<00:03:08.850> fact<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.120> monomer<00:03:09.630> was<00:03:09.959> struggling<00:03:10.350> so

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the fact that monomer was struggling so

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.840 
the fact that monomer was struggling so
much<00:03:10.620> at<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.100> end<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.340> Tour<00:03:11.519> de<00:03:11.610> France

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
much at the end of the Tour de France

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.330 
much at the end of the Tour de France
think<00:03:12.180> they<00:03:12.300> said<00:03:12.570> he<00:03:12.660> had<00:03:12.840> flu<00:03:13.140> tonight<00:03:13.500> you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
think they said he had flu tonight you

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.100 
think they said he had flu tonight you
can<00:03:14.519> trace<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.970> France<00:03:15.269> with<00:03:15.420> flu<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.930> I

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
can trace it to France with flu so I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.840 
can trace it to France with flu so I
guess<00:03:16.440> he<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:16.739> fatigued<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.549> one

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
guess he was just fatigued so one

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.430 
guess he was just fatigued so one
wonders<00:03:18.030> whether<00:03:18.329> he<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.600> recover<00:03:18.870> from<00:03:19.079> that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
wonders whether he can recover from that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.370 
wonders whether he can recover from that
but<00:03:20.310> clearly<00:03:20.760> two<00:03:21.239> seriously<00:03:21.930> strong<00:03:22.140> guys

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
but clearly two seriously strong guys

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.920 
but clearly two seriously strong guys
there<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:22.820> there's<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.880> possibility<00:03:24.030> isn't<00:03:24.480> it

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
there so there's a possibility isn't it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.990 
there so there's a possibility isn't it
now<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.709> Vuelta<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.160> actually<00:03:26.400> started<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
now the Vuelta is actually started in a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.789 
now the Vuelta is actually started in a
team<00:03:27.209> time<00:03:27.450> trial<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.930> last<00:03:28.079> few<00:03:28.350> years

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
team time trial for the last few years

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.410 
team time trial for the last few years
well<00:03:29.070> this<00:03:29.250> year<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.430> slightly<00:03:29.820> different<00:03:30.269> in

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
well this year is slightly different in

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.660 
well this year is slightly different in
its<00:03:30.720> 27<00:03:31.440> kilometers<00:03:31.920> long<00:03:32.070> which<00:03:32.519> is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
its 27 kilometers long which is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.069 
its 27 kilometers long which is
significantly<00:03:33.420> longer<00:03:33.570> than<00:03:33.750> any<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.989> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
significantly longer than any of the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.509 
significantly longer than any of the
others<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.709> we're<00:03:34.799> gonna<00:03:34.890> see<00:03:35.100> some<00:03:35.280> quite<00:03:35.489> big

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
others so we're gonna see some quite big

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.940 
others so we're gonna see some quite big

from<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.220> beginning<00:03:38.340> then<00:03:39.060> actually<00:03:39.360> on

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
from the beginning then actually on

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.270 
from the beginning then actually on
stage<00:03:39.630> 2<00:03:39.989> we'll<00:03:40.290> see<00:03:40.470> them<00:03:40.650> take<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.070> out<00:03:41.250> on

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
stage 2 we'll see them take it out on

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920 
stage 2 we'll see them take it out on
each<00:03:41.400> other<00:03:41.549> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> road<00:03:42.150> because<00:03:42.690> there's<00:03:42.840> a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
each other on the road because there's a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.500 
each other on the road because there's a
pretty<00:03:43.310> significant<00:03:44.310> summit<00:03:44.640> finish<00:03:44.820> even<00:03:45.420> as

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
pretty significant summit finish even as

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.150

kilometers long at an average grading at
5.6<00:03:49.380> percent<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.160> we'll<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:50.430> some<00:03:50.459> time<00:03:50.790> gaps

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
5.6 percent so we'll see some time gaps
