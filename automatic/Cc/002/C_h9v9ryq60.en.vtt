you<00:00:19.170> only<00:00:19.320> need<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.740> piece<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.220> paper<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
you only need one piece of paper to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.089 
you only need one piece of paper to
complete<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.180> design<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.460> here<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.550> go

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
complete this design so here we go

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
complete this design so here we go
I'm<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> start<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.510> colored<00:00:28.199> side

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
I'm going to start with the colored side

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.939 
I'm going to start with the colored side
facing<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.630> I'm<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> fold<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.560> both

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
facing up I'm going to fold it on both

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.260 
facing up I'm going to fold it on both
diagonals<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> then<00:00:35.090> horizontally<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
diagonals and then horizontally and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
diagonals and then horizontally and
vertically<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:39.140> want<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> make<00:00:40.290> sure<00:00:40.320> your

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
vertically I want to make sure your

00:00:40.620 --> 00:01:01.479 
vertically I want to make sure your
folds<00:00:40.980> line<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:41.610> neat<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.719> possible

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.990 

there<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:02.629> go<00:01:02.780> now<00:01:04.630> pull<00:01:05.630> push<00:01:06.320> both<00:01:07.190> sides<00:01:07.670> in

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
there you go now pull push both sides in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.880 
there you go now pull push both sides in
towards<00:01:08.450> each<00:01:08.570> other<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.930> forms<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.470> point

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
towards each other so it forms a point

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.520 
towards each other so it forms a point
on<00:01:13.130> top<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:18.050> crease<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:20.259> then<00:01:21.259> you're<00:01:21.380> going

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
on top and crease it then you're going

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.020 
on top and crease it then you're going
to<00:01:21.619> take<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:22.040> point<00:01:23.080> push<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.229> upwards<00:01:24.409> and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.660 

fold<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.149> into<00:01:29.300> a<00:01:29.450> square<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.250> see<00:01:34.490> this

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
fold it into a square you can see this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.859 
fold it into a square you can see this
you<00:01:35.240> can<00:01:35.270> open<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> square<00:01:36.170> up<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.399> sides

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
you can open the square up and the sides

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.359 
you can open the square up and the sides
meet<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:40.850> all<00:01:41.810> right<00:01:42.020> now<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.860> begin<00:01:43.190> working

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
meet that all right now to begin working

on<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.610> bird<00:01:45.340> going<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.460> fold<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.770> top

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
on the bird going to fold just the top

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.029 
on the bird going to fold just the top
layer<00:01:49.220> there<00:01:49.789> are<00:01:49.940> two<00:01:50.210> layers<00:01:50.710> only<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.830> top

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
layer there are two layers only the top

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.550 
layer there are two layers only the top
and<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.550> meet<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.880> center<00:01:53.119> line<00:01:56.289> I'm<00:01:57.289> going<00:01:57.470> to

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
and to meet the center line I'm going to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080 
and to meet the center line I'm going to
do<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.800> same<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.280> other<00:01:58.310> side<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.909> want

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
do the same on the other side you want

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.149 
do the same on the other side you want
to<00:01:59.119> make<00:01:59.179> sure<00:01:59.450> that<00:02:00.020> they<00:02:00.200> do<00:02:00.259> not<00:02:00.500> overlap

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
to make sure that they do not overlap

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.710 
to make sure that they do not overlap
these<00:02:01.909> two<00:02:02.119> flaps<00:02:02.390> do<00:02:02.569> not<00:02:02.750> overlap<00:02:04.720> then

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
these two flaps do not overlap then

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.870 
these two flaps do not overlap then
you're<00:02:05.840> going<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.049> fold<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.470> top<00:02:06.680> down<00:02:07.630> and

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
you're going to fold the top down and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.190 
you're going to fold the top down and
open<00:02:10.880> all<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.269> stuff<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:11.840> fold<00:02:12.049> it

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
open all the stuff that you just fold it

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.810 
open all the stuff that you just fold it
those<00:02:12.380> are<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.799> pre<00:02:13.040> creases<00:02:13.519> as<00:02:13.670> you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
those are just the pre creases as you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.289 
those are just the pre creases as you
can<00:02:13.940> see<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.150> made<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.600> three<00:02:14.810> creases<00:02:16.150> now<00:02:17.150> I'm

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
can see I made it three creases now I'm

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.630 
can see I made it three creases now I'm
going<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.600> take<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.019> very<00:02:18.200> top<00:02:18.530> layer<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.250> I'm

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
going to take the very top layer and I'm

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.440 
going to take the very top layer and I'm
going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.910> fold<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:20.480> back<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:22.060> until<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
going to fold this back just until the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.750 
going to fold this back just until the
crease<00:02:24.850> then<00:02:25.850> on<00:02:25.970> both<00:02:26.180> sides<00:02:27.340> I'm<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.640> to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
crease then on both sides I'm going to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:38.760 
crease then on both sides I'm going to
flatten<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.239> down

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.860 

like<00:02:39.770> so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
like so

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.240 
like so
now<00:02:41.870> I'll<00:02:41.990> flip<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.290> over<00:02:42.380> into<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.800> exact

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
now I'll flip it over into the exact

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.000 
now I'll flip it over into the exact
same<00:02:43.280> thing<00:02:43.850> on<00:02:43.970> this<00:02:44.120> side<00:02:44.650> first<00:02:45.650> folding

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
same thing on this side first folding

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:59.500 
same thing on this side first folding
both<00:02:46.220> sides<00:02:46.520> into<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.820> center<00:02:46.910> line<00:02:58.510> then

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
both sides into the center line then

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:18.930 
both sides into the center line then
folding<00:02:59.960> the<00:03:00.080> top<00:03:00.290> down

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.280 

all<00:03:19.940> right<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:22.280> now<00:03:22.430> see<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:24.050> can

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
all right so you now see that you can

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.560 
all right so you now see that you can
fold<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:24.920> top<00:03:25.310> part<00:03:25.610> down<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.360> see<00:03:26.540> a

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
fold this top part down and you see a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.080 
fold this top part down and you see a
triangle<00:03:26.960> here<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.490> going<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.850> be<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
triangle here this is going to be the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.850 
triangle here this is going to be the
wings<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.600> body<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.170> bird<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.650> want

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
wings and body of the bird and you want

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.540 
wings and body of the bird and you want
it<00:03:31.010> facing<00:03:31.430> up<00:03:32.650> now<00:03:33.650> down<00:03:33.860> here<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.220> see<00:03:34.370> there

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
it facing up now down here you see there

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.000 
it facing up now down here you see there
are<00:03:34.640> two<00:03:34.850> layers<00:03:35.110> I'm<00:03:36.110> going<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.440> take<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.770> top

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
are two layers I'm going to take the top

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.270 
are two layers I'm going to take the top
layer<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.550> fold<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:39.110> do<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.920> same<00:03:40.070> on

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
layer and fold it in and do the same on

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:51.340 
layer and fold it in and do the same on
the<00:03:40.340> opposite<00:03:40.730> side<00:03:49.630> then<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.660> will<00:03:50.960> flip<00:03:51.230> it

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
the opposite side then I will flip it

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.950 
the opposite side then I will flip it
over<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:52.030> once<00:03:53.030> again<00:03:53.180> fold<00:03:53.540> these<00:03:53.690> sides

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
over and once again fold these sides

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.130 
over and once again fold these sides
into<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.350> middle<00:03:55.570> everything<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.690> symmetric

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
into the middle everything is symmetric

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.540 
into the middle everything is symmetric
so<00:03:57.260> what<00:03:57.350> you<00:03:57.470> do<00:03:57.560> on<00:03:57.680> one<00:03:57.860> side<00:03:58.070> you'll<00:03:58.280> do<00:03:58.430> on

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
so what you do on one side you'll do on

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:11.260 
so what you do on one side you'll do on
the<00:03:58.640> other<00:03:58.760> side<00:04:07.810> then<00:04:08.810> from<00:04:09.080> here<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:11.000> going

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
the other side then from here I'm going

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.780 
the other side then from here I'm going
to<00:04:11.390> take<00:04:11.780> this<00:04:12.020> part<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.560> make<00:04:13.490> what<00:04:13.670> will

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
to take this part and make what will

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.350 
to take this part and make what will
become<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.420> tail<00:04:15.110> of<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.530> bird<00:04:15.910> by<00:04:16.910> flipping

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
become the tail of the bird by flipping

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.850 
become the tail of the bird by flipping
it<00:04:17.450> up<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:19.540> folding<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.660> in<00:04:23.620> then<00:04:24.620> on<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
it up and folding it in then on the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.420 
it up and folding it in then on the
other<00:04:25.010> side<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:25.340> will<00:04:25.580> do<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.000> exact<00:04:26.480> same<00:04:26.750> fold

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.310 

like<00:04:31.430> that

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
like that

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.120 
like that
and<00:04:33.410> then<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.220> make<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.520> head<00:04:35.680> I'll<00:04:36.680> take<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
and then to make the head I'll take the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.080 
and then to make the head I'll take the
tip<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:39.490> fold<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.640> in<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:43.490> will<00:04:43.760> be<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
tip and fold it in and that will be the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.400 
tip and fold it in and that will be the
head<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.390> beak<00:04:44.960> of<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.620> crane<00:04:49.510> from<00:04:50.510> here<00:04:50.840> I'm

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
head and beak of the crane from here I'm

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.060 
head and beak of the crane from here I'm
just<00:04:51.710> going<00:04:51.980> to<00:04:52.100> gently<00:04:52.640> open<00:04:53.030> up<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.510> wings

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
just going to gently open up the wings

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.060 
just going to gently open up the wings
making<00:04:55.070> sure<00:04:55.250> not<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.520> rip<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.150> body<00:05:00.070> you
