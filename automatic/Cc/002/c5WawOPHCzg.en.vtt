00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
hi I'm Parker Pierce I'm an artist and

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.140 
hi I'm Parker Pierce I'm an artist and
today<00:00:07.890> I'm<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> show<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> do

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
today I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.890 
today I'm going to show you how to do
self-portraits<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.050> middle<00:00:10.230> school<00:00:10.670> so

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
self-portraits for middle school so

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.680 
self-portraits for middle school so
portraits<00:00:12.900> always<00:00:13.349> require<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:14.219> way<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.389> self

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
portraits always require a way of self

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.200 
portraits always require a way of self
referencing<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:17.160> order<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> draw<00:00:17.580> accurately

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
referencing in order to draw accurately

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.290 
referencing in order to draw accurately
so<00:00:19.020> we're<00:00:19.140> gonna<00:00:19.289> need<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.470> mirror<00:00:20.119> also<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
so we're gonna need a mirror also the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.590 
so we're gonna need a mirror also the
rules<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:22.320> make<00:00:22.350> portraits<00:00:22.910> whether<00:00:23.910> you're<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
rules to make portraits whether you're a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.670 
rules to make portraits whether you're a
kid<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:24.900> adult<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.500> always<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> same<00:00:27.680> there's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
kid or adult are always the same there's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.890 
kid or adult are always the same there's
different<00:00:29.310> methods<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.730> drawing<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.810> now

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
different methods of drawing but for now

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.269 
different methods of drawing but for now
I'm<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.199> gonna<00:00:31.439> show<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> basic

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I'm just gonna show the basic

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.450 
I'm just gonna show the basic
construction<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.739> generally<00:00:35.190> speaking

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
construction so generally speaking

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.979 
construction so generally speaking
you'll<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> block<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> shape<00:00:36.780> like

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you'll want to block in a shape like

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.979 
you'll want to block in a shape like
I've<00:00:37.170> done<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> use

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
I've done to do so you want to use

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.650 
I've done to do so you want to use
3-dimensional<00:00:40.800> shapes<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.399> very<00:00:42.210> common

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
3-dimensional shapes a very common

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590 
3-dimensional shapes a very common
method<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.610> constructing<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.820> head<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> using

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
method of constructing a head is using

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380 
method of constructing a head is using
the<00:00:45.690> Loomis<00:00:45.989> method<00:00:46.760> you<00:00:47.760> generally<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the Loomis method you generally use a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
the Loomis method you generally use a
sphere<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> planes<00:00:49.649> cut<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.160> either

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
sphere with the planes cut off on either

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
sphere with the planes cut off on either
side<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.610> make<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.000> wedge<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
side and you make the wedge which is the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
side and you make the wedge which is the
face<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.899> build<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
face and from there you build on all the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.880 
face and from there you build on all the
different<00:00:59.550> features<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> something

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
different features and this is something

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.189 
different features and this is something
that<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.300> middle<00:01:03.449> school<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.019> can

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that you can do in middle school you can

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.800 
that you can do in middle school you can
do<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.409> high<00:01:04.589> school<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> really<00:01:06.540> want

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
do in high school but if you really want

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.770 
do in high school but if you really want
to<00:01:06.930> impress<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.680> middle<00:01:08.010> school<00:01:08.100> classmates

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
to impress your middle school classmates

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.080 
to impress your middle school classmates
learning<00:01:09.780> something<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.090> Loomis

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
learning something like the Loomis

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
learning something like the Loomis
method<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.049> great<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:13.890> his<00:01:14.369> books

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
method is a great way to go his books

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.420 
method is a great way to go his books
can<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.820> found<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> web<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.979> they<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
can be found on the web and they are in

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.130 
can be found on the web and they are in
public<00:01:17.700> domain<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.869> ahead<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
public domain so you can go ahead and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.570 
public domain so you can go ahead and
find<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:21.030> once<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> locked<00:01:22.049> in

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
find them so once you have it locked in

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.350 
find them so once you have it locked in
you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.759> use<00:01:24.000> different<00:01:24.360> types<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.840> planes<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
you can use different types of planes to

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
you can use different types of planes to
construct<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:28.500> features<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> where<00:01:29.159> they're

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
construct the features and where they're

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.679 
construct the features and where they're
located<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:31.159> then<00:01:32.159> after<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.119> your

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
located and then after you have your

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.050 
located and then after you have your
construction<00:01:34.140> blocked<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.820> start

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
construction blocked in you can start

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.130 
construction blocked in you can start
placing<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.890> value<00:01:37.890> chunks<00:01:38.810> these<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:39.960> pieces

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
placing in value chunks these are pieces

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.620 
placing in value chunks these are pieces
of<00:01:40.350> light<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> dark<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.740> show

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
of light and dark that you use to show

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.649 
of light and dark that you use to show
where<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> light<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.869> coming<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:47.570> now<00:01:48.570> I'm

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
where the light is coming from now I'm

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.410 
where the light is coming from now I'm
just<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.110> emphasizing<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.950> cheek<00:01:50.420> just

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
just kind of emphasizing this cheek just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.440 
just kind of emphasizing this cheek just
because<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> sell<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> point<00:01:53.450> but

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
because I want to sell the point but

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.630 
because I want to sell the point but
you'll<00:01:54.600> always<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.170> come<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.430> your

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you'll always have to come back to your

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
you'll always have to come back to your
actual<00:01:57.030> life<00:01:57.240> reference<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.049> make<00:01:58.200> sure<00:01:58.439> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
actual life reference to make sure you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.889 
actual life reference to make sure you
have<00:01:59.390> your<00:02:00.390> lighting<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.079> spot<00:02:01.409> so

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
have your lighting in the right spot so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.540 
have your lighting in the right spot so
that<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:05.490> how<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.909> draw<00:02:06.090> portraits<00:02:07.550> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that is how you can draw portraits in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.029 
that is how you can draw portraits in
