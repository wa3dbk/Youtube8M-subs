00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
activation screen so what I had to do

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.699 
activation screen so what I had to do
was<00:03:10.090> take<00:03:10.239> out<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.570> sim<00:03:10.750> card<00:03:10.780> turn<00:03:11.260> my<00:03:11.410> phone

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.140 
off put it back in and reboot and that
is<00:03:14.290> what<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.650> may<00:03:14.799> have<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.190> do<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.580> may<00:03:15.910> take

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
is what you may have to do it may take

two<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.480> three<00:03:16.510> tries<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.470> end<00:03:17.590> it

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
two to three tries but in the end it

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.620 
two to three tries but in the end it
will<00:03:18.040> work<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.610> will<00:03:18.790> actually<00:03:18.940> register

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
will work and it will actually register

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.600 
will work and it will actually register
much<00:03:19.840> faster<00:03:20.290> after<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.709> no<00:03:20.980> longer<00:03:21.220> than<00:03:21.459> 30

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610
