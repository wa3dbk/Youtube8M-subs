00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
goes on realism you don't really get a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.020 
goes on realism you don't really get a
lot<00:02:03.230> of<00:02:03.290> clumping<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.130> doing<00:02:04.370> really<00:02:04.640> careful

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
because I'm of the fibers may go into

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.560

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
careful that so I really like the result

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.690 
careful that so I really like the result
on<00:02:17.000> my<00:02:17.090> lashes<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.690> really<00:02:17.930> made<00:02:18.080> them<00:02:18.200> longer

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
on my lashes it really made them longer

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.430 
on my lashes it really made them longer
just<00:02:19.700> something<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.750> didn't<00:02:21.080> like<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.410> lot

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
just something that I didn't like a lot

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.200 
just something that I didn't like a lot
is<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.920> some<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.340> fibers<00:02:22.790> when<00:02:23.030> it's

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
is that some of the fibers when it's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.100 
is that some of the fibers when it's
taken<00:02:23.510> all<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:24.880> fibers<00:02:25.880> won't<00:02:26.360> stick<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:26.960> all

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
taken all like fibers won't stick on all

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.650 
taken all like fibers won't stick on all
of<00:02:27.320> your<00:02:27.440> lashes<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:29.120> would<00:02:29.300> make<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
of your lashes so that would make the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.590 
of your lashes so that would make the
end<00:02:29.990> result<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.650> little<00:02:30.950> bit<00:02:31.070> uneven<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:32.240> um

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
end result a little bit uneven but um

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.530 
end result a little bit uneven but um
it's<00:02:33.110> nothing<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:33.800> bothers<00:02:34.310> me<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:35.060> lot<00:02:35.270> if

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.390 
it's nothing that bothers me a lot if
that's<00:02:35.960> something<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.380> would<00:02:36.680> bother<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.190> I
