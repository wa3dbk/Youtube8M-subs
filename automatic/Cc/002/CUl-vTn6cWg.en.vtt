00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
years ago and that's when you first

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.929 
years ago and that's when you first
started<00:02:01.829> growing<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> beard<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
started growing the beard out but that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
started growing the beard out but that
was<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.479> were<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.930> whatever<00:02:04.680> I'm

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
was when you were just like whatever I'm

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.319 
was when you were just like whatever I'm
just<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> grow<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> beard<00:02:05.909> out<00:02:06.090> until

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
just going to grow the beard out until

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.830 
just going to grow the beard out until
somebody<00:02:06.600> notices<00:02:07.140> me<00:02:07.290> right

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
somebody notices me right

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.509 
somebody notices me right
and<00:02:08.080> then<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.349> had<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.649> trim<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.039> a<00:02:09.099> little<00:02:09.129> bit

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
and then I had to trim it a little bit

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.320 
and then I had to trim it a little bit
and<00:02:09.759> actually<00:02:10.209> I<00:02:10.269> think<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.869> started<00:02:12.330> maybe

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and actually I think I started maybe

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.170 
and actually I think I started maybe
around<00:02:14.430> SummerSlam<00:02:15.430> last<00:02:15.640> year<00:02:15.910> it's<00:02:16.000> kind<00:02:16.150> of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
around SummerSlam last year it's kind of

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.089 
around SummerSlam last year it's kind of
when<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.330> started<00:02:16.660> growing<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.769> trimmed

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
when I started growing it and I trimmed

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.040 
when I started growing it and I trimmed
it<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> couple<00:02:18.459> times<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:18.970> then<00:02:19.209> there<00:02:19.900> was<00:02:19.930> a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
it a couple times but then there was a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.320 
it a couple times but then there was a
point<00:02:20.290> during<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.190> year<00:02:21.430> rises<00:02:21.879> like<00:02:22.030> nope

the performance center that they built

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.940 
the performance center that they built
and<00:02:31.750> I've<00:02:31.900> been<00:02:31.959> thinking<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.349> lot<00:02:32.379> about<00:02:32.530> this

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and I've been thinking a lot about this

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.789 
and I've been thinking a lot about this
because<00:02:33.160> there<00:02:33.819> seems<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.930> lot<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.590> focus

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
because there seems to be a lot of focus

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.759 
because there seems to be a lot of focus
on<00:02:36.220> taking<00:02:36.459> guys<00:02:36.819> who<00:02:37.269> are<00:02:37.390> either<00:02:37.680> from<00:02:38.680> the
