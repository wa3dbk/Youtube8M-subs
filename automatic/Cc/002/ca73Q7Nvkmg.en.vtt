00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.030
 then we have radio fm 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.630
 by continent must put the headphones to be able yeah earphones 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.329
 disconnect so it's classic 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.479
 it works pretty well we could navigate the ski resorts so that's 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:15.579
 get drunk pass 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.160
 in fact we understand better one thing is clear that I'm drunk using street 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.289
 of marquette anyway and replace it will replace it by marie 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.150
 marquette for rotten bonds by cons 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.699
 they have it drunk ab what will be published under bada 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.750
 and effect here under this android phone that helps bring some 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.269
 really special content like preinstalled content dot sound 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.239
 that you can find here some tricks some demos some widgets 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.489
 if it's really the particular thing but is not intended to replace andré 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.720
 marquet so there we took our experts there were other things too but i 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.910
 already installed 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.970
 you can find some titles like in fact I was loaded asphalt 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520
 anyway I think I'll go 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.670
 we will not play or not 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.650
 this masterpiece and that's it 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.730
 I do not know if they have advanced 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.020
 with regard to this lettuce is quickly done 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.020
 she installed on apple and galaxy s 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.920
 crysis 2 who are 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 so an increase 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.550
 me thompson 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.880
 pleasure 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.790
 I think he had planted and I do not really know 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.170
 ok we left 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.400
 you go to this point on the galaxy if it is rather fluid 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.579
 % with the path of the win it works as well 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.749
 accelerator and reagent 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.389
 the graphics are are pretty cool me I think that will lead 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.639
 when i do not know what you think it is they may have an iphone 4 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:25.219
 for me 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.679
 they will be able to compare 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.689
 e 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.519
 we are not far from this kind of this kind of result is there I have one 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.699
 fluid game that plays well 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.689
 that fill rather pretty 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.089
 winner to predict both the strong man or even all the places that 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:41.569
 will be able to turn on the leading men 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:42.699
 terminal 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.519
 the best asset 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.229
 in roncq 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.080
 and then in more than 200 marquette flights who who sees there 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.419
 especially by paying the best reindeer teams 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.729
 quick is used this kind of specifications with their Rhone club 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.429
 giguère this stuff 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.429
 why there I want to go back 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.239
 even leave 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.239
 so this summer for pascal 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.049
 this masterpiece 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.150
 it allows you to attack all your social colo networks on a greenhouse 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.180
 a single screen but the best it is good it is also to install the applications 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.579
 like later facebook you can find in the indre and marquette 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.870
 we have a system that got that 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.150
 then will actually be running software that makes it an application that allows you to 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.489
 see these documents online it was rare 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.189
 yet your system this kind of things itunes applications quickly 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.839
 misperceived 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:41.179
 a capacity that went more and more so it's pretty cool 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.240
 the most I wish is that you can actually say 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.389
 access your account 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.389
 that's the two-week account of the point fr 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.159
 he could not read 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 for video of course 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.079
 they stand that it works very very well in the field where he did so 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.799
 it's a bit like a year ago 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.369
 facilitate it 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.459
 and then I think I went around but% and now the goal was 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.930
 loaded a maximum of applications to enrich it thoroughly 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.780
 it is used here and maximizes the capabilities of this kind of terminal 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.349
 last point 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.580
 I do not think I've tested 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.629
 the r8 phone 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.889
 jcp if I'm going to be able 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.610
 on the menu a little jostled 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.449
 a lot of our people 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.199
 so poultry by dialing sausage number and that's what made 100 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:40.949
 points 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.939
 it works like that and if in addition you have buttons 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:48.489
 there it is button to appeal the mere thought of a videoconference 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.550
 we are not going and in bone you have the call log the favorites the 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.430
 combos favorite contacts and directory access to adductors 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.270
 directly 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.349
 hysice 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.719
 so that's it for this ice test and finally pushed it 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.400
 galaxy s 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.210
 with whom in my opinion at present one of the terminals and yafran 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.610
 undetermined since interesting 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.909
 percent under android 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.069
 and if the most powerful donations points by telling me the highlights 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.309
 main are in my opinion the big screen 4 inches 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.860
 super amoled more rare reagent 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.870
 the scandal reacted yesterday what we find everywhere but who 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.279
 begins to really show his power 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.400
 and then at this interface picking over 100 m 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.470
 however it can not last anymore 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.060
 who rather nice back that does not necessarily this father for them 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.270
 users are not too kitsch 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.800
 so here is an excellent android smartphone that is we are on a 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.389
 galaxy s see you soon
