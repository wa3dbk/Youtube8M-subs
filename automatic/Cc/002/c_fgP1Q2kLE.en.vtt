29th 2009 and it's been a bit of a
challenging<00:00:08.790> week<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.450> me<00:00:09.599> here<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:10.679> far<00:00:10.920> as

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
challenging week for me here as far as

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.549 
challenging week for me here as far as
these<00:00:11.309> origami<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.210> day<00:00:12.360> calendar<00:00:12.929> videos

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
these origami of the day calendar videos

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.970 
these origami of the day calendar videos
are<00:00:14.099> concerned<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.849> got<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.599> updated<00:00:16.170> software

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
are concerned I got the updated software

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.929 
are concerned I got the updated software
version<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.480> iMovie<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.980> gave<00:00:20.910> me

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
version for the iMovie and that gave me

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.599 
version for the iMovie and that gave me
a<00:00:21.119> few<00:00:21.359> snags<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.260> terms<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.039> learning<00:00:23.369> curve

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
a few snags in terms of a learning curve

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.570 
a few snags in terms of a learning curve
that<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.910> wasn't<00:00:24.119> expecting<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.189> then<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.279> just

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that I wasn't expecting and then I just

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.359 
that I wasn't expecting and then I just
had<00:00:26.730> trouble<00:00:26.910> getting<00:00:27.150> things<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.810> upload<00:00:28.369> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
had trouble getting things to upload to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.370 
had trouble getting things to upload to
YouTube<00:00:29.789> over<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> course<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> last<00:00:31.140> day

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
YouTube over the course of the last day

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.010 
YouTube over the course of the last day
so<00:00:31.910> we're<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> little<00:00:33.180> slower<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.870> than<00:00:33.989> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
so we're a little slower going than I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.470 
so we're a little slower going than I
would<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.290> preferred<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.329> hopefully<00:00:36.329> we're

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
would have preferred but hopefully we're

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
would have preferred but hopefully we're
back<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.899> track<00:00:37.260> now

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
back on track now

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.700 
back on track now
so<00:00:39.360> today's<00:00:40.850> model<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.690> rooster<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.270> as

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
so today's model is a rooster and as

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.319 
so today's model is a rooster and as
before<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> other<00:00:47.340> models<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.879> week<00:00:48.120> we

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
before for the other models this week we

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.340 
before for the other models this week we
are<00:00:48.450> starting<00:00:48.930> out<00:00:49.050> using<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> helmet<00:00:50.070> base

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
are starting out using that helmet base

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
are starting out using that helmet base
so<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.160> over<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.489> briefly<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.149> case

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
so I will go over that briefly in case

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.670 
so I will go over that briefly in case

last<00:01:10.950> few<00:01:11.490> models<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.200> tuning<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
last few models and are just tuning in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.999 
last few models and are just tuning in
let<00:01:14.850> me<00:01:14.939> show<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.680> helmet

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
let me show you how to do the helmet

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
let me show you how to do the helmet
base<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.000> particular<00:01:18.330> model<00:01:18.810> starts

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
base that this particular model starts

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.120 
base that this particular model starts
out<00:01:20.270> using<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.650> doing<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
out using what you will be doing is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.200 
out using what you will be doing is
taking<00:01:23.159> your<00:01:23.759> piece<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.409> origami<00:01:25.409> paper

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
taking your piece of origami paper

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.590 
taking your piece of origami paper
starting<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.229> white<00:01:28.890> side

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
starting out with it with the white side

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.410 
starting out with it with the white side
facing<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.340> fold<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.700> half<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
facing up you fold it in half on the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.460 
facing up you fold it in half on the
diagonal<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.850> then<00:01:35.850> fold<00:01:36.270> down<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.290> two

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
diagonal and then fold down the two

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.149 
diagonal and then fold down the two
corners<00:01:38.009> toward<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> center<00:01:39.890> creating<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
corners toward the center creating a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.149 
corners toward the center creating a
smaller<00:01:41.490> square<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.899> daimond<00:01:43.530> depending<00:01:44.040> on

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
smaller square or daimond depending on

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.999 
smaller square or daimond depending on
how<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> hold<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.530> helmet

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
how you hold it and that's your helmet

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
how you hold it and that's your helmet
base<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> from<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> position<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> helmet

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
base so from the position of the helmet

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.830 
base so from the position of the helmet
base<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.399> first<00:01:53.729> fold<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
base the first fold that you're going to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.249 
base the first fold that you're going to
do<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:56.130> mountain<00:01:56.549> fold<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.119> remember<00:01:57.540> what

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
do is a mountain fold and remember what

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.249 
do is a mountain fold and remember what
that<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.920> basically<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.670> fold<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that is is basically to fold it in a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.429 
that is is basically to fold it in a
directions<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> mountain<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.630> you've<00:02:04.200> got

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
directions like a mountain so you've got

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.219 
directions like a mountain so you've got
the<00:02:04.649> helmet<00:02:04.920> base<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.000> flaps<00:02:06.299> here

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the helmet base with the flaps here

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.100 
the helmet base with the flaps here
facing<00:02:07.770> down<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.340> you're<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> fold<00:02:09.810> it

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
facing down and you're going to fold it

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.430 
facing down and you're going to fold it
in<00:02:10.319> half

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.670 

so<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.910> loose<00:02:14.870> flaps<00:02:15.200> are<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
so that the the loose flaps are to the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.720 
so that the the loose flaps are to the
outside<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.630> admittedly<00:02:21.410> when<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.220> looked<00:02:22.610> at

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
outside so admittedly when I looked at

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.510 
outside so admittedly when I looked at
the<00:02:22.880> directions<00:02:23.390> for<00:02:23.690> these<00:02:23.840> next<00:02:24.500> two<00:02:24.860> folds

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
the directions for these next two folds

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.330 
the directions for these next two folds
I<00:02:25.700> found<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.990> little<00:02:27.260> confusing<00:02:28.010> at

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
I found it to be a little confusing at

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.550 
I found it to be a little confusing at
first<00:02:28.640> trying<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.330> figure<00:02:29.420> out<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:30.470> exactly

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
first trying to figure out what exactly

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.880 
first trying to figure out what exactly
they<00:02:30.980> wanted<00:02:31.310> me<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.460> do<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:33.500> took<00:02:33.680> me<00:02:33.860> a

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
they wanted me to do and it took me a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.730 
they wanted me to do and it took me a
little<00:02:33.980> bit<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:35.600> get<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.960> but<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> did<00:02:36.500> get<00:02:36.680> it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
little bit to get it but I did get it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.450 
little bit to get it but I did get it
and<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:38.090> think<00:02:38.270> it's<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.530> folds<00:02:40.280> that's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
and I think it's one of the folds that's

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.070 
and I think it's one of the folds that's
most<00:02:40.760> more<00:02:41.210> difficult<00:02:41.690> for<00:02:41.840> me<00:02:41.960> to

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
most more difficult for me to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.310 
most more difficult for me to
demonstrate<00:02:42.340> thus<00:02:43.340> far<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.270> I'm<00:02:44.870> gonna<00:02:45.050> give

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
demonstrate thus far but I'm gonna give

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.730 
demonstrate thus far but I'm gonna give
it<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.500> whirl

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
it a whirl

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.950 
it a whirl
so<00:02:47.020> here<00:02:48.020> we<00:02:48.170> are<00:02:48.200> at<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.890> point<00:02:49.220> where<00:02:50.150> you

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
so here we are at this point where you

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.930 
so here we are at this point where you
folded<00:02:51.470> your<00:02:51.650> piece<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:52.040> half<00:02:52.190> again<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
folded your piece in half again and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.930 
folded your piece in half again and
you've<00:02:53.150> got<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.540> flaps<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.440> both<00:02:55.040> sides<00:02:55.430> you

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
you've got the flaps on both sides you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.040 
you've got the flaps on both sides you
can<00:02:56.090> see<00:02:56.240> if<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.390> hold<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.690> like<00:02:56.750> this<00:02:56.900> right<00:02:58.030> now

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
can see if I hold it like this right now

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.250 
can see if I hold it like this right now
what<00:03:00.050> you're<00:03:00.290> doing<00:03:00.320> is<00:03:01.190> gonna<00:03:02.090> be<00:03:02.390> folding

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
what you're doing is gonna be folding

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.550 
what you're doing is gonna be folding
this<00:03:04.040> flap<00:03:04.790> up<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:08.390> while<00:03:08.720> you're<00:03:09.050> doing<00:03:09.080> that

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
this flap up but while you're doing that

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.530 
this flap up but while you're doing that
and<00:03:10.130> I'll<00:03:10.310> hold<00:03:10.520> it<00:03:10.640> up<00:03:10.760> here<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.210> can<00:03:11.360> see

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and I'll hold it up here so you can see

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.080 
and I'll hold it up here so you can see
while<00:03:12.050> you're<00:03:12.200> doing<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.400> are<00:03:13.430> pushing

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
while you're doing that you are pushing

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
while you're doing that you are pushing
in<00:03:14.720> on<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:16.100> point<00:03:16.370> cuz<00:03:17.090> you've<00:03:17.570> got<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.930> like

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
in on the point cuz you've got it like

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.850 
in on the point cuz you've got it like
this<00:03:18.440> you're<00:03:19.430> pulling<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.090> up<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.860> pushing

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
this you're pulling this up and pushing

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.410 
this you're pulling this up and pushing
in<00:03:22.160> at<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.930> same<00:03:24.140> time<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.030> create

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
in at the same time so that you create

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.720 
in at the same time so that you create
something<00:03:26.920> it's<00:03:27.920> almost<00:03:28.190> like<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.430> double

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
something it's almost like a double

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.930 
something it's almost like a double
folding<00:03:29.600> action<00:03:29.810> you've<00:03:30.500> got<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.860> fold<00:03:31.130> here

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
folding action you've got the fold here

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.410 
folding action you've got the fold here
and<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.780> cross<00:03:33.020> this<00:03:33.590> way<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.880> once<00:03:35.240> you've

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
and the cross this way and once you've

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.840 
and the cross this way and once you've
completed<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:36.080> on<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.380> one<00:03:36.590> side<00:03:36.860> you're

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
completed it on the one side you're

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.840 
completed it on the one side you're
going<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.120> flip<00:03:38.390> your<00:03:38.450> piece<00:03:39.290> over<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.670> the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
going to flip your piece over and do the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.720 
going to flip your piece over and do the
same<00:03:41.060> thing<00:03:41.510> exactly<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.500> same<00:03:42.709> thing<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.250> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
same thing exactly the same thing on the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.050 
same thing exactly the same thing on the
other<00:03:43.760> side<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.870> you're<00:03:45.050> pushing<00:03:46.060> you're

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
other side so you're pushing you're

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.449 
other side so you're pushing you're
pulling<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.660> up<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.320> as<00:03:48.830> you<00:03:48.980> pull<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.250> up

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
pulling this up and as you pull it up

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.500 
pulling this up and as you pull it up
you're<00:03:50.270> gonna<00:03:50.390> be<00:03:50.600> pushing<00:03:51.020> in<00:03:51.560> on<00:03:52.510> that

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
you're gonna be pushing in on that

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.910 
you're gonna be pushing in on that
corner<00:03:54.640> on<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.670> point<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.680> have<00:03:57.890> a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
corner on that point so that you have a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.710 
corner on that point so that you have a
double<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:59.810> have<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.080> double<00:04:00.380> fold<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:02.540> it's

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
double you have the double fold so it's

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.810 
double you have the double fold so it's
it's<00:04:03.200> flapped<00:04:03.739> over<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.310> look<00:04:04.459> at<00:04:04.580> here

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
it's flapped over if you look at here

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.390 
it's flapped over if you look at here
it's<00:04:04.970> flapped<00:04:05.239> over<00:04:05.600> there<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.370> you've<00:04:07.370> got

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
it's flapped over there and you've got

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.409 
it's flapped over there and you've got
it<00:04:07.760> here<00:04:08.030> as<00:04:08.150> well<00:04:10.780> okay

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.030 

now<00:04:16.419> what<00:04:16.690> you're<00:04:16.810> going<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.109> do<00:04:17.380> from<00:04:17.680> this

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
now what you're going to do from this

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.379 
now what you're going to do from this
point<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:19.030> an<00:04:19.989> inside<00:04:20.650> reverse<00:04:21.210> fold<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:23.250> this

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
point is an inside reverse fold at this

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:32.070 
point is an inside reverse fold at this
at<00:04:25.389> this<00:04:26.199> point<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:27.760> you're<00:04:29.010> pushing<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:31.080> and

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
at this point so you're pushing in and

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.170 
at this point so you're pushing in and
folding<00:04:32.919> in<00:04:34.169> like<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:37.110> there's<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.169> a

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
folding in like that and there's a a

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.689 
folding in like that and there's a a
pretty<00:04:40.180> good<00:04:40.330> angle<00:04:40.479> here<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:44.550> from<00:04:45.550> this

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
pretty good angle here so from this

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:58.269 
pretty good angle here so from this
place<00:04:47.729> open<00:04:48.729> it<00:04:48.850> up<00:04:49.949> push<00:04:50.949> it<00:04:50.979> inside<00:04:52.020> itself

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.229 

so<00:04:58.819> it<00:04:58.939> looks<00:04:59.089> like<00:04:59.269> this<00:05:00.669> so<00:05:01.669> this<00:05:01.849> bit<00:05:02.089> that

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:02.239 
so it looks like this so this bit that

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:05.289 
so it looks like this so this bit that
you<00:05:02.329> just<00:05:02.569> folded<00:05:03.259> by<00:05:03.439> doing<00:05:03.799> that<00:05:03.949> it's<00:05:04.339> going

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:05.299 
you just folded by doing that it's going

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:08.919 
you just folded by doing that it's going
to<00:05:05.449> really<00:05:05.989> be<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.439> feet<00:05:06.889> of<00:05:07.189> the<00:05:08.029> rooster<00:05:08.479> so

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:08.929 
to really be the feet of the rooster so

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:10.329 
to really be the feet of the rooster so
what<00:05:09.079> you<00:05:09.169> need<00:05:09.349> to<00:05:09.529> do<00:05:09.679> before<00:05:10.189> you<00:05:10.309> start

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:10.339 
what you need to do before you start

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.229 
what you need to do before you start
your<00:05:10.729> next<00:05:10.909> step<00:05:11.269> is<00:05:11.739> rotating<00:05:12.739> it<00:05:12.829> around<00:05:13.239> so

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:14.239 
your next step is rotating it around so

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:19.809 
your next step is rotating it around so
that<00:05:14.269> now<00:05:14.659> those<00:05:15.019> feet<00:05:15.379> are<00:05:15.649> at<00:05:15.769> the<00:05:15.919> bottom<00:05:18.819> so

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
that now those feet are at the bottom so

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.569 
that now those feet are at the bottom so
the<00:05:19.909> first<00:05:20.149> part<00:05:20.419> of<00:05:20.689> folding<00:05:21.259> the<00:05:21.859> roosters

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:22.579 
the first part of folding the roosters

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:27.969 
the first part of folding the roosters
head<00:05:22.939> is<00:05:23.589> to<00:05:24.589> take<00:05:25.189> the<00:05:25.549> top<00:05:25.909> piece<00:05:26.509> up<00:05:27.439> here

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
head is to take the top piece up here

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.679 
head is to take the top piece up here
because<00:05:28.339> there's<00:05:28.669> two<00:05:28.879> layers<00:05:29.119> here<00:05:29.269> you're

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:29.689 
because there's two layers here you're

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.850 
because there's two layers here you're
taking<00:05:30.049> the<00:05:30.169> top<00:05:30.409> layer<00:05:31.209> and<00:05:32.529> you're<00:05:33.529> going<00:05:33.829> to

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
taking the top layer and you're going to

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.739 
taking the top layer and you're going to
fold<00:05:34.459> it<00:05:34.909> backwards

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:37.749 
fold it backwards

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.949 
fold it backwards
so<00:05:38.749> here<00:05:38.989> it<00:05:39.079> is<00:05:39.229> and<00:05:39.889> I<00:05:40.009> folded<00:05:40.639> it<00:05:41.149> backwards

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:41.959 
so here it is and I folded it backwards

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:51.159 
so here it is and I folded it backwards
in<00:05:42.259> a<00:05:42.349> little<00:05:42.969> triangle<00:05:45.399> like<00:05:46.399> so<00:05:48.489> and<00:05:50.169> then

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
in a little triangle like so and then

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.929 
in a little triangle like so and then
the<00:05:51.289> last<00:05:51.529> thing<00:05:52.159> that<00:05:52.189> you're<00:05:52.429> going<00:05:52.579> to<00:05:52.789> do

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:52.939 
the last thing that you're going to do

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:58.989 
the last thing that you're going to do
is<00:05:54.189> to<00:05:55.189> create<00:05:55.869> the<00:05:56.869> beak<00:05:57.109> and<00:05:57.699> that<00:05:58.699> is

00:05:58.989 --> 00:05:58.999 
is to create the beak and that is

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.989 
is to create the beak and that is
folding<00:05:59.599> it<00:05:59.689> in<00:05:59.839> the<00:05:59.959> this<00:06:00.529> second<00:06:01.399> piece<00:06:01.699> in

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 
folding it in the this second piece in

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.999 
folding it in the this second piece in
the<00:06:02.179> other<00:06:02.360> direction<00:06:02.839> so<00:06:03.079> you're<00:06:03.409> taking<00:06:03.829> it

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
the other direction so you're taking it

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.529 
the other direction so you're taking it
and<00:06:04.999> pushing<00:06:05.479> in<00:06:05.629> that<00:06:05.839> little<00:06:06.199> bit<00:06:06.409> there

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
and pushing in that little bit there

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.059 
and pushing in that little bit there
hold<00:06:08.539> it<00:06:08.689> I'll<00:06:09.049> hold<00:06:09.289> it<00:06:09.409> down<00:06:09.619> where<00:06:09.799> you<00:06:09.919> can

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
hold it I'll hold it down where you can

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.049 
hold it I'll hold it down where you can
sell<00:06:10.309> fleas<00:06:10.579> to<00:06:10.759> get<00:06:10.879> better<00:06:12.669> you're<00:06:13.669> taking

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:14.059 
sell fleas to get better you're taking

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.759 
sell fleas to get better you're taking
this<00:06:14.269> pushing<00:06:14.989> down<00:06:15.169> that<00:06:15.439> little<00:06:16.159> bit<00:06:16.719> and

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:17.769 
this pushing down that little bit and

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:26.140 
this pushing down that little bit and
folding<00:06:18.769> it<00:06:18.889> in

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.620 

so<00:06:26.900> you<00:06:26.990> end<00:06:27.229> up<00:06:27.350> with<00:06:27.740> a<00:06:28.750> little<00:06:29.750> beak<00:06:30.280> and

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
so you end up with a little beak and

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:39.490 
so you end up with a little beak and
that's<00:06:32.630> your<00:06:32.810> rooster<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:38.020> that's<00:06:39.020> it<00:06:39.260> that's
