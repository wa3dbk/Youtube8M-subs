that actually deletes the map or the
world<00:05:15.970> when<00:05:16.449> you<00:05:16.539> die

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
world when you die

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.350 
world when you die
so<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.590> basically<00:05:17.770> gets<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.880> lot<00:05:19.330> more

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
so it basically gets a lot more

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.620 
so it basically gets a lot more
interesting<00:05:19.599> and<00:05:20.260> a<00:05:20.349> lot<00:05:20.830> harder<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:22.360> think

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
interesting and a lot harder I think

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.469 
interesting and a lot harder I think
that<00:05:23.080> quite<00:05:23.620> fun<00:05:23.889> I'm<00:05:24.099> gonna<00:05:24.550> try<00:05:24.789> to<00:05:24.820> survive
