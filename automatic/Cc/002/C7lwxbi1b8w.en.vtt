00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.560
 sooner or later this question 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.220
 Each person thinks well or almost 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.619
 each 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.480
 someone in 16 years and someone with the arrival 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.280
 gray hair 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:39.460
 which car to choose domestic 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.309
 or imported new or boo as he loved 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.379
 to say henry ford uch car it 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.879
 new but it all depends on your 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.280
 financial well-being 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.440
 of what amount are you willing to part for 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.140
 car and our time to buy 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.960
 car is quite easy the same 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.829
 loan but can you keep it in 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.390
 the future is taxes insurance 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.500
 maintenance and all sorts of unforeseen 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.199
 circumstances 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.450
 I personally would when choosing a car on 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.369
 first place put security but 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.630
 I can give you a hundred percent safety 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.580
 we have no one to think 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.080
 when you come to the salon chooses 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.539
 car you do not ask 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.619
 manager how many security stars 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.740
 by his system 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.869
 end kat takes this or that car 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.490
 you are interested in the appearance of comfort 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.410
 any additional options 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.050
 Well, you do not think about safety 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.130
 buying the first chinese cars 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.330
 remember there were such chery amulet and this 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.729
 some kind of foil 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.690
 cars because of the place noise isolation of them 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.630
 there was sand but let's go back with you all 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.909
 such real life 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.159
 and 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.880
 start from the beginning when you only 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.880
 got right and get on the road 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.880
 motorists 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.560
 I would advise beginners to beginners 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.299
 drive in driving school you most likely 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.860
 trained on the front arrival 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.959
 cars and some initial 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.290
 practical driving skills you got 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.590
 exactly on the front wheel drive car 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.079
 front-wheel drive 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.939
 better keep the road in winter before 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.730
 I was nine I moved to 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.760
 on the mark on a fairly heavy german and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.019
 reading blew up the yards know it happens 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.049
 such snow porridge 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.030
 and under it ice you cauldron ulia is porridge 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.730
 flew out and your wheels went on the ice a 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.150
 as the burn is light as such 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.700
 no, and you happen to be on the front drive 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.190
 it would be enough to twist the wheel in 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.620
 one side or the other and find some 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.500
 hook on the rear wheel drive lifetime of the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 You can not get through the buildup 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.400
 somehow leave 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.609
 but it doesn't always work out 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.680
 ask someone for help and ice 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.439
 it is easier to drive on the front drive 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.200
 than in the back there but if you 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.169
 born drifter or want to buy 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.340
 car where more than 300 horses, yes 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.709
 worth a look 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.069
 or to rear wheel drive or better complete and 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.629
 novices like no driving experience i would 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.680
 advised to look at the paternal 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.540
 manufacturer it will be cheaper 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.709
 technically in the future if you 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.980
 squeeze the clutch 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.400
 or entry into another pit smash 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.290
 suspension and most likely your first 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.139
 car you will beat 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.419
 but if not in an accident then he has 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.229
 somewhere in the swamp especially 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.690
 female when they still do not feel 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.159
 sizing says your car 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.829
 somewhere in the parking lots in the courtyards 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.680
 I will surely break all the bumper and only 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.680
 your car but let's say yours 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.570
 bumper on a domestic car is worth 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.070
 45 thousand can order the color of the car 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.659
 a foreign car is it will pour you somewhere 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.760
 thousands in 15-20 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:34.970
 still bring Chinese not painted 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.830
 bumper that you have to paint on 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.790
 personal to you but give it to the service and yet 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.790
 extra money to pay bids 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.650
 Well, you say that there is a parking 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.390
 systems 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.890
 rearview camera but some 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.110
 it does not always help individuals 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.500
 Further when you will have experience 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.870
 driving experience with the car you 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.210
 sell the Shatov version and buy 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.970
 yourself something more expensive that you more 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.700
 I hope you like this release somehow 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.830
 help with the decision to choose a model not 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.040
 if not for your dream 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.820
 Well, at least for real life 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.820
 I'll see you
