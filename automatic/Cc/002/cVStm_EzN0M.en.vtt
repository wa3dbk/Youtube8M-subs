in the brain well lots of things are
going<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:15.000> not<00:00:15.240> something<00:00:15.690> that

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
going on and it it's not something that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.930 
going on and it it's not something that
we<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:16.109> summarize<00:00:16.440> easily<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> few

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
we can summarize easily for a few

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.970 
we can summarize easily for a few
reasons<00:00:18.119> one<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.080> depends<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.710> whether

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
reasons one is it depends on whether

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.070 
reasons one is it depends on whether
it's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.310> person<00:00:20.670> who's<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:20.880> starting<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it's a person who's just starting out to

it's a person who's just starting out to
do<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.369> bring<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.850> someone<00:00:24.150> who's

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
do this or we bring in someone who's

do this or we bring in someone who's
done<00:00:24.840> thirty<00:00:25.740> five<00:00:26.039> thousand<00:00:26.550> hours<00:00:26.789> of

shows and what a novice shows may be
quite<00:00:32.579> different<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:34.290> will<00:00:34.559> differ<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.219> a

function of even though what I think

John<00:00:39.030> said<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.649> really<00:00:40.770> important<00:00:41.730> in

John said is is is really important in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.290 
John said is is is really important in
terms<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.500> measure<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> brain<00:00:44.340> if

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
terms of what we measure in the brain if

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049 
terms of what we measure in the brain if
you<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:46.050> using<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.829> breath<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.520> an<00:00:47.910> object

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you are using your breath as an object

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.080 
you are using your breath as an object
of<00:00:48.600> focus<00:00:49.050> versus<00:00:49.620> using<00:00:49.950> an<00:00:50.219> external<00:00:50.579> visual

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
of focus versus using an external visual

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
of focus versus using an external visual
stimulus<00:00:51.629> there'll<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.140> somewhat<00:00:52.739> different

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
stimulus there'll be somewhat different

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
stimulus there'll be somewhat different
parts<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> brain<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.090> involved<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
parts of the brain that are involved the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.920 
parts of the brain that are involved the
one<00:00:55.199> thing<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.649> could<00:00:55.860> say<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.270> networks

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
one thing we could say is that networks

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.000 
one thing we could say is that networks
that<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.620> important<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.420> attention<00:01:00.420> are

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
that are important for attention are

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.090 
that are important for attention are
engaged<00:01:02.010> by<00:01:02.550> these<00:01:03.000> practices<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.920> can

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
engaged by these practices and we can

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
engaged by these practices and we can
say<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.549> certain<00:01:05.850> ways<00:01:06.000> strengthened<00:01:06.720> which

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
say in certain ways strengthened which

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.370 
say in certain ways strengthened which
parts<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> brain<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.250> activated<00:01:08.729> well

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
parts of the brain are activated well

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
parts of the brain are activated well
particularly<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.880> regions<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
particularly the regions in the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.850 
particularly the regions in the
prefrontal<00:01:12.510> cortex<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:13.500> play<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> very

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
prefrontal cortex which play a very

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.990 
prefrontal cortex which play a very
important<00:01:14.520> role<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.840> aspects<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> attention

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
important role in aspects of attention

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
important role in aspects of attention
but<00:01:18.000> again<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.630> depends<00:01:19.049> upon<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.500> person's

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
but again it depends upon a person's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.190 
but again it depends upon a person's
level<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.490> expertise<00:01:21.090> we've<00:01:21.420> seen<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.900> very

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
level of expertise we've seen in very

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.730 
level of expertise we've seen in very
expert<00:01:22.680> practitioners<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> prefrontal

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
expert practitioners that the prefrontal

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
expert practitioners that the prefrontal
cortex<00:01:25.880> comes<00:01:26.880> online<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:27.840> brief

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
cortex comes online for very brief

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160 
cortex comes online for very brief
periods<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.710> time<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.720> goes<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.990> down

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
periods of time but then goes back down

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.160 
periods of time but then goes back down
to<00:01:31.229> baseline<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.420> corresponds<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.810> think

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
to baseline and it corresponds we think

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.280 
to baseline and it corresponds we think
to<00:01:34.500> reports<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.909> these<00:01:36.180> practitioners<00:01:36.630> give

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
to reports that these practitioners give

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.310 
to reports that these practitioners give
of<00:01:37.740> being<00:01:38.460> able<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> rest<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.509> awareness<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of being able to rest in awareness and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.630 
of being able to rest in awareness and
the<00:01:40.380> way<00:01:40.500> John<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:40.979> describing<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the way John was describing it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.170 
the way John was describing it
completely<00:01:42.420> effortlessly<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:45.000> don't

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
completely effortlessly it they don't

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.510 
completely effortlessly it they don't
need<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.880> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.210> effort<00:01:48.630> four-way

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
need to in a kind of effort four-way

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.200 
need to in a kind of effort four-way
yank<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> mind<00:01:51.000> back<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.079> just

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
yank the mind back because it is just

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
yank the mind back because it is just
morph<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.270> space<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.560> will<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.130> more

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
morph that space if you will is more

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.999 
morph that space if you will is more

meditators particularly Buddhist monks
to<00:02:20.670> come<00:02:20.910> into<00:02:21.060> your<00:02:21.210> lab<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.870> have

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
to come into your lab and you have

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.140 
to come into your lab and you have
watched<00:02:23.070> them<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.460> sometimes<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:23.970> are

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
watched them and sometimes these are

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390 
watched them and sometimes these are
people<00:02:24.510> who<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.840> spent<00:02:24.960> literally<00:02:25.440> tens<00:02:25.740> of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
people who have spent literally tens of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.700 
people who have spent literally tens of
thousands<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.000> hours<00:02:27.410> meditating<00:02:28.410> over<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
thousands of hours meditating over the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.530 
thousands of hours meditating over the
course<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.100> their<00:02:29.250> lives<00:02:29.430> what<00:02:30.120> have<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.300> seen

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
course of their lives what have you seen

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.750 
course of their lives what have you seen
in<00:02:30.600> these<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.410> think<00:02:31.920> you've<00:02:32.040> described<00:02:32.550> them

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
in these I think you've described them

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.630 
in these I think you've described them
as<00:02:33.000> sort<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.770> Olympic<00:02:35.160> athletes

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
as sort of like the the Olympic athletes

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.360 
as sort of like the the Olympic athletes
of<00:02:35.790> meditation<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.890> what<00:02:37.890> have<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.070> noticed

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
of meditation that what have you noticed

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.350 
of meditation that what have you noticed
in<00:02:38.670> them<00:02:38.850> well<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.710> work<00:02:41.000> first<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.240> all

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
in them well in that work first of all

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.940 
in them well in that work first of all
we<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.720> very<00:02:42.990> different<00:02:43.200> patterns<00:02:43.740> with

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
we see very different patterns with

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.800 
we see very different patterns with
different<00:02:44.310> kinds<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.670> meditation<00:02:44.970> practice

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
different kinds of meditation practice

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.570 
different kinds of meditation practice
so<00:02:46.580> we've<00:02:47.580> been<00:02:47.820> talking<00:02:48.360> about<00:02:48.450> mindfulness

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
so we've been talking about mindfulness

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.670 
so we've been talking about mindfulness
there<00:02:50.580> are<00:02:50.820> many<00:02:51.150> varieties<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:52.230> mindfulness

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
there are many varieties of mindfulness

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.540 
there are many varieties of mindfulness
practice<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.640> these<00:02:54.320> folks<00:02:55.320> engage<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
practice that these folks engage in and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.310 
practice that these folks engage in and
there<00:02:56.700> are<00:02:56.730> also<00:02:56.910> practices<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.020> are

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
there are also practices that are

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.070 
there are also practices that are
designed<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.250> explicitly<00:02:59.940> cultivate<00:03:00.660> certain

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
designed to explicitly cultivate certain

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.400 
designed to explicitly cultivate certain
kinds<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.850> positive<00:03:03.080> qualities<00:03:04.080> like

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
kinds of positive qualities like

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.600 
kinds of positive qualities like
compassion<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.670> loving-kindness<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.610> we

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
compassion and loving-kindness and we

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.430 
compassion and loving-kindness and we
see<00:03:08.790> differences<00:03:09.390> depending<00:03:09.690> upon<00:03:09.990> what

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
see differences depending upon what

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.070 
see differences depending upon what
practices<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.520> they're<00:03:11.820> doing<00:03:12.090> one<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
practices that they're doing one of the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.350 
practices that they're doing one of the
things<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:13.830> noticed<00:03:14.580> early<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:14.970> when

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
things that we noticed early on when

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.650 
things that we noticed early on when
people<00:03:15.600> are<00:03:15.870> doing<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.290> basic<00:03:17.660> mindfulness

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
people are doing a basic mindfulness

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.510 
people are doing a basic mindfulness
practice<00:03:19.050> particularly<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.830> kind<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.280> John

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
practice particularly the kind that John

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.490 
practice particularly the kind that John
described<00:03:21.030> where<00:03:21.270> they're<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.660> choosing<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
prefrontal region but we see it across

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.920 
prefrontal region but we see it across
widespread<00:03:38.400> regions<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.970> brain<00:03:39.120> these

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
widespread regions of the brain these

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.250 
widespread regions of the brain these

brain electrical measurement they are

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.030 
brain electrical measurement they are
oscillations<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.600> about<00:03:48.930> 40<00:03:49.380> cycles<00:03:49.590> per

of plasticity one of the things that we

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.300 
of plasticity one of the things that we
see<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:00.930> these<00:04:01.260> oscillations<00:04:02.100> are

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
see is that these oscillations are

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.820 
see is that these oscillations are
highly<00:04:02.700> synchronized<00:04:03.300> across<00:04:03.840> widespread

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
regions of the brain we also see that

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.820 
regions of the brain we also see that
when<00:04:09.090> an<00:04:09.450> external<00:04:10.110> stimulus<00:04:10.350> is<00:04:10.800> presented

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
when an external stimulus is presented

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.640 
when an external stimulus is presented
these<00:04:11.640> oscillations<00:04:12.240> become<00:04:12.930> phase<00:04:13.260> locked

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
these oscillations become phase locked

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.950 
these oscillations become phase locked
to<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.490> external<00:04:15.030> stimulus<00:04:15.240> and<00:04:15.660> what<00:04:15.750> that

to the external stimulus and what that

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.039 
to the external stimulus and what that
means<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.500> best<00:04:16.859> described<00:04:17.340> as<00:04:17.460> a<00:04:17.520> mint<00:04:17.850> in<00:04:17.910> a

means it best described as a mint in a

means it best described as a mint in a
metaphorical<00:04:19.049> way<00:04:19.310> if<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:22.260> can<00:04:22.440> imagine<00:04:22.740> a
