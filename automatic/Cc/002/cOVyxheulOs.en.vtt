00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.669
 make some garlic shrimp for this 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:36.129
 we only need 6 cloves of garlic a 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:39.970
 lemon parsley pepper and shrimp and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.059
 butter let's prepare them to see 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.320
 what do you think about the first step? 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:50.980
 Peel the garlic to chop it into pieces 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.839
 small if you like you can 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.329
 move them but I like them better 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.629
 chopped 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.699
 we are going to strip them to remove all the 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.699
 husk and then come the picamos 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.960
 Now let's chop and the bass in pieces 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960
