cover<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> bomb<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.710> he<00:01:19.830> didn't<00:01:20.100> really

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
cover on the bomb and he didn't really

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.920 
cover on the bomb and he didn't really
have<00:01:20.400> any<00:01:20.549> cover<00:01:20.759> over<00:01:20.970> there<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.299> I'm

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
have any cover over there so I'm

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870

currently winning two to one and in the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.310 
currently winning two to one and in the
fourth<00:01:24.090> round<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.570> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.869> played<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
fourth round I kind of played this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
fourth round I kind of played this
really<00:01:25.740> stupid<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.250> didn't<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.790> check<00:01:27.119> my

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
really stupid I didn't really check my

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.990 
really stupid I didn't really check my
corner<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.439> kind<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.520> thought<00:01:29.759> he

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
corner to the right I kind of thought he

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
corner to the right I kind of thought he
was<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> left<00:01:31.530> side

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
was going to be going on the left side

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
for the bomb plant at a and this is

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.309 
for the bomb plant at a and this is
actually<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> pretty<00:03:14.730> long<00:03:15.090> round<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.659> get<00:03:16.169> the

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
actually a pretty long round I get the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.349 
actually a pretty long round I get the
bomb<00:03:16.470> plant<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.370> had<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.669> defend<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.269> I

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
bomb plant and I had to defend it and I

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.580 
bomb plant and I had to defend it and I
really<00:03:18.599> didn't<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:18.900> which<00:03:19.109> direction<00:03:19.290> he

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
really didn't know which direction he

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.550 
really didn't know which direction he
was<00:03:19.739> coming<00:03:20.040> from<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.870> assumed<00:03:21.989> he<00:03:22.470> was

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
was coming from I kind of assumed he was

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.990 
was coming from I kind of assumed he was
coming<00:03:22.799> from<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:23.040> back<00:03:23.220> because<00:03:23.639> he<00:03:23.849> might

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
coming from the back because he might

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.159 
coming from the back because he might
have<00:03:24.120> flanked<00:03:24.389> around<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.870> might<00:03:25.049> have

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
have flanked around and I might have

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.110 
have flanked around and I might have
lying<00:03:25.349> around<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> kind<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.669> just<00:03:26.790> go<00:03:26.940> back

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
lying around so I kind of just go back

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.939 
lying around so I kind of just go back
here<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.419> hide<00:03:28.019> behind<00:03:28.199> these<00:03:28.440> barrels<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:28.889> I

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
here and hide behind these barrels so I

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.619 
here and hide behind these barrels so I
can<00:03:29.129> see<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> two<00:03:29.579> entrances<00:03:29.879> from<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.449> back

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
can see the two entrances from the back

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.430 
can see the two entrances from the back
and<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.829> works<00:03:32.220> out<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.150> see<00:03:33.599> him<00:03:33.840> coming<00:03:34.109> from

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.649 
and it works out I I see him coming from
the<00:03:34.560> left<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.979> far<00:03:35.220> left<00:03:35.459> side<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.849> I<00:03:36.359> kind<00:03:36.599> of

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.250 
of run up the stairs in the same room
that<00:06:07.370> I<00:06:07.520> caught<00:06:07.790> him<00:06:07.880> off<00:06:08.060> guard<00:06:08.090> before<00:06:08.480> and

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
that I caught him off guard before and

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.440 
that I caught him off guard before and
in<00:06:09.470> this<00:06:09.590> game<00:06:09.860> and<00:06:10.100> I<00:06:10.430> figured<00:06:11.090> I<00:06:11.150> would<00:06:11.270> sit

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
in this game and I figured I would sit

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.120 
in this game and I figured I would sit
in<00:06:11.540> a<00:06:11.570> different<00:06:11.930> corner<00:06:12.110> than<00:06:12.410> the<00:06:12.680> original

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
in a different corner than the original

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.130 
in a different corner than the original
time<00:06:13.340> and<00:06:13.610> this<00:06:13.820> was<00:06:14.060> kind<00:06:14.330> of<00:06:14.420> a<00:06:14.540> bad<00:06:14.750> corner

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
time and this was kind of a bad corner

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.380 
time and this was kind of a bad corner
because<00:06:15.410> my<00:06:15.770> sights<00:06:16.400> really<00:06:16.820> couldn't<00:06:17.150> cover

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
because my sights really couldn't cover
