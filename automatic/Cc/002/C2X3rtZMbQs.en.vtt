these Libyan coast areas before the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.930 
these Libyan coast areas before the
Sharpie<00:02:17.980> pen<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.370> did<00:02:18.520> not<00:02:18.610> work<00:02:18.730> at<00:02:18.880> all

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
Sharpie pen and it did not work at all

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.000 
Sharpie pen and it did not work at all
it's<00:02:19.120> moot<00:02:19.270> everywhere<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.560> didn't<00:02:20.950> even

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
it's moot everywhere so I didn't even

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.820

think<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.460> ever<00:02:21.610> try<00:02:21.880> any<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.180> these<00:02:22.240> pens<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
think to ever try any of these pens so

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.500 
think to ever try any of these pens so
if<00:02:23.830> these<00:02:24.100> work<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.460> here<00:02:24.730> well<00:02:24.940> great<00:02:25.270> too

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
if these work on here well great too

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
if these work on here well great too

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
signal and did skip a little I actually

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.170 
signal and did skip a little I actually
really<00:02:41.200> do<00:02:41.320> like<00:02:41.350> how<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.770> writes<00:02:42.070> um<00:02:42.459> it's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
really smooth and I love gel pens that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.330 
really smooth and I love gel pens that
is<00:02:45.760> what<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.000> use<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.959> either<00:02:47.530> way<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.220> would

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
probably use these I tend to just use

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.060 
probably use these I tend to just use
more<00:02:51.310> functional<00:02:51.820> pins<00:02:52.030> than<00:02:52.300> cute<00:02:52.540> pens<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.860> do

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
more functional pins than cute pens I do

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
definitely smeared and I don't know if

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.229 
definitely smeared and I don't know if
this<00:03:19.439> pen<00:03:19.709> smeared<00:03:20.099> or<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.849> it's<00:03:21.030> just

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
this pen smeared or if that it's just

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.699 
this pen smeared or if that it's just
the<00:03:21.360> dot<00:03:21.569> pen<00:03:21.780> that's<00:03:21.930> smeared<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.500> I'm<00:03:22.620> gonna

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the dot pen that's smeared so I'm gonna

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:23.569 
the dot pen that's smeared so I'm gonna
try<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.190> again

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
try that again

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.170 
try that again
I<00:03:23.700> miss<00:03:23.849> my<00:03:24.000> test<00:03:25.370> none<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.400> them<00:03:26.579> smeared<00:03:27.000> on

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
I miss my test none of them smeared on

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.479 
I miss my test none of them smeared on
here<00:03:27.480> which<00:03:27.659> is<00:03:27.690> good<00:03:30.019> okay<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.349> let's<00:03:32.190> go<00:03:32.459> back

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
here which is good okay so let's go back

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.399 
here which is good okay so let's go back
to<00:03:32.879> this<00:03:33.000> pen<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.280> uniball<00:03:35.640> signo

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
to this pen this is the uniball signo

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:44.210 
to this pen this is the uniball signo
307<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:38.250> let's<00:03:38.940> do<00:03:39.239> another<00:03:40.730> test<00:03:42.709> on<00:03:43.709> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
307 and let's do another test on the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.599 
307 and let's do another test on the
Olympian<00:03:44.549> Costa<00:03:44.909> cruise<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.980> normally

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
Olympian Costa cruise and I normally

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.280 
Olympian Costa cruise and I normally
wait<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.909> while<00:03:48.030> anyways<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.690> my<00:03:48.780> pens<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.109> dry

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
wait a while anyways for my pens to dry

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.680 
wait a while anyways for my pens to dry
because<00:03:49.739> they're<00:03:50.700> gel<00:03:50.909> pens<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.359> I<00:03:51.389> don't<00:03:51.629> know

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
because they're gel pens so I don't know

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.089 
because they're gel pens so I don't know
I<00:03:51.720> just<00:03:51.810> am<00:03:52.109> really<00:03:52.139> scared<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.620> them<00:03:52.769> smearing

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
I just am really scared of them smearing

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.160 
I just am really scared of them smearing
so<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.180> won't<00:03:54.269> be<00:03:54.389> a<00:03:54.450> problem<00:03:54.510> if<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.870> have<00:03:55.019> to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
so that won't be a problem if I have to

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.009 
so that won't be a problem if I have to
wait<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:56.269> it's<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.359> good<00:03:57.480> thing<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.780> know<00:03:57.900> not

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
wait but it's a good thing to know not

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.170 
wait but it's a good thing to know not
to<00:03:58.200> use<00:03:58.230> these<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.590> here<00:03:58.769> um<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.730> one<00:03:59.940> did

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
to use these on here um but this one did

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.020 
to use these on here um but this one did
seem<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.389> work<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.349> this<00:04:02.190> one<00:04:02.370> barely<00:04:02.790> wrote

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
seem to work and this one barely wrote

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.990 
seem to work and this one barely wrote
on<00:04:03.150> there<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:03.569> did<00:04:03.870> smear<00:04:04.139> as<00:04:04.230> well<00:04:04.409> so<00:04:04.909> but<00:04:05.909> on

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
on there and did smear as well so but on

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
hard to write on in the first place but

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.160 
hard to write on in the first place but
I'm<00:04:46.370> glad<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.580> they<00:04:47.120> out<00:04:47.210> pass<00:04:47.420> in<00:04:47.630> here<00:04:47.810> so

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
stickers but that's the fact that I
