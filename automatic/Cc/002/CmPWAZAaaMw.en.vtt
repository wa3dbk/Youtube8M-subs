00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
of the side rails cut out and then it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.910

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and the bottom for the chrome so I'm

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.420 
going to install the back piece first
I'm<00:01:40.259> probably<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> off<00:01:41.100> camera

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
I'm probably going to do it off camera
just<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.509> little<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.020> hard<00:01:43.200> for

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
just because it's a little bit hard for

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.899 
just because it's a little bit hard for
me<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> through<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> camera<00:01:44.310> lens<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
me to do it through the camera lens and

to get off so I don't know if these are

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.809 
to get off so I don't know if these are
thicker<00:04:09.780> than<00:04:10.290> some<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.310> other<00:04:11.459> skins

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
thicker than some of the other skins

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.640 
thicker than some of the other skins
because<00:04:12.060> i<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.329> used<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.720> skin<00:04:12.989> before<00:04:13.139> with

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
because i have used the skin before with

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.699 
because i have used the skin before with
my<00:04:14.030> reveal<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.209> its<00:04:15.329> work<00:04:15.510> no<00:04:15.660> problem<00:04:16.169> but

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
my reveal and its work no problem but

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.289 
my reveal and its work no problem but
man<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.160> was<00:04:17.280> very<00:04:17.579> hard<00:04:17.849> to<00:04:17.910> get<00:04:18.060> at<00:04:18.150> all<00:04:18.269> i

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
man it was very hard to get at all i

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.479 
man it was very hard to get at all i
even<00:04:19.049> had<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.260> actually<00:04:19.409> go<00:04:19.709> as<00:04:19.829> far<00:04:20.010> as<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.130> cut

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
even had to actually go as far as to cut

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.310 
even had to actually go as far as to cut
the<00:04:21.060> bottom<00:04:21.450> strip<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.900> get<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.200> work

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
the bottom strip to get it to work

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.910 
the bottom strip to get it to work
because<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:22.710> just

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
because it's just

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.670 
because it's just
pushing<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.670> corner<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.530> guess<00:04:25.530> what

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
pushing up on the corner so guess what

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.640 
pushing up on the corner so guess what
I'm<00:04:25.770> saying<00:04:25.980> is<00:04:26.190> if<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:27.000> plan<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.510> buy<00:04:28.110> the

part<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.420> problem<00:04:48.450> is<00:04:48.810> these<00:04:48.990> little

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
part of the problem is these little

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.800 
part of the problem is these little
strips<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:50.460> know<00:04:50.580> most<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.420> other<00:04:51.570> skins

strips you know most of the other skins

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.570 
strips you know most of the other skins
are<00:04:51.960> all<00:04:52.080> one<00:04:52.260> piece<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:52.890> don't<00:04:53.100> use<00:04:53.340> these

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
are all one piece if you don't use these

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.700 
are all one piece if you don't use these
little<00:04:53.850> strips<00:04:54.150> maybe<00:04:55.020> you'll<00:04:55.230> have<00:04:55.410> an

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
little strips maybe you'll have an

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.010 
little strips maybe you'll have an
easier<00:04:55.980> time<00:04:56.040> getting<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.670> on<00:04:56.820> or<00:04:57.060> off<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.540> the

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
easier time getting it on or off but the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.320 
easier time getting it on or off but the
corners<00:04:58.530> just<00:04:58.980> get<00:04:59.220> really<00:04:59.400> matched<00:04:59.790> up<00:05:00.120> when

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
corners just get really matched up when

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.560 
corners just get really matched up when
you<00:05:00.420> go<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.570> put<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.830> into<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:03.120> know<00:05:03.240> tight

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
you go to put this into a you know tight

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.110 
you go to put this into a you know tight
fitting<00:05:03.930> clear<00:05:04.200> case<00:05:04.530> um<00:05:04.920> maybe<00:05:05.640> something

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
fitting clear case um maybe something

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.610 
fitting clear case um maybe something
thinner<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.660> know<00:05:06.750> obviously<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.170> silicone

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
thinner you know obviously a silicone

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.320 
thinner you know obviously a silicone
case<00:05:07.650> but<00:05:08.460> there's<00:05:08.610> not<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.760> lot<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:08.940> crystal

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
case but there's not a lot of crystal

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.790 
case but there's not a lot of crystal
clear<00:05:09.540> ones<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.840> those<00:05:09.960> so<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.590> kind<00:05:10.770> of

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
clear ones of those so it kind of

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.550 
clear ones of those so it kind of
defeats<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.100> purpose<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:12.870> that's<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.260> you

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
defeats the purpose so that's it you

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.620 
defeats the purpose so that's it you
know<00:05:13.650> pros<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.280> cons<00:05:14.520> on<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:15.000> zagg<00:05:15.210> skin

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
know pros and cons on the zagg skin

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.900 
know pros and cons on the zagg skin
again<00:05:16.350> if<00:05:16.500> you<00:05:16.560> plan<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.800> get<00:05:17.040> them<00:05:17.190> just<00:05:17.760> make

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
again if you plan to get them just make

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.950 
again if you plan to get them just make
sure<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.120> you're<00:05:18.360> not<00:05:18.390> going<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.690> use<00:05:18.810> them

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
sure that you're not going to use them

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.870 
sure that you're not going to use them
with<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.200> case<00:05:19.410> because<00:05:19.800> they<00:05:20.520> don't<00:05:20.700> work

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
with the case because they don't work

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.040 
with the case because they don't work
with<00:05:21.120> any<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.480> ones<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.660> I've<00:05:21.810> tried

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
with any of the ones that I've tried

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.950 
with any of the ones that I've tried
again<00:05:22.950> maybe<00:05:23.220> one<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.730> two-piece<00:05:24.480> cases

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
again maybe one of the two-piece cases

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.560 
again maybe one of the two-piece cases
would<00:05:25.170> work<00:05:25.380> better<00:05:25.730> like<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.910> age<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.210> 18

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
would work better like the age of 18

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.450 
would work better like the age of 18
clear<00:05:27.810> shield<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.260> snaps<00:05:28.560> together<00:05:28.800> that

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
clear shield that snaps together that

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.700 
clear shield that snaps together that
probably<00:05:29.730> would<00:05:29.970> fit<00:05:30.180> around<00:05:30.390> this<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:31.380> none

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
probably would fit around this but none

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.340 
probably would fit around this but none

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
of these hybrid style or snap in cases

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.220 
of these hybrid style or snap in cases
will<00:05:34.500> fit<00:05:34.740> with<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:34.980> skin<00:05:35.220> on<00:05:35.340> alright<00:05:36.240> that's
