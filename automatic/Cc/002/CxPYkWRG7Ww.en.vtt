organized<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.359> bags<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:28.050> awesome<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.830> know

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
organized the bags are awesome you know

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.429 
organized the bags are awesome you know
pretty<00:00:29.730> much<00:00:29.820> labeled<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> way<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
pretty much labeled a all the way to I

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.299 
pretty much labeled a all the way to I
think<00:00:31.560> bag<00:00:31.949> s<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.690> start<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.280> step<00:00:35.280> number

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
think bag s and you start on step number

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
think bag s and you start on step number
one<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.120> open<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.930> bag<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.739> pretty

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
one and you open up bag a it's pretty

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.180 
one and you open up bag a it's pretty
simple<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.660> most<00:00:40.200> recent<00:00:40.680> bills<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
simple one of the most recent bills that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.150 
simple one of the most recent bills that
I<00:00:41.219> did<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> axial<00:00:42.420> exoteric<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:44.040> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I did was the axial exoteric and if you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.380 
I did was the axial exoteric and if you
built<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.730> those<00:00:44.850> before<00:00:45.059> you'll

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
built one of those before you'll

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.790 
built one of those before you'll
definitely<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.440> very

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
definitely know that it was very

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.279 
definitely know that it was very
disorganized<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.789> say<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> least<00:00:48.390> you'd<00:00:49.110> have

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
disorganized to say the least you'd have

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
disorganized to say the least you'd have
to<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.800> bag<00:00:50.070> F<00:00:50.370> pull<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.120> part

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to go to like bag F pull out this part

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600 
to go to like bag F pull out this part
and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.930> find<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.289> part<00:00:52.590> free<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and then go find this part free that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.450 
and then go find this part free that
didn't<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> bag<00:00:54.449> number<00:00:54.690> listed<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
didn't have a bag number listed and it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.299 
didn't have a bag number listed and it
was<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.820> very<00:00:57.059> disorganized<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.320> thumbs<00:00:59.010> up

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
was just very disorganized so thumbs up

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.240 
was just very disorganized so thumbs up
to<00:00:59.789> team<00:01:00.660> associated<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.890> build

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
to team associated on this build

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.350 
to team associated on this build
now<00:01:02.670> I've<00:01:03.000> done<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.480> four<00:01:03.989> hours<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:05.360> build

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
now I've done about four hours of build

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
now I've done about four hours of build
time<00:01:06.659> right<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.369> starting<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
time right now and I'm up to starting to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
time right now and I'm up to starting to
put<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> top<00:01:09.750> plates<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.290> I've<00:01:10.680> already<00:01:11.070> built

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
put the top plates on I've already built

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.350 
put the top plates on I've already built
both<00:01:12.330> front<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.409> rear<00:01:13.530> differentials<00:01:14.360> first

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
both front and rear differentials first

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.010 
both front and rear differentials first
time<00:01:15.570> building<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.049> ball<00:01:16.259> diff<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
time building a ball diff so I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.969 
time building a ball diff so I
definitely<00:01:19.020> had<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
definitely had a little bit of a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.200 
definitely had a little bit of a
learning<00:01:20.189> curve<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.729> I've<00:01:20.850> already<00:01:21.060> built

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
learning curve there I've already built

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
learning curve there I've already built
the<00:01:21.420> senator<00:01:21.960> slipper<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.979> about<00:01:23.310> ready<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the senator slipper and about ready to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.030 
the senator slipper and about ready to
put<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:23.970> plates<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.619> there<00:01:25.619> has<00:01:25.830> been

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
put the top plates on now there has been

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
put the top plates on now there has been
lots<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.520> Carbon<00:01:27.030> prep<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.140> haven't

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
lots of Carbon prep and if you haven't

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.830 
lots of Carbon prep and if you haven't
had<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.070> carbon<00:01:30.049> chassis<00:01:31.049> before<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.840> some

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
had a carbon chassis before it is some

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
had a carbon chassis before it is some
people<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.409> some<00:01:34.740> people<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
people do it some people don't and what

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
people do it some people don't and what
I'm<00:01:36.270> talking<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> edges<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I'm talking about are the edges of the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.539 
I'm talking about are the edges of the
carbon<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:39.150> sealed<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.619> don't

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
carbon that are not sealed and I don't

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.710 
carbon that are not sealed and I don't
know<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.880> gonna<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.150> able<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> show<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
know if I'm gonna be able to show you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.780 
know if I'm gonna be able to show you
guys<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.500> camera<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.610> it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
guys here on my camera but it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.850 
guys here on my camera but it's
basically<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.329> raw<00:01:45.689> carbon<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.320> ends

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
basically just raw carbon on the ends

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.740 
basically just raw carbon on the ends
and<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.299> seal<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and what you want to do is just seal it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.929 
and what you want to do is just seal it
up<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.020> some<00:01:49.200> CA<00:01:49.439> glue<00:01:49.710> now<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.670> prep<00:01:51.180> my

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
up with some CA glue now I do prep my

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.219 
up with some CA glue now I do prep my
carbon<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.869> take<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
carbon and what I do is I just take a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.520 
carbon and what I do is I just take a
220<00:01:55.920> grit<00:01:56.130> sanding<00:01:56.790> sponge<00:01:57.119> lightly<00:01:57.869> sanded

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
220 grit sanding sponge lightly sanded

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.679 
220 grit sanding sponge lightly sanded
nothing<00:01:58.860> too<00:01:59.009> crazy<00:01:59.450> chamfer<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.479> edge

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
nothing too crazy chamfer the edge

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
nothing too crazy chamfer the edge
slightly<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> smooth

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
slightly and just kind of get it smooth

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.959 
slightly and just kind of get it smooth
down<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.329> very<00:02:04.130> even<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.369> next

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
down so it's all very even the next

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.850 
down so it's all very even the next
thing<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.479> take<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> black<00:02:07.229> sharpie<00:02:07.680> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
thing I do is I take a black sharpie and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.100 
thing I do is I take a black sharpie and
just<00:02:07.950> kind<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.000> seal<00:02:09.209> those<00:02:09.360> edges<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
just kind of seal those edges so that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.920 
just kind of seal those edges so that
the<00:02:10.289> CA<00:02:10.679> glue<00:02:10.979> which<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.520> step<00:02:11.760> three<00:02:12.150> doesn't

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the CA glue which is step three doesn't

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.460 
the CA glue which is step three doesn't
soak<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
soak in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.610 
soak in
too<00:02:13.590> much<00:02:13.910> pretty<00:02:14.910> much<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.270> use<00:02:15.510> Zappa<00:02:16.290> gap

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
too much pretty much I use Zappa gap

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.420 
too much pretty much I use Zappa gap
this<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.690> great<00:02:18.690> tire<00:02:19.410> glue<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.310> I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
this is just a great tire glue that I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.910 
this is just a great tire glue that I
use<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.700> force<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.150> medium<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.780> then<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.680> just

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
use to force the medium and then I just

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.890 
use to force the medium and then I just
take<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.400> straight<00:02:23.940> edge<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.570> want<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
take a straight edge that you want to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.720 
take a straight edge that you want to
basically<00:02:25.230> discard<00:02:25.890> afterwards<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.610> you'll

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
basically discard afterwards and you'll

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.450 
basically discard afterwards and you'll
see<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.090> kind<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.360> black<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.900> there<00:02:28.130> from<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
see that kind of black on there from the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.100 
see that kind of black on there from the
sharpie<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.060> kind<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.300> bleeds<00:02:30.660> out<00:02:30.810> with<00:02:31.080> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
sharpie that kind of bleeds out with a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.900 
sharpie that kind of bleeds out with a
CA<00:02:31.440> glue<00:02:32.060> when<00:02:33.060> over<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.080> good<00:02:34.700> as<00:02:35.700> far

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
CA glue when over it all is good as far

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.000 
CA glue when over it all is good as far
as<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> way<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.390> looks<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> end<00:02:36.960> pen<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
as the way it looks in the end pen it

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
as the way it looks in the end pen it
does<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> gloss<00:02:38.730> look<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.660> can

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
does have a gloss look to it you can

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.500 
does have a gloss look to it you can
kind<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:40.560> reflecting<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.520> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
kind of see it there reflecting and it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.710 
kind of see it there reflecting and it
just<00:02:42.750> slightly<00:02:43.940> kind<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.090> seals<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.570> edge

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
just slightly kind of seals the edge

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.140 
just slightly kind of seals the edge
right<00:02:45.990> there<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.580> were<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.850> hit<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
right there so if you were to hit it

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.710 
right there so if you were to hit it
pretty<00:02:48.240> hard

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
pretty hard

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.830 
pretty hard
it<00:02:48.900> will<00:02:49.380> protect<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:49.920> slightly<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.840> carbon

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
it will protect this slightly so carbon

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.580 
it will protect this slightly so carbon
can<00:02:52.530> start<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.400> shatter<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.270> fray<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.320> I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
can start to shatter and fray but I

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.270 
can start to shatter and fray but I
think<00:02:56.010> doing<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.940> step<00:02:57.180> definitely<00:02:57.930> helps

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
think doing this step definitely helps

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.040 
think doing this step definitely helps
as<00:02:59.280> far<00:02:59.580> as<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> parts<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.570> mean<00:03:00.720> awesome

well kind of a stupid little thing that
I<00:04:07.650> did<00:04:07.860> here<00:04:08.160> especially<00:04:08.760> when<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.239> saw<00:04:09.480> how

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720

small those diff balls were this is

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.210 
small those diff balls were this is
basically<00:04:15.269> just<00:04:15.420> foam<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.500> gave<00:04:16.739> up<00:04:16.919> at

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
basically just foam that you gave up at

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.190 
basically just foam that you gave up at
the<00:04:17.340> hardware<00:04:17.519> store<00:04:18.080> quarter-inch<00:04:19.080> thick

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
the hardware store quarter-inch thick

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.339 
the hardware store quarter-inch thick
and<00:04:19.830> it's<00:04:20.549> used<00:04:20.820> for<00:04:20.880> underneath<00:04:21.539> like<00:04:21.780> tables

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
and it's used for underneath like tables

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.409 
and it's used for underneath like tables
and<00:04:22.680> chairs<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.099> whatnot<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.880> prevent<00:04:24.270> them

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
and chairs and whatnot to prevent them

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.040

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
I just cut little core

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.970 
I just cut little core
pieces<00:04:27.670> right<00:04:27.790> here<00:04:28.060> as<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.180> see<00:04:28.830> stuck<00:04:29.830> it

pieces right here as you see stuck it

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.940 
pieces right here as you see stuck it
down<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.430> table<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.590> that's<00:04:32.590> kind<00:04:32.860> of

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
down to the table and that's kind of

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.320 
down to the table and that's kind of
like<00:04:33.070> where<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.280> keep<00:04:33.490> all<00:04:33.640> my<00:04:33.700> little<00:04:33.940> parts
