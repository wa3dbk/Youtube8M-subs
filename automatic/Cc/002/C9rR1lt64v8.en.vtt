00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.980
 3 years ago 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.529
 Only once a year 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.409
 I entered Nomura 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
 Then it occurred 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:24.820

 First of all, I will say something like this of Fukui 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 There is framing 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 Anyway 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.020
 It seems like the first year 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.020
 That's the best memory for Japan 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 It is only expensive 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 It is strange this time 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.860
 The last Felipe Massa 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 Such Yuka Murata 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.869

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.059

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.679
 Ei Sasayama 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.109
 I'm thinking as if I'm very interested and smile 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:20.769
 Was 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.999
 But rena.pa 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.999

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.700
 Japan's First Person Bra Resume 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.039
 Even without a machine 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.039
 Very good 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.019
 This height and width for 13 people 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.349
 Really adopted 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.349
 I can see the body well 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
 It worked well so it looks like 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.989
 The end is good too smile is a smile 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.339

 Rie Hasegawa had 342 cases 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.450
 Bernard the culprit lost 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.569
 It is unusual to have at the time of the broad sense 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.260
 Usually I did 18th in Athens personally 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.099
 As a leading person in Japan who was 15th in World Championships last year 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.849
