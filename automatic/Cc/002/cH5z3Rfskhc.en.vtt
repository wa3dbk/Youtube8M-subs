00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.409 

I<00:00:00.530> saw<00:00:01.530> that<00:00:01.680> you<00:00:01.829> needed<00:00:02.129> help<00:00:02.280> with<00:00:03.179> the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
I saw that you needed help with the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.190 
I saw that you needed help with the
setup<00:00:03.629> for<00:00:04.290> your<00:00:05.210> camcorder<00:00:06.210> video<00:00:06.990> game

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
setup for your camcorder video game

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.709 
setup for your camcorder video game
capture<00:00:08.809> I've<00:00:09.809> done<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.800> really<00:00:11.190> does<00:00:11.429> work

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
capture I've done it it really does work

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.169 
capture I've done it it really does work
and<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.990> was<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> record<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.190> how<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.969> do

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
and I was going to record it how to do

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.570 
and I was going to record it how to do
it<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.929> ended<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.260> being<00:00:16.590> confused

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
it but I just ended up being confused

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700 
it but I just ended up being confused
and<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.600> better<00:00:18.900> off<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.439> just

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and so I think it's better off if I just

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.330 
and so I think it's better off if I just
drew<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.220> instructions<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.949> so<00:00:22.949> here<00:00:23.250> we

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
drew out instructions for you so here we

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460
