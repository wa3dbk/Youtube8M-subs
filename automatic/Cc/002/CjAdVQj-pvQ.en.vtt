00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.340
 Four 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.790
 Another common yeah or would have been Yes how is about three pattern contains pitch bit Tashiro 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.310
 I do not do anything but enter 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.520
 Super is great 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.760
 Urudora one body something smoked like a love game 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.720
 Wow say something like so okay to raise more and more pitch 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:17.609
 Volume is also great in that, yet that the have stable 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.459
 The rubber later this in there firmly important out there say skirt use another Vidro is 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.330
 I think I'm already so happy-I think 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.100
 Especially in Bokudo again 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:31.400
 And this about 24 a little bit 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:36.820
 Recommend and since that great are lifting the synthesis with a Well hard shell is it that the heat of 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.820
 Even if the high pitch in a well-balanced manner 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.449
 I thought I would not miss the shape of the head 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:49.039
 I also said that the edge is 45 degrees so ugly beautifully Stone 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.200
 The feeling was good at feeling the pitch to great smooth to say to that tuning is increased 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.250
 is not it 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.639

 I think that especially glad that's the character of this smear to true I'm 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:17.070
 Such a feeling and one point in the end As a place where it is easy to understand if you look at a 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.670
 It's here, but I wonder if I 'm playing with an adjustment here with adjustment 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.550

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.840

 A screw is reprinted and Katsuta is as it is with p8 bare hands 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.919
 As we can take off part of snap, it is a little mind when we change head on snare side 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.390
 I recommend you 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:56.240

 In a hurry in the fact that it is possible to dispense the need fewer such a place in the challenge of the 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:06.130
 By also say that I think that a great and easy when you're 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:08.830
