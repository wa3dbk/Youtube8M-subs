00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.460
 easy hairstyles to go to school 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.480
 in the first action we will take the 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.490
 hair from the top part and what 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.620
 we will divide into three partitions for 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.620
 make a braid of three root ropes 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.539
 we can cross the braid on the outside to 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.220
 leave it flatter or cross it inside 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.220
 to leave it more marked 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 when we have braided all the part of 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.130
 up with a rubber tie the braid 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.130
 we take a lock we wind two fingers 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.380
 and we passed the hair between the two fingers 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.090
 to cover the rubber with a fork what 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.090
 we hold and ready 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.640
 What we can also do is catch 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.360
 a rubber band and make a second ponytail with 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.360
 all the hair 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.590
 we take a lock and cover the rubber 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.780
 with a fork we hold them and ready 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.560
 in the third option we take all the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.200
 top of the hair we comb it 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.200
 with your hands and we make a pigtail 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.790
 we take all the hair that we have left 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.240
 loose and we roll it up to make a 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.240
 monkey 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.569
 we roll up the ends we take it from 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.200
 down we were and with hairpins what 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.200
 we hold 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.070
 and ready 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.070
 two 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.950
 in the last option we take all the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.020
 part of the hair side we comb it and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.750
 with one like a clamp we separate them 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.520
 so that it does not bother us 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.100
 we take the whole back and we do 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.080
 a pigtail next to it and with the strand that 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.210
 we have separated before we started doing 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.190
 a three-strand braid from there 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.530
 let's add hair only when 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.720
 we cross inside when we cross by 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.290
 outside we do it normal inside 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.210
 we add and out normal we add by 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 inside and when we do it outside 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.900
 we cross normal and we do the same in 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.900
 each crossing 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.140
 we roll up from the tip what 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.810
 we tie with a small rubber and we take 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.170
 the braid and wrap it up 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.170
 rubber 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.000
 with forks we hold them and already what 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.000
 we will have ready 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.420
