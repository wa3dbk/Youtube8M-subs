00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.698
 Greetings, nefalem, and welcome to patch 2.1.0. 

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:31.794
 I'm Camel Brandy, also known as Nevalistis, 

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:35.336
 representative of the Diablo III community and your hostess today. 

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:38.792
 In this video we will explore the first big content patch 

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.828
 of Reaper of Souls. Let us begin. 

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:49.060
 The great novelty is the Seasons, a new competitive system. 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.672
 They are similar to the scales of Diablo 2, 

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:56.193
 and offer heroes the opportunity to play with new characters from level 1. 

00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:59.549
 The Seasons are practically an independent game mode. 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.489
 For that reason, the characters of Season will have their own chest, 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.765
 Progress of artisans, gold and Paragon levels. 

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:09.822
 Season characters can be Normal or Extreme. 

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:12.294
 Let's see the season rewards. 

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:16.712
 Each season will bring many new legendary objects, 

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:19.873
 and the season characters can try them first. 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.766
 If the Seasons are not your thing, do not despair. 

00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:25.548
 At the end of each Season, these objects will go into normal mode, 

00:01:25.558 --> 00:01:27.497
 so that everyone can find them. 

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:31.243
 Each Season, the participants will also get a piece 

00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:33.821
 of a new and exclusive transfiguration set. 

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:37.119
 Each Season you play will reward you with a new piece. 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.956
 So join the fun and get ready to demonstrate everything you can do. 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.865
 The Conquests are exclusive achievements that represent a variety of challenges, 

00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:47.976
 from defeating Maltael in Torment VI 

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:51.189
 until completing the entire campaign in less than an hour. 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.784
 The conquests are available for Normal and Extreme heroes, 

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:58.087
 so you can face these challenges in the game mode you prefer. 

00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:01.836
 When complete you earn points of achievement that add up to your Season total. 

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.925
 A record of the first positions will also be kept 

00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:06.135
 in the regional table of positions. 

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:09.379
 The first thousand to finish a Conquest will be immortalized 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.118
 in the table of that Season. 

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:15.201
 At the end of a Season, your Season characters 

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.508
 they will go to the Common or Normal mode as appropriate. 

00:02:18.508 --> 00:02:24.114
 The rewards that you have obtained: objects, gold, artisan formulas, 

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:28.010
 Paragon experience and achievements will also go along with your character. 

00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:31.492
 The objects of your season chest will arrive by mail. 

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:38.948
 Another new function is the Superior fissures, 

00:02:38.948 --> 00:02:43.304
 a competitive form of Fissures nefalem with a progress timer. 

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:46.628
 You will have fifteen minutes to defeat the Guardian of the fissure, 

00:02:46.628 --> 00:02:49.168
 and the best times will have better rewards. 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.520
 To enter a Superior Fissure you first need: 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.222
 get a Stony Sphere from a Keeper's tests of the normal fissure 

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:57.889
 and use the obelisk nefalem of the town to enter the Kingdom of evidence. 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.736
 The Kingdom is a small arena designed to assess your ability 

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:03.447
 to defeat waves of enemies. 

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:05.610
 When you complete this test, you will receive 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.874
 a stony sphere superior according to your level. 

00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:09.720
 To open a superior crack 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.161
 take your Stone Sphere superior to the obelisk nefalem of the town. 

00:03:16.187 --> 00:03:18.085
 In the upper Crack you will see a progress bar 

00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:21.333
 with the deaths of monsters and the remaining time. 

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:25.115
 Monsters give progress according to their health and difficulty level: 

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:27.261
 the flocks of champions and elite 

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:29.384
 They will increase your progress faster than normal henchmen. 

00:03:29.384 --> 00:03:32.112
 The monsters of these Fissures do not leave booty. 

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.891
 All the rewards of the Superior Fissure are achieved 

00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:37.056
 by killing the Keeper of the fissure. 

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:42.090
 These Fissures are very difficult and require strategy. 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.422
 When you enter one, keep these rules in mind: 

00:03:45.422 --> 00:03:48.495
 Some resurrection and teleportation functions are disabled. 

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.959
 It is also not allowed to change equipment or skills 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.823
 within a superior Fissure, so plan ahead. 

00:03:54.823 --> 00:04:00.453
 When you defeat the Guardian, you will meet Urshi, a new NPC. 

00:04:00.453 --> 00:04:03.522
 If you complete the upper Crack before the time runs out, 

00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:05.652
 You can choose between two rewards: 

00:04:05.652 --> 00:04:08.812
 the ability to add a range to one of your legendary gems 

00:04:08.812 --> 00:04:12.237
 or a higher level stony sphere. 

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:14.995
 If the fissure time is over, 

00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:17.401
 the Fissure Guardian will appear automatically. 

00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:22.090
 Although you will not be able to continue advancing within the Superior Fissure 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.287
 after defeating the Guardian, 

00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:27.419
 yes you can improve one of your legendary gems, 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.650
 which allows to add several ranges in higher fissures of higher level. 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.795
 Show what you are made of and you will be well rewarded! 

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:43.118
 The Seasons and the Superior Fissures will have their own standings. 

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:45.864
 Here players can track their progress. 

00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:50.514
 There are tables for Superior Cracks, Achievement Points and Seasonal Conquests. 

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:53.158
 Its informative and detailed design 

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:57.038
 allows you to compare your progress with that of your region, 

00:04:57.038 --> 00:04:58.986
 your friends and the members of your clan. 

00:04:58.986 --> 00:05:02.128
 The progress of each table has its particularities. 

00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:07.367
 The Upper Cracks table shows the Normal and Extreme heroes, 

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:10.319
 whether they are seasonal or in the normal way. 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.554
 They can also be ordered according to the composition of the group: 

00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:20.160
 solitary game for each class, and groups of two, three or four players. 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.509
 As the points of achievements and achievements are exclusive of the seasons, 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.356
 in those tables only information of the characters of Season is recorded. 

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:31.142
 In any case, this information applies to the entire account, 

00:05:31.142 --> 00:05:34.556
 so even if some challenges must be played in a particular way, 

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:37.863
 there is no need to separate them between Normal and Extreme modes. 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.210
 In patch 2.1.0, many objects have been modified 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.666
 but we would like to concentrate on some of them. 

00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:52.622
 The base damage of two-handed weapons has generally increased. 

00:05:52.622 --> 00:05:56.792
 This change is retroactive, and the two-handed weapons that you already have 

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:58.884
 they will be updated automatically. 

00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:02.654
 We have added unique powers to several existing legendary objects. 

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:06.925
 Your old legendary objects will not benefit from this change, 

00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:09.344
 so do not hesitate to throw them away. 

00:06:14.568 --> 00:06:17.887
 Have you ever wondered what is behind the portal of a Treasure Goblin? 

00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:19.422
 The answer is here! 

00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:22.412
 With patch 2.1.0, if you defeat a Treasure Goblin, 

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:25.296
 it is possible to leave a portal open to the vault, 

00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:28.579
 a mystical area with new and dangerous enemies, 

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:32.172
 and unimaginable riches. Do not let them escape! 

00:06:32.172 --> 00:06:35.876
 We also have a new environment in the nefalem Fissures: 

00:06:35.876 --> 00:06:37.012
 the Sumidero. 

00:06:37.012 --> 00:06:40.651
 Originally, they were the sewers of La Marca del Oeste, 

00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:44.088
 but we could not include it in Act V for the launch of Reaper of Souls. 

00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:47.564
 Now you can explore this cold and stinky environment 

00:06:47.564 --> 00:06:50.189
 in any Fissure, superior or normal. 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.674
 This concludes our presentation of patch 2.1.0. 

00:06:54.674 --> 00:06:57.104
 Although we have already seen some of the main functions, 

00:06:57.104 --> 00:07:00.607
 There is much more to discover in the patch notes. Check them out! 

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:03.490
 Do not forget to share your opinions on the update 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.590
 in the Diablo III forums and prepare your team for the first season. 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.546
 Thanks for your time. See you in Sanctuary!
