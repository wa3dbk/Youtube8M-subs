of rotate that around I kind of see how
much<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.120> comes<00:02:07.300> in<00:02:07.659> which<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.890> kind<00:02:09.250> of

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
much it comes in which really kind of

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.619 
much it comes in which really kind of
sucks<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.750> what<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.500> need<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.510> get<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
sucks so what I need to do is get the

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.410 
sucks so what I need to do is get the
lens<00:02:13.840> off<00:02:14.109> and<00:02:14.319> then<00:02:14.409> see<00:02:14.590> if<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.769> can<00:02:14.920> pry<00:02:15.099> this

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
lens off and then see if I can pry this

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.640 
lens off and then see if I can pry this
rig<00:02:16.420> off<00:02:16.629> without<00:02:17.079> damage

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
rig off without damage

but what other choice do you have here
unless<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.540> want<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.780> pay<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.290> money<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.860> send

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
unless you want to pay the money to send

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.390 
unless you want to pay the money to send
it<00:02:27.849> in<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.269> that<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:29.290> take<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> choice

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
it in so that the take a choice

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.089 
it in so that the take a choice
take<00:02:30.549> a<00:02:30.579> chance<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:32.170> what<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.650> want<00:02:32.829> to<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:32.980> and

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
take a chance so what I want to do and

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.349 
take a chance so what I want to do and
kind<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.400> pick<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> good<00:02:33.939> spot<00:02:34.000> here<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:36.180> use<00:02:37.180> a

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
kind of pick a good spot here and use a

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.259 
kind of pick a good spot here and use a
little<00:02:38.010> watch<00:02:39.010> screwdriver<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:40.000> one<00:02:40.180> of

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
little watch screwdriver like one of

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.539 
little watch screwdriver like one of
little<00:02:40.420> thin<00:02:40.659> ones<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.680> see<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.189> can<00:02:42.340> get

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
little thin ones and see if I can get

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:50.119 
little thin ones and see if I can get
under<00:02:42.849> here<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:45.870> really<00:02:46.870> kind<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:48.239> get<00:02:49.239> that

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
under here and really kind of get that

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:57.699 
under here and really kind of get that
ring<00:02:51.129> out

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:06.339 

so<00:02:58.310> it's<00:02:58.519> a<00:02:58.609> lot<00:02:59.709> harder<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:03.310> do<00:03:05.170> then<00:03:06.170> what

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
so it's a lot harder to do then what

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.880 
so it's a lot harder to do then what
they<00:03:06.530> made<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:06.799> seem<00:03:08.079> as<00:03:09.079> far<00:03:09.349> as<00:03:09.439> this<00:03:09.560> little

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
they made it seem as far as this little

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:22.599 
they made it seem as far as this little
retainer<00:03:10.989> part<00:03:20.920> see<00:03:21.920> if<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.069> could<00:03:22.219> dig<00:03:22.459> in

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
retainer part see if I could dig in

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.660 
retainer part see if I could dig in
another<00:03:22.849> spot<00:03:23.209> here<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:27.829> looked<00:03:28.370> like<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.639> got

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
another spot here it looked like it got

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:41.409 
another spot here it looked like it got
under<00:03:29.030> there<00:03:33.879> this<00:03:34.879> is<00:03:35.060> terrifying<00:03:40.419> that

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
under there this is terrifying that

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:50.020 
under there this is terrifying that
almost<00:03:42.019> had<00:03:42.169> you<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:49.310> just<00:03:49.669> launched<00:03:49.939> it

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
almost had you and just launched it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.720 
almost had you and just launched it
across<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.419> room<00:03:50.629> sweet<00:03:55.900> there's<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.109> lens

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
across the room sweet there's the lens

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.479 
across the room sweet there's the lens
that<00:03:59.079> part<00:04:00.079> was<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.260> little<00:04:00.349> bit<00:04:00.530> easier<00:04:00.829> so

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.280 

what<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.519> forgot<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:04.970> do<00:04:05.359> is<00:04:05.599> get<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:05.810> cloth

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
what I forgot to do is get a cloth

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.399 
what I forgot to do is get a cloth
because<00:04:07.599> before<00:04:08.599> I<00:04:08.629> start<00:04:08.959> getting<00:04:09.290> that

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
because before I start getting that

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.069 
because before I start getting that
these<00:04:09.650> with<00:04:09.889> the<00:04:09.979> pliers<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.840> need<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.959> get

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
these with the pliers I need to get

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.229 
these with the pliers I need to get
something<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:13.810> protect<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:15.199> lens<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.459> let<00:04:17.150> me

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
something to protect that lens so let me

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:46.260 
something to protect that lens so let me
get<00:04:17.359> one<00:04:17.510> real<00:04:17.720> quick

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.090 

to<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.420> that<00:04:47.720> does<00:04:47.990> not<00:04:48.230> seem<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.680> want<00:04:49.010> to

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
to this that does not seem to want to

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.060 
to this that does not seem to want to
move<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:51.380> see<00:04:52.130> if<00:04:52.220> I<00:04:52.280> get<00:04:52.400> some<00:04:52.460> vice<00:04:52.730> grips<00:04:54.070> see

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
move so see if I get some vice grips see

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.750 
move so see if I get some vice grips see
if<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:55.310> might<00:04:55.490> help<00:04:55.640> but<00:04:57.490> outside<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.550> that

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
if that might help but outside of that

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.570 
if that might help but outside of that
we<00:04:58.940> might<00:04:59.120> try<00:04:59.360> another<00:04:59.540> technique<00:04:59.990> so<00:05:00.980> let's

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
we might try another technique so let's

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:15.070 
we might try another technique so let's
see<00:05:01.700> what<00:05:01.820> else<00:05:01.940> we<00:05:02.090> could<00:05:02.210> do<00:05:02.360> here

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:06:13.080 

Oh

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:37.140 

Oh<00:06:34.950> looks<00:06:35.950> like<00:06:36.010> it<00:06:36.220> starting<00:06:36.490> on<00:06:36.580> screw<00:06:36.910> here

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
Oh looks like it starting on screw here

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:52.409 
Oh looks like it starting on screw here
oh<00:06:42.150> all<00:06:43.150> right<00:06:44.520> whoo<00:06:45.520> oh<00:06:48.360> okay<00:06:49.360> so<00:06:50.080> I<00:06:51.419> was

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
oh all right whoo oh okay so I was

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.240 
oh all right whoo oh okay so I was
really<00:06:52.810> actually<00:06:53.020> I<00:06:53.470> actually<00:06:53.800> thought<00:06:54.190> that

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
really actually I actually thought that

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.740 
really actually I actually thought that
I'd<00:06:54.460> damaged<00:06:54.880> uh<00:06:55.050> the<00:06:56.050> camera<00:06:56.320> lens<00:06:56.650> and<00:06:57.010> I<00:06:57.750> was

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
I'd damaged uh the camera lens and I was

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.950 
I'd damaged uh the camera lens and I was
not<00:06:58.960> going<00:06:59.169> to<00:06:59.229> be<00:06:59.380> able<00:06:59.590> to<00:07:00.060> continue<00:07:01.060> or

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
not going to be able to continue or

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.560 
not going to be able to continue or
without<00:07:02.910> being<00:07:03.910> able<00:07:04.000> to<00:07:04.120> send<00:07:04.330> it<00:07:04.450> in<00:07:04.540> for

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
without being able to send it in for

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.290 
without being able to send it in for
repair<00:07:04.780> but<00:07:05.460> that<00:07:06.460> we<00:07:06.639> get<00:07:06.790> that<00:07:07.000> looks<00:07:07.210> like

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
repair but that we get that looks like

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.430 
repair but that we get that looks like
we're<00:07:07.479> actually<00:07:07.630> separating<00:07:08.260> the<00:07:08.380> actual

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
we're actually separating the actual

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.800 
we're actually separating the actual
filter<00:07:11.440> from<00:07:12.010> the<00:07:12.070> from<00:07:13.060> its<00:07:13.210> actual<00:07:13.600> own

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
filter from the from its actual own

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.560 
filter from the from its actual own
threading<00:07:14.410> so<00:07:14.770> I<00:07:15.040> guess<00:07:15.850> it<00:07:16.000> was<00:07:16.180> kind<00:07:16.360> of<00:07:16.510> a

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
threading so I guess it was kind of a

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.770 
threading so I guess it was kind of a
little<00:07:16.960> bit<00:07:17.140> nerve-wracking

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
little bit nerve-wracking

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.260
