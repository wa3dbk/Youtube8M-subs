is our M our a minimum reception
altitude<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> lowest

crossing<00:01:16.170> altitude<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.220> an<00:01:17.310> image

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550

this<00:01:38.580> one's<00:01:38.789> a<00:01:38.849> little<00:01:38.940> bit<00:01:39.149> different

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
this one's a little bit different

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.279 
this one's a little bit different
because<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> lowest<00:01:42.270> altitude<00:01:42.690> to

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
because this is the lowest altitude to

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.130 
because this is the lowest altitude to
clear<00:01:43.619> obstacles<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.550> still<00:01:45.149> receive<00:01:45.539> vor
