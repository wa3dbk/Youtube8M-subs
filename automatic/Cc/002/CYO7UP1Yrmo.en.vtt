00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.020
 I like them here I covered him with him 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:05.790
 welcome to the first chapter of we 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
 spain in heaven 'I had enough 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.139
 time that I had promising them then 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.929
 this little series and well we started 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.959
 with chapter 1 good friends and I'm going 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.060
 to quickly pass a video of how they would come 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.800
 being the rhythms that I'm going to apply and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.390
 in this case I meet my friend 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 Ivan, I thank you for helping me in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.920
 this little video and well this 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.760
 video is going to be fast so and so 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.530
 I could go out 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.090
 obviously the video is acting on its own 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.009
 they say it looks very hard that he does not 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.719
 shoot weight and right now I'm going to 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 explain why I was left looking towards 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 here then I run if he killed him and then 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.530
 I was left looking there if it appears 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.100
 here points I will explain everything has a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.589
 why ok and good friends right now like 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.019
 I'm going to be detailed step by step 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.730
 only these are the little four 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.890
 of these that I am going to show you on the day of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 today or good I am maybe a little bit 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.309
 more but these are the remaining four 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.129
 key to be able to fully master 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.260
 on the map hey see once they leave 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.940
 by good step 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.250
 once you practice them and you can 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 apply with all the mini kate and well 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.030
 let's start 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 well then the first step well where 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 by killing the enemy obviously 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.240
 they will ask why I stay in this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.440
 little corner in what would be the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.540
 landing pointing to live or the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.880
 elevator as you want to say pointing 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.130
 with schnyder well it's because if I do not 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.830
 was left looking towards here the rest is going to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.310
 avoid you will be the one I was going to try 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.050
 give me this the matica product 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.659
 mind and I will force that always the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.680
 enemy appear down either the side 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.110
 right or left side but 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 always down and most of the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.500
 people, it is always customary to go up 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.259
 once the person goes by himself 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.990
 after the return and sitges continue without 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.360
 Respawn then you are going to come here to top and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.570
 you are going to be placed right in these beams 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.119
 so what and what am I looking towards 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.260
 close ram or towards mojo as they want 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.330
 to call 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.520
 and you stay looking here you are going to prohibit 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.500
 the sight of a distillate you are going to prohibit 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.080
 the rest even on the blue side and you're going to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.570
 even prohibit other side of what 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.190
 they would come being open ram so no 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.490
 let's force it to appear here in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.890
 network one and well then once 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.200
 appear there most people 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.370
 likewise it will go up once 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.330
 go up then you have to annihilate and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.130
 good clear if you want to continue with the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.800
 back then obviously you're going to go 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.660
 to the other side to follow the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.400
 rhythm you can not stay twice in 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.390
 the same time in a stopped because 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.670
 obviously it will not appear 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.520
 now if you stay looking towards opera 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.069
 based this gate of the opera rhythm 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.000
 the network and the blues so 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.240
 it will only be on the rock side and 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.560
 good in rap club and this because it's 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.540
 because the game has a small 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.550
 advantage and always behind your back is going to 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.010
 from the enemy 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.440
 that means it's nothing similar to 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.800
 hill or rich guaje and the three where 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.900
 you could apply and estanquillos that is a 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.430
 subtracted an instant from you 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.580
 you were watching the spam already appears there 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.740
 this game I do not feel that you always 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.240
 will try to give a small advantage to 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.860
 that they just killed is to say if you 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.190
 they just killed here, obviously not 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.900
 you are going to appear in the program so you 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.990
 they will send as far as they can from the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.330
 enemy and obviously at a point where 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.370
 he can not see you now 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.560
 this is practically with all the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.390
 maps always the rest will be your 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.819
 back if you just killed him 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.890
 or program obviously will not appear 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.350
 there and obviously when you kill him there 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.000
 the state will be on your back if you 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.650
 you 're watching if it's going to be in the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.720
 bottom part if you stay watching from 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.060
 this side because the rest will be of 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.190
 opposite side and not on this side always 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.350
 is going to be on the opposite side you have to 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.360
 have a bit of logic and good with a 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.640
 little practice you will realize 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.230
 that really is very easy and very 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.720
 easy to master all the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.790
 small tips however there are others 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.739
 types of spawn that you can give each 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.900
 who is obviously going to look for his for his 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.250
 own particular way of being the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.170
 remains because if we have opened 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.900
 memory 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.739
 in this case we are in born of 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.650
 Mormon as you want to call them friends 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.960
 really it does not matter though and 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.760
 how can they opt in this space 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.560
 I'm going to show I'm going to check the 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.510
 technique that will always appear your 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.780
 parents in this case my spartan being 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.510
 the back towards close and the red spartan 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.700
 is giving it to open and if I 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.270
 kill and keep walking me in front 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.160
 the enemy would appear in close so 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.720
 Well, I'm going to show you and good 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.880
 if the enemy sees that you are running 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.830
 under 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.870
 and see that you killed him with his enemy is going to 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.340
 look for the closest way to kill you and 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.350
 if he sees that you are below, he is going to 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.000
 run down so you only 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.320
 what you have to do is flip you and 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.510
 come back for him 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.100
 these are these are some little tips 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.540
 friends who can serve you well 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.750
 for a one day one I'm going to show you 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.340
 again the enemy of account that is 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.770
 dead and is watching your camera how 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.900
 It runs simple and you just showed up 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.700
 this side what I would do for logic is 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.980
 chase him to kill you if you want a 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.650
 revenge good and yet you get the 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.600
 can now apply friends again 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.760
 I'm going to show you a new good is the 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.040
 same shot however it is another way 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.840
 to do it in an easier way and as 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.450
 wrong who has to find their 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.640
 way that is how you should do it in this 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.620
 case you stay looking here and how are you 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.260
 where the back paul them then you go to 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.090
 be able to force the other one to appear 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.670
 side again you run towards the other 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.129
 side and you're going to force him to appear 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.679
 again 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.559
 let's see it from another point to 

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:48.419
 teach them very good friends we started 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:50.339
 obviously putting us on landing 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.050
 giving back to the risk though 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.119
 we want to do we have to stay 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.339
 crouching, pointing to the corner 

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:58.529
 well if we turn our backs obviously 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:01.589
 we're going to force the rhythm to be from 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.659
 the side of the opposite side where we are and 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:06.419
 As I tell you, it's much better 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.399
 apply it in this way because this way 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.949
 you have a form or rather you have a 

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:13.019
 step to climb on that goes to you 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.789
 help a lot and even enemies and 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.529
 then you can not reach true friends 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:19.259
 this has been all for this video this 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:21.959
 we liked the first chapter of 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.569
 ruiz we go to the best there are many more are 

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:26.729
 the few that I know however I will be 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.759
 uploading and updating the little by little 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.800
 on different maps and how they like them 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.319
 commented everyone has to look for the 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.809
 way of doing this since I gave them people 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.699
 to look for this ruiz pons look for the 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:41.489
 you find one another 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.589
 different from mine applying the same law 

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:46.139
 that I click that I say giving him the 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:49.610
 back to the rhythm and the number of the only and 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.610
 see you in the next video bay
