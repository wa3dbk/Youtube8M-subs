00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello my dear family good for today 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.160
 I bring you a nice craftsmanship very 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.650
 pretty very original and very delicious 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.119
 craft for this return to class if 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.400
 you thought I was not going to bring you 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.520
 crafts to return to class you can 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.660
 wrong today I bring you a pretty 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.850
 craft that grasp the idea of ​​the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.590
 diploma that I did for graduation if 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.780
 they want to know how to make that diploma of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 which I speak then in description 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.590
 I leave the link and well then also 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.870
 I came up with the idea because when I did 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.150
 that diploma there was a comment from a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.579
 girl who told me that instead of diploma 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.070
 for graduation and are some pens not 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.320
 I know if he talked about pen pencils or 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 pen but then there also gave me the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.090
 idea so good so today I bring you 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.850
 some beautiful and delicious pencils 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 sweet and good because these are then for 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.980
 give it to the teacher or to our 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.469
 classmates after class for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 break the ice just as it is said not to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.920
 so that they can see us with good 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.909
 not not all face as well as 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.549
 extraterrestrials and well the truth 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.350
 I loved the super idea I liked a lot 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.840
 the decoration what I did not like very much 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.020
 was the tip that I kind of did not give him the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 touch then of a pencil at the end not like that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.619
 That's good, I hope you know 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.020
 find a role that looks like here 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.719
 so like maderita type the truth I do not 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.209
 I found but you can 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.969
 as you can always change the 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.709
 not design and good if you want to know how 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.959
 make these beautiful pencils because I do not know 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:36.090
 lose this video where I will teach you 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.170
 how to do it and well what are we going to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 need is going to be of course a sweet 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 preferable that it be round in can 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 deal with those that are large or 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.909
 these that are tiny these are very 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.549
 they sell it per bag and they are 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.879
 super cheap this is xe petite and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.770
 this is the big one too the girl 

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:58.229

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.500
 he told me that he occupied a 15 are our 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.509
 candy for the tip can equally 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.369
 occupy it for the tips and if they are going to 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.149
 do great but I do not occupy it 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.190
 simply occupy paper in silver 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.900
 we are also going to occupy a tech or 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.329
 Any little thing that they want to put 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.930
 I also double-sided glue 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.880
 and glue in bar 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.020
 scissors 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.510
 and paper we are going to occupy pink paper for 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.980
 the silver foil rubber you can 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.290
 occupy any silver paper or 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 they can also occupy this aluminum 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.960
 that I take care of your kitchen 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.290
 two bits 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.420
 also let's go the war the sweet and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.240
 the main color that is going to be the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.130
 yellow to make our as the 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.260
 pencil not now what we 're going to do 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.390
 first let's give even we are 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.420
 occupying these little ones are going to grab 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.810
 a little tip and they're going to roll it up a lot 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.730
 until it looks good so it comes to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.610
 Chacarita and they will cut the excess 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.580
 there it went flying so that it does not do so much 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.270
 bulge the other side does not matter now 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.960
 let's start with the pink color 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.240
 let's measure what our measure 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.350
 our sweet cited and we are going to cut the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.680
 excess 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.770
 now we are going to put glue on 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.770
 bar 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.470
 let's put a little bit of glue 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.460
 in bar to this I'm grabbing the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.940
 Tablita so that it does not stain on me 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.630
 here my table now let's put him not 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.360
 let's paste it without it being like that 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.300
 from outside 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.300
 so that later he covers the paper 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.910
 that's how they look 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.120
 so that it covers the little paper inside now 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.830
 we go with the aluminum foil this 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.050
 I put 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.300
 double sided glue because with the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.360
 glue on bar as it does not stick very 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.360
 all right 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.020
 A) Yes 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.230
 let's turn it around like I'm 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.540
 doing the little one you are going to 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.780
 do the big one too if they get it to 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.780
 do 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.280
 and now let's paste the paper first 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.190
 aluminum down here try to paste a 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.080
 bit here to the sweet and the rest that 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.789
 on 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.789
 to make our point 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.130
 equally if we are going to hit very well 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.559
 and already the rest the tip we will leave 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:56.860
 to do what's left to do 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:59.279
 the tip now let's cover our 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.279
 pencil 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.940
 let's also see let's cut the 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.940
 surplus 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.610
 and we're going to put glue in bar 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.860
 all the piece of paper as well as I did 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.180
 this little guy like that I made the big one like this 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.180
 that there is no difference 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.419
 with what 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:45.759
 so now here we are going to shape the 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.759
 puntita 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:05.710
 If we already cut the excess, do not create 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.560
 so that's how it will stay if they see that 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.530
 it is very long still the tip then and 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.390
 so we have to stay served now 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.180
 simply because we are going to put 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.720
 our label or you can leave it like this 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.720
 our tec 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.310
