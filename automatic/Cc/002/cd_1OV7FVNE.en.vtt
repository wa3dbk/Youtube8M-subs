hey<00:00:05.310> it's<00:00:05.460> Allison<00:00:05.910> from<00:00:06.029> Mahalo<00:00:06.390> comm<00:00:06.899> and

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
hey it's Allison from Mahalo comm and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.360 
hey it's Allison from Mahalo comm and
today<00:00:07.560> we're<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.950> learn<00:00:08.069> how<00:00:08.130> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
today we're going to learn how to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.910 
today we're going to learn how to
rewrite<00:00:08.639> expanded<00:00:09.480> form<00:00:09.750> using<00:00:10.200> exponents

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
rewrite expanded form using exponents

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.070 
rewrite expanded form using exponents
now<00:00:11.580> we<00:00:11.639> learned<00:00:12.030> before<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.750> can<00:00:12.870> write

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
now we learned before that we can write

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.279 
now we learned before that we can write
a<00:00:13.110> number<00:00:13.559> like<00:00:13.740> 213<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.969> expanded<00:00:15.690> form<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
a number like 213 in expanded form and

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.580 
a number like 213 in expanded form and
it<00:00:16.470> looks<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:17.750> 213<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.900> equal<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.350> 2

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it looks like this 213 is equal to 2

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.849 
it looks like this 213 is equal to 2
times<00:00:20.369> 100<00:00:21.590> plus<00:00:22.590> 1<00:00:23.100> times<00:00:23.699> 10<00:00:25.010> plus<00:00:26.010> 3<00:00:26.490> times<00:00:26.880> 1

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
times 100 plus 1 times 10 plus 3 times 1

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.600 
times 100 plus 1 times 10 plus 3 times 1
now<00:00:28.859> instead<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.460> writing<00:00:29.730> 10<00:00:30.800> 101<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.399> can

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
now instead of writing 10 101 we can

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.630 
now instead of writing 10 101 we can
rewrite<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> using<00:00:33.570> exponents<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
rewrite this using exponents so this is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.470 
rewrite this using exponents so this is
equal<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.940> 2<00:00:36.300> times<00:00:36.989> 10<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.219> power<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.730> 2<00:00:38.969> we

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
equal to 2 times 10 to the power of 2 we

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.330 
equal to 2 times 10 to the power of 2 we
have<00:00:39.629> 2<00:00:39.809> zeros<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.680> exponent<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.190> 2

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
have 2 zeros so we have an exponent of 2

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.990 
have 2 zeros so we have an exponent of 2
and<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.750> equal<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.290> 1<00:00:43.530> times<00:00:43.980> 10<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and this is equal to 1 times 10 to the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.209 
and this is equal to 1 times 10 to the
power<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.450> 1<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:46.170> 10<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> power<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> 1

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
power of 1 because 10 to the power of 1

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.389 
power of 1 because 10 to the power of 1
is<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.670> equal<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.090> 10<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.860> equal<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
is just equal to 10 and this is equal to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
is just equal to 10 and this is equal to
3<00:00:50.820> times<00:00:51.780> 10<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:52.980> power<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.520> 0<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.629> 10

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
3 times 10 to the power of 0 because 10

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.410 
3 times 10 to the power of 0 because 10
to<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> power<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.800> 0<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.460> equal<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> 1<00:00:57.180> now

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
to the power of 0 is just equal to 1 now

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
to the power of 0 is just equal to 1 now
this<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:58.500> looks<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:59.070> starting

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this probably looks like we're starting

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
this probably looks like we're starting
with<00:00:59.550> something<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.180> simple<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> ending

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
with something really simple and ending

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080 
with something really simple and ending
up<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.140> something<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.670> complicated<00:01:02.670> but

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
up with something really complicated but

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060 
up with something really complicated but
this<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:04.229> helps<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> really

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this is actually helps you to really

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.770 
this is actually helps you to really
understand<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.880> our<00:01:05.909> numbering<00:01:06.360> system

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
understand how our numbering system

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.870 
understand how our numbering system
works<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> being<00:01:07.830> able<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.280> write<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> number

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
works and being able to write a number

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.170 
works and being able to write a number
like<00:01:09.150> 213<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.260> expanded<00:01:11.130> form<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.490> exponents

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
like 213 in expanded form with exponents

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.730 
like 213 in expanded form with exponents
lets<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> learn<00:01:12.900> how<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> use<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.619> like

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
lets you learn how to use things like

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
lets you learn how to use things like
scientific<00:01:14.430> notation<00:01:15.150> which<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.630> really

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
scientific notation which can be really

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
scientific notation which can be really
really<00:01:16.020> helpful<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.770> anytime<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.939> need<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
really helpful so anytime you need to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.929 
really helpful so anytime you need to
write<00:01:18.570> an<00:01:18.780> exponent<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> power<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.130> 10<00:01:20.400> just

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
write an exponent of a power of 10 just

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.960 
write an exponent of a power of 10 just
look<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:21.390> many<00:01:21.600> zeroes<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.700> 100<00:01:23.700> has

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
look at how many zeroes you have 100 has

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.550 
look at how many zeroes you have 100 has
2<00:01:24.270> zeroes<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.930> means<00:01:25.110> you're<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> get

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
2 zeroes that means you're going to get

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
2 zeroes that means you're going to get
10<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.070> an<00:01:26.189> exponent<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> 2<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
10 with an exponent of 2 if you have a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.740 
10 with an exponent of 2 if you have a
thousand<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:29.700> means<00:01:29.939> you'll<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.210> 10<00:01:30.509> with

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
thousand that means you'll get 10 with

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
thousand that means you'll get 10 with
an<00:01:30.869> exponent<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.380> 3<00:01:31.680> because<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.369> 3<00:01:32.670> zeros

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
an exponent of 3 because we have 3 zeros

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.620 
an exponent of 3 because we have 3 zeros
over<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.200> 10,000<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:36.420> means

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
over here if you have 10,000 that means

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
over here if you have 10,000 that means
you'll<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.810> 10<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> power<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> 4<00:01:38.490> because

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you'll have 10 to the power of 4 because

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.359 
you'll have 10 to the power of 4 because
you<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.150> 4<00:01:39.450> zeros<00:01:39.869> over<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.560> that's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you have 4 zeros over here and that's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.520 
you have 4 zeros over here and that's
how<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.030> rewrite<00:01:42.540> something<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.990> expanded
