00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
real straight but it's pretty close I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.050 
real straight but it's pretty close I
don't<00:02:24.680> think<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.739> pushed<00:02:26.010> out<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.550> bottoms

that was real important you know it's

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.729 
that was real important you know it's

the filter intensifying generator works
very<00:03:26.490> well<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.760> keep<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.300> pump<00:03:27.990> on<00:03:28.170> about<00:03:29.330> 24/7

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
very well I keep the pump on about 24/7

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.920 
very well I keep the pump on about 24/7
and<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:34.460> chlorine<00:03:35.460> generator<00:03:35.910> on<00:03:36.120> 10<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> 15

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and the chlorine generator on 10 to 15

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.790 
and the chlorine generator on 10 to 15
hours<00:03:36.990> ago<00:03:38.960> about<00:03:39.960> once<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.290> week<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.710> to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
hours ago about once a week I have to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.000 
hours ago about once a week I have to
add<00:03:40.920> some<00:03:41.250> bleach<00:03:41.580> half<00:03:42.060> gallon<00:03:42.570> or<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.950> to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
add some bleach half gallon or so is to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.800 
add some bleach half gallon or so is to
give<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.400> little<00:03:44.490> boost<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.210> otherwise<00:03:45.450> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
give it a little boost but otherwise the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.060 
give it a little boost but otherwise the
chlorine<00:03:46.050> generator<00:03:46.440> seems<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.770> keep<00:03:46.920> up

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
chlorine generator seems to keep up

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.040 
chlorine generator seems to keep up
pretty<00:03:47.280> well

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
pretty well

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.390 
pretty well
keeps<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.170> pH<00:03:49.440> kind<00:03:49.710> of<00:03:49.770> high<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.160> have<00:03:50.280> that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
keeps the pH kind of high so I have that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.660 
keeps the pH kind of high so I have that
acid<00:03:50.880> once<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.240> while<00:03:52.190> it's<00:03:53.190> another<00:03:53.400> gate

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
acid once in a while it's another gate

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.880 
acid once in a while it's another gate
over<00:03:53.940> here<00:03:57.050> bunch<00:03:58.050> of<00:03:58.200> stuff<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.410> lot<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.800> the
