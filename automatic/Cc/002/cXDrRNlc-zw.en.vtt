00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.820 

so<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.720> do<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.110> d-string<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.590> do<00:02:15.680> off

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
so you do it on the d-string you do off

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.290 
so you do it on the d-string you do off
the<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> string<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.370> then<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.910> hit<00:02:17.090> your

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
the a string and then you hit your

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.850 
the a string and then you hit your

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:35.010 

all<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:24.000> all<00:02:24.150> together

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.700 

and<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.860> next<00:02:36.070> parts<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.370> bit<00:02:36.520> tricky<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.710> don't

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
and the next parts a bit tricky I don't

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.440 
and the next parts a bit tricky I don't
know<00:02:38.860> what<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.250> I'll<00:02:39.520> say<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.060> right<00:02:40.090> now

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
know what it is I'll say that right now

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.070 
know what it is I'll say that right now
but<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:40.990> make<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:42.400> figure<00:02:43.080> using

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
but I make it up and I just figure using

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.860 
but I make it up and I just figure using
common<00:02:44.410> sense<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.950> IDI<00:02:45.550> Ed's<00:02:46.030> technique<00:02:46.570> I

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
common sense and IDI Ed's technique I

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.410 
common sense and IDI Ed's technique I
would<00:02:47.290> think<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.220> would<00:02:48.370> be<00:02:48.490> something<00:02:48.790> along

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
would think it would be something along

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.070 
would think it would be something along
these<00:02:49.600> lines

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
these lines

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.780 
these lines
basically<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.800> want<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.070> get<00:02:51.250> from<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.760> a

string does he got all that coming up

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:10.360 
string does he got all that coming up
and<00:02:59.830> so<00:02:59.950> I<00:02:59.980> think<00:03:00.280> he's<00:03:00.370> going

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.360 

on<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.510> a-string<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:12.050> use<00:03:12.260> your<00:03:12.530> your<00:03:13.040> zero

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
on the a-string you use your your zero

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.640 
on the a-string you use your your zero
your<00:03:13.700> open<00:03:13.940> string<00:03:14.210> 5<00:03:15.110> 7<00:03:15.500> 12<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:17.320> then<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.350> just

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
your open string 5 7 12 and then I just

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.160 

-<00:06:25.250> that<00:06:25.490> was<00:06:25.610> too<00:06:25.760> much<00:06:25.880> of<00:06:25.940> a<00:06:26.090> bend<00:06:26.300> it<00:06:26.900> was<00:06:27.020> too
