cases<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> had<00:01:04.250> two<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.369> three<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> these

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
cases and I had two or three of these

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.240 
cases and I had two or three of these
and<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> fits<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.780> well<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> iphone<00:01:07.890> 4s

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and it fits really well on the iphone 4s

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859 
and it fits really well on the iphone 4s
and<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.549> really<00:01:08.760> protects<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.330> from<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.840> sides

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and it really protects it from all sides

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
and it really protects it from all sides
and<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.439> does<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.189> look<00:01:11.400> half<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and it does not look half that if you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510 
and it does not look half that if you
ask<00:01:12.479> us<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:14.280> almost

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

reminds<00:01:14.880> us<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:16.110> eigen<00:01:16.500> background<00:01:16.950> so

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
reminds us of the eigen background so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.030 
reminds us of the eigen background so
definitely<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> best<00:01:19.590> covers<00:01:19.890> I've

spaced as well the only thing that I am
not<00:03:17.810> too<00:03:17.989> happy<00:03:18.139> about<00:03:18.319> is<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.799> fact<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.099> it

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
not too happy about is the fact that it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.120 
not too happy about is the fact that it
only<00:03:19.639> raises<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.359> little<00:03:21.049> bit<00:03:21.290> above<00:03:21.889> the

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.150 
display and a little bit above the back
panel<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.389> I<00:03:27.079> don't<00:03:27.380> think<00:03:27.500> that's<00:03:27.680> enough

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
panel and I don't think that's enough

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.659 
panel and I don't think that's enough
height<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.910> actually<00:03:29.480> protect<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.989> device<00:03:30.319> a

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
height to actually protect the device a

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.520 
height to actually protect the device a
little<00:03:31.669> bit<00:03:31.819> more<00:03:32.269> would<00:03:33.200> have<00:03:33.319> been

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
little bit more would have been

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.409 
little bit more would have been
appreciated<00:03:34.250> from<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.549> company<00:03:34.910> that's<00:03:35.209> called

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
appreciated from a company that's called

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.080 
appreciated from a company that's called
more<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.739> little<00:03:37.069> wider<00:03:37.489> would<00:03:37.819> have<00:03:37.940> been

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
more so a little wider would have been

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.819 
more so a little wider would have been
appreciated<00:03:38.690> but<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.079> believe<00:03:39.410> they<00:03:39.590> try<00:03:39.799> to

appreciated but I believe they try to

appreciated but I believe they try to
keep<00:03:40.099> it's<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.579> slim<00:03:41.000> profile<00:03:41.480> sort<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.140> cover

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
keep it's a slim profile sort of cover

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.900 
keep it's a slim profile sort of cover
it<00:03:43.160> does<00:03:43.400> not<00:03:43.550> let<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.420> device<00:03:44.750> touch<00:03:45.910> the

grip I feel that buttons are easy to
reach<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.660> shouldn't<00:03:59.660> be<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> problem<00:04:00.110> since

once seemed to go in without any
problems<00:04:22.550> all<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.060> way<00:04:23.150> through<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.720> it's

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
problems all the way through and it's

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
problems all the way through and it's
touching<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.590> surface<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.340> iphone<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.920> if

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
touching the surface of the iphone so if

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.400 
touching the surface of the iphone so if
it's<00:04:28.130> about<00:04:28.340> that<00:04:28.610> thick<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.660> should<00:04:29.900> work<00:04:30.140> but

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
it's about that thick it should work but

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.020 
it's about that thick it should work but
if<00:04:30.530> it's<00:04:30.680> any<00:04:30.860> thicker<00:04:31.160> than<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.790> might

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
if it's any thicker than that it might

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.420 
if it's any thicker than that it might
face<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:33.020> little<00:04:33.290> bit<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.590> problem<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.370> I'm

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.500 
face a little bit of problem and I'm
going<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.610> be<00:04:34.730> testing<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.060> out<00:04:35.180> with<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.420> couple

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
going to be testing it out with a couple

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.940 
going to be testing it out with a couple
of<00:04:35.690> headphones<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.320> checking<00:04:36.710> if<00:04:36.830> it's

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
of headphones and checking if it's

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.880 
of headphones and checking if it's
actually<00:04:37.250> working<00:04:37.640> just<00:04:38.000> fine<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:39.440> lock<00:04:39.620> is

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.370 
actually working just fine the lock is
actually<00:04:40.490> quite<00:04:40.640> robust<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.480> should<00:04:42.260> not

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
actually quite robust and should not

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.800 
actually quite robust and should not
come<00:04:42.590> off<00:04:42.770> very<00:04:43.190> easily<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:43.910> pretty<00:04:44.540> happy

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
come off very easily so pretty happy

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.159 
come off very easily so pretty happy
with<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.080> as<00:04:45.260> well<00:04:46.330> till<00:04:47.330> now<00:04:47.480> it<00:04:47.630> looks<00:04:47.780> good

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169

and<00:04:48.410> not<00:04:48.620> too<00:04:48.650> happy<00:04:48.890> about<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.310> fact<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:49.550> it

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
and not too happy about the fact that it

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.020 
and not too happy about the fact that it
doesn't<00:04:49.970> raise<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.510> lot<00:04:50.930> above<00:04:51.580> what<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.730> should

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
doesn't raise a lot above what it should

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.450 
doesn't raise a lot above what it should
