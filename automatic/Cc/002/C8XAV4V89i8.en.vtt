00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
or that might happen to be the case so I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.730 
or that might happen to be the case so I
just<00:01:52.790> want<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.000> throw<00:01:53.180> some<00:01:53.390> examples<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.050> some

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
