00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
to do it I just

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.460 
to do it I just
have<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.239> patience<00:02:10.689> anymore<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.260> did

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.440 
have the patience anymore that I did
when<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.650> first<00:02:11.709> started<00:02:12.099> out<00:02:12.489> obviously

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
when I first started out obviously

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.410 
when I first started out obviously
something<00:02:13.780> changed<00:02:14.140> along<00:02:14.379> the<00:02:14.560> way<00:02:15.420> so

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
something changed along the way so

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.910 
something changed along the way so
that's<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.659> reason<00:02:16.689> I've<00:02:16.989> stopped<00:02:17.230> editing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
that's the reason I've stopped editing

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
were for the project memory videos which

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.460 
were for the project memory videos which
would<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.150> highlighted<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.110> main

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
probably going to stick a pin in that

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.449

the<00:03:24.519> answer<00:03:24.819> is<00:03:25.419> no<00:03:26.199> is<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:27.220> possible<00:03:27.669> that<00:03:27.699> i

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
the answer is no is it possible that i

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.080 
the answer is no is it possible that i
could<00:03:27.879> do<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.449> future<00:03:28.569> perhaps<00:03:29.500> but

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
could do it in the future perhaps but

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.420 
could do it in the future perhaps but
nothing<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.180> set<00:03:31.389> in<00:03:31.419> stone<00:03:32.069> lastly<00:03:33.069> and<00:03:33.250> just

is anyone's guess now some I've been
asking<00:05:33.870> why<00:05:34.870> does<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.140> take<00:05:35.290> so<00:05:35.320> long<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.710> do

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
the only reason it takes long is because

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.460 
the only reason it takes long is because
the<00:05:41.740> conversations<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.550> record<00:05:43.470> the
