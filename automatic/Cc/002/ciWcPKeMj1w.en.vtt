still<00:01:55.079> people<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.329> mutated<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
still people there just like mutated in

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
still people there just like mutated in
people<00:01:59.009> whatever<00:01:59.549> they<00:01:59.969> did<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.240> determine

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
people whatever they did that determine

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.069 
people whatever they did that determine
and<00:02:02.180> yeah<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.509> at<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> end<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.049> don't

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079

pretty old now but yeah and like there's
one<00:03:29.880> part<00:03:30.090> where<00:03:30.150> Jake<00:03:30.330> turns<00:03:30.780> himself<00:03:30.989> into<00:03:31.290> a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
one part where Jake turns himself into a

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.220 
one part where Jake turns himself into a
couch<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.040> Finn<00:03:32.700> sits<00:03:32.940> down<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.360> says<00:03:33.840> it's

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
couch and Finn sits down and says it's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.740 
couch and Finn sits down and says it's
just<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.560> come<00:03:34.920> on<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.690> don't

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
just like come on like that and I don't

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.870 
just like come on like that and I don't
think<00:03:37.020> that<00:03:37.260> would<00:03:37.410> have<00:03:37.530> been<00:03:37.560> as<00:03:37.860> funny<00:03:38.160> if

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
think that would have been as funny if

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.340 
think that would have been as funny if
you<00:03:38.970> had<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.450> higher<00:03:39.600> pitched<00:03:39.930> voice<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.290> think

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
you had the higher pitched voice I think

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.260 
you had the higher pitched voice I think
the<00:03:40.590> PGS<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.250> was<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.550> good<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.000> it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
the PGS that was really good so it's

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.610 
the PGS that was really good so it's
it's<00:03:42.780> one<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.020> those<00:03:43.110> things<00:03:43.260> where<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:43.560> like

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
it's one of those things where it's like

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.750 
it's one of those things where it's like
because<00:03:43.860> that's<00:03:44.010> always<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.340> big<00:03:44.430> concern

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
because that's always the big concern

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.370 
because that's always the big concern
what's<00:03:44.970> gonna<00:03:45.060> happen<00:03:45.420> when<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.720> child<00:03:46.020> actor

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
what's gonna happen when the child actor

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.320 
what's gonna happen when the child actor
our<00:03:47.130> actors<00:03:47.459> grows<00:03:47.670> up<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.209> voice

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
our actors grows up and the voice

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.449 
our actors grows up and the voice
changes<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.050> stuff<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.530> uh<00:03:49.709> they<00:03:50.130> see<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
changes and stuff and uh they see the

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.660 
changes and stuff and uh they see the
work<00:03:50.640> with<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:50.970> pretty<00:03:51.090> well<00:03:51.360> yeah<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:52.670> thought

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
work with it pretty well yeah I thought

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.260 
work with it pretty well yeah I thought
it<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.150> fun<00:03:54.360> episode<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:56.150> wouldn't<00:03:57.150> say

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
it was just a fun episode I wouldn't say

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.670 
it was just a fun episode I wouldn't say
it's<00:03:57.390> one<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.720> really<00:03:57.840> got<00:03:58.080> me<00:03:58.200> hooked<00:03:58.350> right

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
it's one that really got me hooked right

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.180 
it's one that really got me hooked right
away<00:03:59.390> because<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.720> kind<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:01.200> was<00:04:01.380> guessing<00:04:01.860> that

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
away because I kind of was guessing that

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.820 
away because I kind of was guessing that
they<00:04:02.400> weren't<00:04:02.670> gonna<00:04:02.910> be<00:04:03.150> human<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.290> it's

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
they weren't gonna be human and it's

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.410 
they weren't gonna be human and it's
like<00:04:04.980> oh<00:04:05.130> damn<00:04:05.550> they're<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.180> kind<00:04:06.360> of

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
like oh damn they're not that kind of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.110

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
okay but what if the happening was right

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.000 
okay but what if the happening was right
and<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.510> plants<00:04:56.840> are<00:04:56.930> alive<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.620> trying<00:04:57.919> to

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
and the plants are alive and trying to

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.590 
and the plants are alive and trying to
kill<00:04:58.160> us<00:04:58.340> then<00:04:58.850> they're<00:04:59.000> doing<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.240> very<00:04:59.510> poor

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
kill us then they're doing a very poor

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.480 
kill us then they're doing a very poor
job<00:04:59.870> that's<00:05:00.530> true<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.860> think<00:05:00.979> they<00:05:01.250> can<00:05:01.400> do

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
job that's true I think they can do

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.700 
job that's true I think they can do
better<00:05:01.520> um<00:05:01.990> considering<00:05:02.990> all<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.290> venomous

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
better um considering all the venomous

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.550 
better um considering all the venomous
and<00:05:03.979> destructive<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:04.910> violence<00:05:05.900> that<00:05:06.110> plants

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
and destructive and violence that plants

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.440 
and destructive and violence that plants
could<00:05:06.710> possibly<00:05:07.190> cause<00:05:07.460> yeah<00:05:08.150> they're<00:05:08.360> pretty

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
could possibly cause yeah they're pretty

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.909 
could possibly cause yeah they're pretty
low<00:05:08.660> on<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.870> totem<00:05:08.900> pole<00:05:09.169> in<00:05:09.440> terms<00:05:09.650> of

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
low on the totem pole in terms of

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.330 
low on the totem pole in terms of
killing<00:05:10.460> people<00:05:10.490> yeah<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.539> mean<00:05:11.750> honestly<00:05:12.340> it's

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
killing people yeah I mean honestly it's

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.189 
killing people yeah I mean honestly it's
almost<00:05:13.490> like<00:05:13.760> Shyamalan<00:05:14.510> didn't<00:05:14.810> make<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:14.960> good

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
almost like Shyamalan didn't make a good

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:15.689 
almost like Shyamalan didn't make a good
movie

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
movie

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:22.690 
movie
did<00:05:16.699> he<00:05:16.789> ever<00:05:20.680> there's<00:05:21.680> that<00:05:21.860> one<00:05:22.100> where<00:05:22.370> Bruce
