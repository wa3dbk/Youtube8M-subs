00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.900 
Venus is almost the same size as planet
Earth<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.740> only<00:00:23.010> about<00:00:23.220> five<00:00:23.699> percent

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910

hundred and fifteen Earth days long you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.260 
hundred and fifteen Earth days long you
can<00:00:30.630> imagine<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.080> gets<00:00:31.380> pretty<00:00:31.679> hot<00:00:32.149> well<00:00:33.149> it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
can imagine that gets pretty hot well it

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.500 
can imagine that gets pretty hot well it
does<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.739> temperature<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.399> Venus<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:36.300> raise

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
does the temperature on Venus can raise

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
does the temperature on Venus can raise
up<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.079> four<00:00:37.410> hundred<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.040> sixty<00:00:38.550> four

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
up to four hundred and sixty four

up to four hundred and sixty four
degrees<00:00:39.300> Celsius<00:00:40.730> it<00:00:41.730> takes<00:00:42.030> Finas<00:00:42.480> two

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
degrees Celsius it takes Finas two

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
degrees Celsius it takes Finas two
hundred<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> twenty-five<00:00:44.070> days<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.969> rotate

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
hundred and twenty-five days to rotate

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.930 
hundred and twenty-five days to rotate
around<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.809> Sun<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:46.800> remember<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.550> takes

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
around the Sun now remember it takes

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.889 
around the Sun now remember it takes
Venus<00:00:49.160> 243<00:00:50.160> days<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.670> rotate<00:00:50.789> around<00:00:51.180> its<00:00:51.449> axis

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
Venus 243 days to rotate around its axis

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.670 
Venus 243 days to rotate around its axis
that<00:00:52.590> means<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.579> year<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.000> Venus<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.719> shorter

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that means one year for Venus is shorter

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.340 
that means one year for Venus is shorter
than<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.039> day<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.489> Venus<00:00:57.350> another

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
than one day for Venus another

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.200 
than one day for Venus another
interesting<00:00:58.920> fact<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.789> Venus

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
interesting fact about the way Venus

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.020 
interesting fact about the way Venus
spins<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.629> its<00:01:00.660> axis<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.340> spins<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
spins on its axis is it spins in the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
spins on its axis is it spins in the
opposite<00:01:03.510> direction<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.739> rest<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
opposite direction of the rest of the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.719 
opposite direction of the rest of the
planets

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
planets

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.750 
planets
so<00:01:06.270> while<00:01:06.510> Earth<00:01:06.750> spins<00:01:07.409> east<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.189> west

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so while Earth spins east to west

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
so while Earth spins east to west
Venus<00:01:09.479> spins<00:01:10.110> west<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.799> east<00:01:11.720> now<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
Venus spins west to east now the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
Venus spins west to east now the
brightest<00:01:13.290> thing<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> sky<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.340> on
