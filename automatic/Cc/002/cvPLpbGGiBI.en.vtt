double bicep here you'll see if you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.150 
double bicep here you'll see if you
watch<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.629> many<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.140> my<00:00:49.260> posing<00:00:49.649> videos<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
watch really many of my posing videos I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
watch really many of my posing videos I
kind<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> same<00:00:51.059> thing<00:00:51.300> every<00:00:52.020> single

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
kind of do the same thing every single

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.100 
kind of do the same thing every single
time<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:53.219> around<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> same<00:00:53.940> circle<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
time I go around in the same circle and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.420 
time I go around in the same circle and
I<00:00:55.260> guess<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:56.100> I've<00:00:56.160> gotten

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I guess this is just what I've gotten

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.049 
I guess this is just what I've gotten
comfortable<00:00:56.640> with

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
comfortable with

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
comfortable with
I<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> angle<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> greatest

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
I see the angle here is not the greatest

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.860 
I see the angle here is not the greatest
I<00:01:01.250> don't<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> tripod<00:01:02.940> currently<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
I don't have a tripod currently it's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.850 
I don't have a tripod currently it's
it's<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.530> kind<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
it's not with me and so I just kind of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
it's not with me and so I just kind of
leaned<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.610> camera<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.090> against<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.600> TV<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
leaned my camera up against my TV and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
leaned my camera up against my TV and
hoped<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.770> aiming<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.189> me<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:12.060> my

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
hoped it was aiming at me because my

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.420 
hoped it was aiming at me because my
camcorder<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:13.200> also<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> greatest<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
camcorder is also not the greatest I

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.330 
camcorder is also not the greatest I
have<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> kodak<00:01:14.880> zi8<00:01:15.860> which<00:01:16.860> basically<00:01:17.189> just

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
have a kodak zi8 which basically just

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
have a kodak zi8 which basically just
doesn't<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.970> any<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.780> flip<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.200> it's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
doesn't have any kind of flip out it's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.070 
doesn't have any kind of flip out it's
one<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> those<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:20.330> handy<00:01:21.330> cam<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
one of those little handy cam kind of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.070 
one of those little handy cam kind of
looking<00:01:22.350> ones<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.570> handy<00:01:24.810> cam<00:01:24.960> with

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
looking ones that are not handy cam with

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.830 
looking ones that are not handy cam with
one<00:01:25.290> saw<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.270> flipped<00:01:27.270> looking<00:01:27.630> ones

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
one saw one of the flipped looking ones

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.520 
one saw one of the flipped looking ones
like<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.920> looks<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.520> flips<00:01:29.759> so

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
like it looks like one of the flips so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
like it looks like one of the flips so
basically<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.860> can't<00:01:32.700> ever<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.420> I'm

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
basically I can't ever see if I'm

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
basically I can't ever see if I'm
filming<00:01:33.960> myself<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.740> aimed<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.070> me<00:01:35.220> or

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
filming myself or if it's aimed at me or

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800 
filming myself or if it's aimed at me or
whatever<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.060> sometimes<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.540> means<00:01:36.659> after

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
whatever so sometimes that means after

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
whatever so sometimes that means after
refilling<00:01:37.229> things<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.220> particular<00:01:38.369> case

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
refilling things in this particular case

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
refilling things in this particular case
it<00:01:39.090> meant<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> did<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:40.020> legs<00:01:40.229> at

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it meant that you did not see my legs at

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.380 
it meant that you did not see my legs at
all<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.579> quite<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> didn't

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
all and for quite a bit of it you didn't

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
all and for quite a bit of it you didn't
really<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.689> my<00:01:42.810> core<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.409> much<00:01:43.790> and

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
but you don't see the traps pop with it

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.170 
but you don't see the traps pop with it
so<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.890> like<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.460> get<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.700> see<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.910> core

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
so I like that you get to see the core

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.120 
so I like that you get to see the core
with<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.350> get<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.620> see<00:03:33.800> everything

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
with it and you get to see everything

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.970 
with it and you get to see everything
else<00:03:34.250> with<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:36.200> doesn't<00:03:36.230> stretch<00:03:36.770> up

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
else with it and it doesn't stretch up

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.530 
else with it and it doesn't stretch up
my<00:03:37.070> chest<00:03:37.340> too<00:03:37.490> much<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:37.880> get<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.030> good<00:03:38.180> flex<00:03:38.330> on

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
my chest too much so get a good flex on

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.170 
my chest too much so get a good flex on
the<00:03:38.600> chest<00:03:38.900> but<00:03:39.770> really<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.460> do<00:03:40.640> not<00:03:40.820> see<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
the chest but really you do not see the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.260 
the chest but really you do not see the
traps<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.070> some<00:03:43.340> people<00:03:43.370> will<00:03:43.850> say<00:03:44.060> oh<00:03:44.090> you

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
traps and so some people will say oh you

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.990 
traps and so some people will say oh you
have<00:03:44.540> bad<00:03:44.959> traps<00:03:45.290> or<00:03:45.560> whatever<00:03:45.880> because<00:03:46.880> that

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
have bad traps or whatever because that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.880 
have bad traps or whatever because that
specific<00:03:47.360> pose<00:03:47.540> doesn't<00:03:47.900> really<00:03:48.050> accentuate

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
specific pose doesn't really accentuate

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.970 
specific pose doesn't really accentuate
the<00:03:49.070> traps<00:03:49.340> very<00:03:49.670> well<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.990> that's<00:03:51.770> why<00:03:51.950> I
