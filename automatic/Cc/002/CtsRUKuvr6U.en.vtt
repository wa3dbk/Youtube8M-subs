00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 two program big sport we work 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 for you to live there we write out their shackles 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.870
 and my colleague Taras Tymoshenko today 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.300
 let's talk about our Paralympic 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.980
 successes in the biathlon world cup but 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.150
 we will begin of course as you already 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 guessed with football yeah killed mean 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 Ferdinand then our for some reason 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.380
 this phrase from ingeniously yaroslav hasheka 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.779
 comes to mind after the departure of Spartacus from 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.220
 Cup in Russia throughout this match 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.949
 Spartacus fans several times 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.030
 charged from the stands it's not football it was 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.920
 We heard about it 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.600
 commentators own if it is not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.100
 football then that is definitely not 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 hockey Spartak narrow hockey in general 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.629
 speak hurt and do not need if it is not 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.520
 football and did not want then that it ask 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.039
 you over because it seems the easiest 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.600
 something it was something and something about it 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.079
 we will talk in the next few minutes 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.059
 Very detailed start pass word in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.250
 our studio at the stadium in cherkizov where 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.730
 Our colleague works a novel trushkin rum 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.730
 you are welcome 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.870
 hello colleagues hello my 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.690
 sports fans I would quote more 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.610
 another known maximum Tosno hit 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.440
 so I would say you can say that 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.300
 team from the second division went to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.280
 quarter finals and we can say that 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200
 valentin filatov got awesome 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.300
 a blow to the nine arut anton mitryushkin a 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.400
 and both statements will be true this 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.800
 beautiful outcome is a great deal 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.140
 which suggests that our 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.820
 Cup alive but first still let 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.560
 before we condole with moscow 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.330
 Spartak will hear the winners 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.280
 of today's game and we offer your 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.869
 attention of the interview which is my colleague 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.440
 Dmitry followed him from the head coach 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.150
 tosna and scorer 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.550
 Oleg Stanislavovich Leschinsky one of 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.500
 the main authors of today's sensation 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.180
 head coach of the club football club 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.360
 Tosna Oleg Stanislavovich 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.190
 your players are now on the more you are here and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.820
 emotions are diametrically opposite where 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.050
 your joy and where is your happiness joy 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.510
 and happiness is sometimes not always 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.330
 showing what is really 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.760
 so I am grateful to the guys who 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.179
 is on the football field I'm from your 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.760
 permissions have two guys thanks good 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.660
 do not keep with the head coach of football 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.790
 the club 100 knew the baptismal author 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.190
 unity jealous sword in this match and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.090
 certainly one of the best players in 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.590
 the composition of both teams valentines lats 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.510
 fly what do you feel now let's 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.370
 let's start with this but i think that we 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.650
 played well because the second mom 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.450
 old games and hail and we got 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.650
 Of course there were no moments on and we also 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.570
 we realized they are not good if more 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.340
 in detail due to which managed to win 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.610
 but when did you go here you understood 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.590
 will give it to Spartak but we looked 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.290
 the game of Spartacus we believe that not 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.330
 the best form and in fact all the same 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.460
 for good luck and concentration I remember that 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.530
 we got here 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.230
 due to humidity 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.750
 but let's set up the Spartacus season now 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.880
 started you before the start of the season even more 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.190
 of the month you are essentially at the training camp 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.640
 showed crazy form in particular 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.160
 how do you do it well 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 we got a physical training coach but 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.020
 and the prince give it fit will 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.140
 not bad said that in the best but 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.459
 does not look like this is what concerns 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.579
 victory is victory make good 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.140
 sight and yet you drove here but 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.030
 play let's say and then how are you 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.980
 generally suspected that you can afford 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.890
 so go out and beat Moscow Spartak 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.989
 in Moscow with a huge stadium with their 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.989
 fans honestly up 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.750
 our team 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.910
 this we saw now what's next what 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.060
 Thought Krasnodar ahead with on bidding times 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.460
 harder they were organized I consider 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.930
 the stronger someone even more 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.310
 suddenly good luck to you 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.200
 Valentin filat scored ball author 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.720
 a man who scores so handsome 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.849
 our ball is entitled to any judgment 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.680
 Yes, and no one for it now will not judge 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.230
 what winners simply aren't 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.750
 judge every coach has his own 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.610
 very hard match everyone has napoleon 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.950
 happens your waterloo how to survive it 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.109
 Spartak we will know maybe or we will 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.489
 guess from the words that we hear 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.110
 now played by the head coach 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.090
 red and white valery karpin and chief 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.470
 Spartak Football Club coach 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.070
 Valerievich Karpin Mahler ruining yours 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.490
 thoughts fashionable all that sense emotions 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.360
 feeling no olibria thoughts shame 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.350
 mountain visibility 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.980
 what is the reason for not getting a look there 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.000
 it is clear shaving soul underestimation 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.310
 rivals 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.620
 you saw it she aspect of ballista 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.890
 throughout the match or which 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.290
 the second house is gone but nonetheless 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.470
 it was possible for me because it did not work 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.400
 managed to score the moments were he scored 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.620
 very often Spartak played exclusively 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.690
 flanks it was such an installation or 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.160
 just did not work on Potter 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.200
 differently tombs team which 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.990
 playing in their villages demolished on the flanks 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.800
 mrs why not then 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.200
 last sample 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.940
 I didn’t get a bipod so they did n’t score 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.230
 It did not work, but it is probably difficult for yourself 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.820
 make something analyze by 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.020
 hot pursuit because it 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.960
 really very hard hit 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.700
 pride athlete and coach Spartak 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.560
 suffered a defeat from the team will remind 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.390
 second division go into the division 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.130
 now tosna leader for lost points 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.090
 but Spartak is also not in the Premier League 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.400
 last team 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.050
 Valery George to say things with 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.840
 which we are obliged to cling to it is not for 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.890
 underestimating the opponent perhaps this thing with 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.660
 which is hard to argue 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.490
 Well, besides Karpin said that in 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.880
 the second half, the dance from underestimating is no longer 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.250
 it was look now fragments 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.270
 overtime get up how it starts 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.460
 Spartacus extra time is 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.930
 the feeling that there may be underestimations 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.169
 already and no but there is absolutely no 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.110
 understanding how to deal with this team and 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.640
 in complete disorganization here and attack 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.140
 what is observed in the city of Spartacus 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.630
 no wonder 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.550
 Karpin urged to warm up wanted Carlos 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.750
 such a situation when a team needs 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.920
 a replacement was being prepared for the position 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.140
 central defender 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.080
 what could Spartak show here is a guy 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.420
 who came out for them the second half had 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.490
 Such a chance is a good moment and should 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.170
 it's time to drink past the goalkeeper however blow 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.110
 getting very weak after discount and 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.520
 bertha and this is naturally not a goal and this 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.830
 naturally too far still 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.500
 from became that Spartacus who all 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.670
 had to see in this match but in 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.690
 in fact, it was necessary 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.000
 to restructure before everything is moral 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.130
 Spartak and I guess what to do 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.550
 should not have been in a break between the second 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.800
 loan 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.960
 and 1 overtime or not in between 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.300
 first overtime him second trim off 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.630
 it was necessary at least between the first and 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.490
 the second 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.830
 country main time this one 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.290
 Filatov's stunning blow is hard here 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.610
 blame mitryushkin but it is difficult to do at all 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.470
 some conclusions for the time being 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.030
 as to how Spartak will be 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.160
 dispose of their goalkeeper we whom 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.900
 in a pen team immediately four and here 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.000
 mitryushkin so far missed two swords 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.849
 Spartak the first two official games 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.699
 this season did not score a single sword 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:16.459
 there is a feeling that Spartak is not very 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.199
 great ready yes until this feeling yet 

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:21.050
 probably too much to be carried away 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.659
 but not less than 2 matches 0 goals two 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.610
 the match is 90 minutes plus 120 minutes 0 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:27.139
 goals while we see today on the field 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.909
 Movsisyan and maybe he certainly is not up 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.390
 the end still got better 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.430
 but none the less 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.740
 all in the ranks who should attack but 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.020
 no one can drink this very much 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.240
 hard history spartak suffered 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.980
 defeat to merchants we know that valeri 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.720
 Karpin by and large delivered 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.340
 condition win anything this season 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.930
 cup win will not work 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.970
 so on this and have the right to expect that 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.950
 Spartak switch their entire 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.080
 might now fight for gold 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.180
 awards in the championship of Russia here
