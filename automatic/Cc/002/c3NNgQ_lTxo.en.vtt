00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
was the wrong heads for the drums so I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.020 
was the wrong heads for the drums so I
ordered<00:01:26.880> coming<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> g2s<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:29.189> place<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
ordered coming to g2s but I place the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
ordered coming to g2s but I place the
res<00:01:30.210> nose<00:01:30.360> first<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.259> sounded<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
res nose first see what sounded like and

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.410 
res nose first see what sounded like and
now<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.220> sound<00:01:32.430> awesome<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.180> gonna

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
now they sound awesome so I'm not gonna

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
now they sound awesome so I'm not gonna
bother<00:01:33.570> putting<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> GTS<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:35.340> might<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
bother putting the GTS on I might do it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:05:44.770 
bother putting the GTS on I might do it
later<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.439> anyway<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.180> kit

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.870 

especially<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.650> kick-drum<00:05:46.130> I<00:05:46.340> really<00:05:46.759> need

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
especially the kick-drum I really need

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.969 
especially the kick-drum I really need
to<00:05:46.910> replace<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.419> factory<00:05:47.630> risotto<00:05:48.199> it's<00:05:48.919> the

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
to replace the factory risotto it's the

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.580 
to replace the factory risotto it's the
only<00:05:49.130> original<00:05:49.610> head<00:05:50.000> left<00:05:50.240> on<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.509> kit<00:05:50.690> so<00:05:51.560> I

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
only original head left on the kit so I

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.800 
only original head left on the kit so I
feel<00:05:51.860> like<00:05:52.039> if<00:05:52.160> I<00:05:52.250> put<00:05:52.460> some<00:05:52.639> little<00:05:52.910> little

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
feel like if I put some little little

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.400 
feel like if I put some little little
thicker<00:05:54.080> on<00:05:54.169> there<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.620> my<00:05:54.710> sample<00:05:55.160> better

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
thicker on there to my sample better

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.230 
thicker on there to my sample better
other<00:05:57.410> than<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:57.740> pretty<00:05:58.580> happy<00:05:58.970> with<00:05:59.090> them

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
other than that pretty happy with them

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.350 
other than that pretty happy with them
honestly<00:05:59.930> I<00:06:00.500> think<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.610> toms<00:06:01.849> sound<00:06:02.120> pretty

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
honestly I think the toms sound pretty

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.760 
honestly I think the toms sound pretty
good<00:06:02.509> there

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
good there

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.290 
good there

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
they're definitely punchier than my

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.550 
they're definitely punchier than my
makeup<00:06:05.570> kit<00:06:05.720> I'm<00:06:05.930> used<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.169> the<00:06:06.289> sound<00:06:06.470> the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
makeup kit I'm used to the sound the

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.629 
makeup kit I'm used to the sound the
maple<00:06:06.860> it's<00:06:06.979> what<00:06:07.130> I've<00:06:07.220> been<00:06:07.250> playing<00:06:07.490> for

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
maple it's what I've been playing for

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.300 
maple it's what I've been playing for
years<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:08.150> so<00:06:08.300> this<00:06:09.020> kit<00:06:09.259> is<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.860> little<00:06:10.220> bit

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
years and so this kit is a little bit

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.629 
years and so this kit is a little bit
different<00:06:10.820> for<00:06:10.940> me<00:06:10.970> used<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.979> but<00:06:12.979> I'm<00:06:13.370> taking

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
different for me used to but I'm taking

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:22.600 
different for me used to but I'm taking
up<00:06:13.729> so<00:06:13.880> far<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:21.770> also<00:06:21.949> might<00:06:22.250> notice<00:06:22.400> that

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
up so far you also might notice that

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.309 
up so far you also might notice that
I've<00:06:22.819> got<00:06:23.000> these<00:06:23.150> tuned<00:06:23.389> up<00:06:23.720> a<00:06:23.930> little<00:06:24.110> higher

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
I've got these tuned up a little higher

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.469 
I've got these tuned up a little higher
than<00:06:24.680> what<00:06:25.250> most<00:06:25.550> of<00:06:25.669> you<00:06:25.729> guys<00:06:25.849> might<00:06:26.150> be<00:06:26.300> use

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
than what most of you guys might be use

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.899 
than what most of you guys might be use
them<00:06:26.630> at<00:06:26.860> these<00:06:27.860> birch<00:06:28.070> hills<00:06:28.370> will<00:06:28.610> go<00:06:28.729> really

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
them at these birch hills will go really

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.510 
them at these birch hills will go really
low<00:06:29.210> but<00:06:29.599> most<00:06:30.320> of<00:06:30.440> the<00:06:30.530> gigs<00:06:30.710> i<00:06:30.860> play<00:06:31.039> my<00:06:31.250> toms

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
low but most of the gigs i play my toms

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.210 
low but most of the gigs i play my toms
aren't<00:06:31.789> mic<00:06:31.970> so<00:06:32.449> i<00:06:32.750> find<00:06:33.530> it<00:06:33.650> beneficial<00:06:33.800> to

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
aren't mic so i find it beneficial to

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.800 
aren't mic so i find it beneficial to
have<00:06:34.699> them<00:06:34.820> up<00:06:34.909> a<00:06:34.940> little<00:06:35.150> higher<00:06:35.330> just<00:06:35.690> so

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
have them up a little higher just so

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.110 
have them up a little higher just so
they<00:06:35.930> project<00:06:36.169> a<00:06:36.440> little<00:06:36.680> better<00:06:36.880> they<00:06:37.880> still

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
they project a little better they still

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.860 
they project a little better they still
