 nobody needs hemorrhoids 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.050
 professions are there really so few fools 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.590
 who can do this 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.750
 I'll go and draw on and then sample how 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.740
 I have all the necessary zadrota as well 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.740
 of the present 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 surely every third player was created 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.120
 the same question to whom are not important 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.489
 a progression on this score is possible on dozens 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.220
 There are many answer options 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.559
 the advantages that each of them gives 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.620
 I will try to explain this video 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.260
 why right and so important and you need 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.570
 download them and after all you listened 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.120
 you can already choose you need it 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.100
 or not and 1 is right about which i will talk 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.230
 today is the mark 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.449
 since most rights do not require 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.570
 time-consuming training 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.670
 especially on raids x something happened 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.560
 becomes a universal remedy 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.840
 earnings and partial upgrade 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.750
 equipping your il someone's things 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.119
 why you should start with the mark 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.190
 everything is just one of the most 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.800
 common and at the same time not 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.340
 intricate wide range of production 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.220
 Things a profession began learning leaves from 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.500
 half an hour to a whole day it all depends on 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.020
 your knowledge of finding herbs as well 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.420

 auction or buy all engri for 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.560
 pumping themselves from readers to advise 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.690
 you yourself want to swing that right 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.030
 and it is better to download and simultaneously with 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.240
 inscription and now move on to the study 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.670

 these grind outlines gives a bonus to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.769
 characteristics of the form of improvement on the shoulders 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.200
 you can create improvement yourself 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.019
 choosing which characteristics you need 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.970
 that create traced or traced or 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.269
 create quite a few different things 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.830
 not always in demand in the market 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.500
 others only at the beginning of the content 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.069
 thanks to the profession of writing you can 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.530
 create 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.349
 characters are an improvement for your 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.569
 spells and abilities scrolls in the game 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.129
 a wide variety of scrolls are available 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.379
 some of them boost your 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.420
 characteristic I raise the characteristics with 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.459
 the higher the group or raid and also give 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.799
 opportunity or port you to a place 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.780

 items on readers can create 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.920
 many fan items for example books 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.170
 which will transform player wolves 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.569
 or scrolls that will release a swarm 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.640
 ships taking into account the fact that the mark 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.280
 gives improvement on the shoulders 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.250
 similar improvements can still be obtained 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.730
 by pumping reputation with fractions 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.290
 long and dreary is best his back 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.419
 your twinkie 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.230
 you can use your 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.660
 auction buying on it a series of agents either 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.430
 picking up the grass yourself is good to start 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.889
 to pump profession together with 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.680
 Herbalism while collecting weed 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.139
 and grinding it into reagents with small 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.450
 levels and it is possible and at high 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.280
 level pump profession profession 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.829
 inexpensive to park glasses compared to 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.410
 other professions in the game of course 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.229
 as an inexpensive tell on 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.030
 x5 it will not be too expensive because 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.639
 are there other gold rutons 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.950
 She x100 may be overpriced and 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.560
 now a little about how to make money 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.750
 on the mark of gold as in all 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.479
 Professions the biggest profit possible 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.910
 earn started content in the end 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.860
 demand falls and therefore prices 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.349
 stable earnings for readers 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.080
 brings the sale of characters that are needed 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.510
 all new characters without exception 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.940
 I recommend you read guides on others 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.370
 class to know which characters 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.510
 I recommend to put on them and will be the most 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.730
 high demand can also be sold 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.370
 flowers but the demand for them is natural 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.530
 less content started very well 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.530
 you can earn by selling things about 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.540
 friends and accessories 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.000
 for the outline you will need 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.460
 chop a lot of grass all the time 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.670
 mouse button to select a spell 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.740
 then the grass in the bag is generally uncomfortable 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.590
 say therefore recommend you 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.110
 special macros for grinding and 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.720
