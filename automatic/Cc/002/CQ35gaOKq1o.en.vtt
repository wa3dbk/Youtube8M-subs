00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.290 
pretty early in Gemma this is like a
cross<00:02:02.770> specialist<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.670> think<00:02:03.970> showed<00:02:04.150> us

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
cross specialist I think showed us

strength<00:02:04.600> really<00:02:04.960> well<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.560> tried<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.250> hang

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
strength really well so I tried to hang

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.490 
strength really well so I tried to hang
in<00:02:07.270> there<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.720> see<00:02:07.900> how<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.110> race<00:02:08.320> would

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500

unfold<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.310> picked<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.910> moment<00:02:10.390> where<00:02:10.630> I

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
unfold and picked a moment where I

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.840 
unfold and picked a moment where I
thought<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.320> could<00:02:11.590> probably<00:02:11.860> make<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.220> move<00:02:12.550> and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
thought I could probably make a move and

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.910 
thought I could probably make a move and
and<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.390> move<00:02:13.600> paid<00:02:13.900> off<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.590> was<00:02:14.770> happy

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and the move paid off so I was happy

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.350 
and the move paid off so I was happy
with<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.400> win<00:02:16.920> lucky<00:02:17.920> guys<00:02:18.190> adrian<00:02:18.940> jackson
