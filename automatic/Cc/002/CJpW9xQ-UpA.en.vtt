00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.940
 is that here is the small one 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.829

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.450

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.150

 brought yes i give the a 1 490 we see 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.620
 Could only with concluding series 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.480
 threaten aconto as it should be 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.770
 and the guy is already running around again 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.410
 want to fight 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.870
 but not colleague with me you are you 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.650
 you are the minister 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.979
 gunnar meyer hello he is now 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.259
 walking around or what not even 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.880
 gone na matter 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.580
 and yes parks I have hardliner 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.220
 bulletproof vest of course and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.429
 toughness looters as it should be 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.929
 and last but not least tactic mask or 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.240
 extreme conditions are one of the two 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.229
 I'm not so sure 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.359
 and I actually buy one 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.270
 really horny in the nap only up to now 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:32.020
 every map out on the door actually 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.299
 even on every map there are 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.049
 actually really disgusting spots the 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.429
 sponsors of disgusting I do not know the 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.039
 spawn here now back and there the map 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.139
 so small is back there boni that 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.329
 already on the map I have now 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:49.170
 a little bit when you're actually in 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.659
 the no opportunity has Allofs and 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.429
 lengthy connected lobes 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.360
 The spot is still there 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.420
 it is because 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.650
 there 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.650
 no distance 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.760
 it is so and now they come here 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.860
 again that's so far 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:15.990
 no idea I would go crazy almost 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.990
 say you already play before 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 One is before we work here again 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.460
 a bit and then we would have 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.460
 on the orbit 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.780
 if now no outside comes here 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.400
 I have the orbit 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.700
 and he comes here now and jump 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.260
 of course, it must have its jumper 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.390
 of course he has the advantage 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.730
 because I just shoot in the feet amt 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.830
 that's how it has to be 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.570
 oh my god ten to zero i can 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.840
 just do not go flow it works 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.290
 Not 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.620
 that does not work we can do that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.740
 Not 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.320
 But Kopf actually makes a lot of fun 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:11.490
 you have to say something does not go 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.650
 So, I have a little something 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.510
 someone with c4 of further distance 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.310
 Killed and I mean here with the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.650
 spots, by the way, you will be in front 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.420
 The sponsoring is actually the sponsoring 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.610
 really far away the problem is 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.209
 only there are no things that somehow 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.989
 You have to protect my one way 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:35.310
 I do not think so because they are here 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:38.400
 what is going on down there and now 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.890
 Do you want to go back there ? 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.660
 really see for yourself 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.990
 actually ridiculous actually 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.030
 ridiculous but it's half so bad 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.370
 I think a lot of multi team 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.720
 or so fast with him, it is so 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.580
 which of abdi maps so you can even 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.350
 sketched that is so fat one with one 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.520
 two or so with a loud there goes the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.520
 maps so hard 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:13.730
 sda ok now everyone has that spirit again 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.769
 just escort without the takes itself 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:22.330
 now, namely random the opponent 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.009
 connection i thought just suits 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.920
 I go there to the stores and 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:34.350
 there is someone with 1 2 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.350
 He lies on the floor like a servant 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.670
 holy escort without but that makes me 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:46.920
 Actually, that's nothing to me 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.920
 matter because pretty much over the game and 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.110
 she just got me is that 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.240
 Ridiculous is the ridiculous no matter 24 too 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.690
 four write me my comments like 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.160
 this match finds mapco who the island 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.600
 I think I really hot, I have to 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.920
 I really like saying outside 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.940
 but at the moment that's somehow 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.080
 still on every map so and so easy 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.490
 this video if you liked it 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.830
 the last video if it is not you 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.180
 liked if you need points 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.610
 for the map pack which of course one 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.480
 month later now for the playstation 3 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.160
 then come out at the bottom 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.740
 a spontaneously come over the psn 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.740
 cards buy itunes cards microsoft 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.210
 All well, I say goodbye 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.210
 rejected and the 1
