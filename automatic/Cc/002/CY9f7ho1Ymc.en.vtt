00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.909
 so this is of course very important not only for indoors but 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.530
 It also came from outside because it can prevent you from getting into the body 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.090
 toy or a cuddly toy that turns out to be worth a lot of money and what 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.669
 you can just quit school 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.759
 and had just won the head that is of course very nice 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.249
 that is why we have the section between art and no chance in July 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.769
 course or toy or in black and white 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.929
 value could have been valued 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.369
 with our experts the rise is again today 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.869
 fantastic 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.560
 nice that you are all there 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.949
 and called the fourth time 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.300
 I don't want to but was limited 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.720
 this is your hug 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.269
 that does not stop the violence from stopping 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.159
 the top club this case 9 the last time I have received but except 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.090
 leading the open house yes 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.080
 so this has a lot of value for you and the question is whether it really is 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 value for other people your grandfather has not known 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.310
 the term 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.040
 it only happens in the meantime and women 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.320
 nice come an exciting 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.160
 welcome to between the arts and no chance 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.420
 the gouda he thanked what you have in the shelling cost saving sometimes also 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.259
 are worthless 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.219
 lock couples maybe a little bit around how ciao 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.140
 of course never be anything 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.090
 the final item that does the action 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.150
 Veldhoven, slaughter month tip really is taken a lot further, moderate 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640
 Frankfurt 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.640
 maybe an idea 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.790
 veghel 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.170
 who prove themselves 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.840
 and through that wim d lotti 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.580
 and it looks a bit 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.270
 go hand-in-hand with the proposal 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.370
 ian poulter hold name 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.990
 And that is it 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.790
 our expert risk 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.620
 when getting excited 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.420
 because it is self-built things that are out 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.600
 often worth a lot of money because his productivity has been troubled 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.840
 very important 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 turn the word 9 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.130
 don't know many people I will be able to teach for a while 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.470
 So your self-esteem country came from now comes originally 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.209
 3 9 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.709
 it was actually euro and added the neanderthals they came to people 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.909
 have lived chins 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.659
 tribute that also lived in the cave that was often dark and but also often scared in it 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.499
 to be dark for years a Catholic congregation session say one very hard one 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:27.099
 offender wakes up from the pain sources that give the hood's eyes with a 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.099
 credit card that developed church apple's ipad 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:35.239
 through black shops and the like through the south of the country to normal man 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.999
 was interesting 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.109
 why conform you find more countries is actually so important finally too 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.059
 next to anton corbijn 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.709
 I think it is often not too long 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.709
 because what else is the darkness? 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.299
 after they have him you sometimes want to london 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.069
 I can disappoint myself 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.959
 he really isn't 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.979
 because it wasn't in April 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.709
 when i'm in front of a couch in the dark it doesn't bother 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.389
 then I saw the legs of my bed and when I heard more noises 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.569
 I was able to get out of bed through the bend on the floor 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.559
 if someone was unwell behind, at least get rid of air and he must 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.649
 probably bruised ribs 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.939
 but it is but everyone goes more naturally in their own way 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.939
 I believe the experts meanwhile 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.579
 in the capital Seoul 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.279
 well i have incredible trump news and that is not often done within this 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.379
 program 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.940
 This homemade lantern brother for you is made eefting 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.209
 the insurance value of the shock 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.419
 between 7 and 9 thousand euros ful 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.179
 A lot of money 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:47.149
 awesome 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.219
 what are you going to do with it 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:50.329
 lee 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.830
 why mix 9 sales target 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.109
 The sales police officer becomes a home-made nightmare for peace 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.609
 ten other brothers will also be born 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.609
 you would say but that is not so 10 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.099
 but it finds a very stubborn one 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.149
 but now there must be 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.149
 have a nice day to see you 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.819
 I never thought that this day could stand behind the number of jobs 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.159
 that the project 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.319
 has made to myself I know what I can and I can know it
