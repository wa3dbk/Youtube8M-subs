00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.070
 it's good after you have to continue 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.560
 work too 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.480
 that's fine I think we have 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.400
 sent a handsome man and good message 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.260
 because last week of the year 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.480
 had 12 with 12 players on the field 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.890
 I was posting it was it something 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.300
 of very positive now it's 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.920
 really the party this year that we 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.690
 must we really have to worry 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.710
 I think it's starting to come in a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:01:09.399
 little in the heads of the players now 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:01:10.509
 there the road paul is not it done 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.759
 a lot but well on the other hand it's 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.240
 for that in a squat of 22 25 27 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.460
 players so abandoned when there are 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.320
 whoever misses their matches makes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.670
 that they are forced to complete their match 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.289
 it gives the chance to others and 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.759
 I hope that those who go to them 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.970
 replace will take his chance is 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.340
 given 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.649
 we as a staff we trust 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.030
 all our scot so there is no 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.030
 problem is on wii 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.229
 the ps is only 6 points with had 12 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.450
 it's something very positive 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.369
 now also we must try 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.459
 to put everything in its place and it's true 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.709
 that maybe maybe the volume of 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.390
 game was not as high quality 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.619
 so in this side we lingered to 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.940
 our task we did we did a 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.420
 good match but hey this game is forgotten 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.300
 we put it mediocre hard I think 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.320
 they have no their label 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.000
 two great favorites of the competition 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.250
 for a game because the first two 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.540
 matches are made are pretty clear by 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.890
 report to them to win at 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.230
 become things this year so he 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.130
 we will have to arrive with the with 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.470
 our best attack and our 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.180
 best defense and if we want to try 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:34.940
 to enter the match and after 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.940
 to think about that
