they're<00:00:32.429> going<00:00:32.609> to<00:00:32.699> spawn<00:00:32.879> in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> number<00:00:33.480> two

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
they're going to spawn in the number two

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.290 
they're going to spawn in the number two
spot<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.559> say<00:00:34.739> what's<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> pressure<00:00:35.340> here's

the<00:00:36.420> pressure<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.109> green<00:00:37.379> is<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> pressure

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the pressure the green is the pressure

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.389 
the pressure the green is the pressure
and<00:00:38.579> once<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.089> enter<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> green<00:00:40.100> they<00:00:41.100> should

spawn in the number three spot now the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.489 
spawn in the number three spot now the
red<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> their<00:00:45.089> spawn<00:00:45.329> point<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.199> is<00:00:46.350> an

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
red is their spawn point and here is an

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:50.329 
red is their spawn point and here is an
example<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.420> pushing<00:00:49.320> gold<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
example so I'm pushing gold I see on the

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.849 
example so I'm pushing gold I see on the
mini-map<00:00:50.609> there's<00:00:51.210> no<00:00:51.539> pressure<00:00:51.839> for<00:00:52.530> them<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
mini-map there's no pressure for them to

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.369 
mini-map there's no pressure for them to
spawn<00:00:53.100> backwards<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.089> their<00:00:54.870> teams<00:00:55.079> already

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
spawn backwards and their teams already

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.750 
spawn backwards and their teams already
spawning<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.010> number<00:00:56.339> one<00:00:56.519> and<00:00:56.730> number

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
spawning in the number one and number

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.290 
spawning in the number one and number
two<00:00:57.089> spot<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.809> once<00:00:58.019> i<00:00:58.140> apply<00:00:58.440> pressure<00:00:59.300> I'm

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
two spot now once i apply pressure I'm

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
two spot now once i apply pressure I'm
going<00:01:00.809> once<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.350> kill<00:01:01.409> them<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.800> instantly<00:01:02.190> apply

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
going once I kill them I instantly apply

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.249 
going once I kill them I instantly apply
pressure<00:01:02.819> and<00:01:03.179> I<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
pressure and I know that are going to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.350 
pressure and I know that are going to
spawn<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> number<00:01:05.189> three<00:01:05.399> spot<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:08.360> here's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
spawn in the number three spot so here's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.520 
spawn in the number three spot so here's
another<00:01:10.110> view<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:11.640> case<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.180> forgot<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
another view in case you forgot the one

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
another view in case you forgot the one
and<00:01:13.950> two<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> main<00:01:14.520> spawn<00:01:14.820> points<00:01:15.210> but

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and two is the main spawn points but

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
and two is the main spawn points but
once<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> apply<00:01:15.869> pressure<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
once you apply pressure they go to the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.209 
once you apply pressure they go to the
number<00:01:17.729> three<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.770> just<00:01:19.770> showed<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.009> guys

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.600 
number three now I just showed you guys
the<00:01:20.280> yellow<00:01:20.939> arrow<00:01:21.240> view<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.250> if<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> wanted

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the yellow arrow view and if you wanted

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.130 
the yellow arrow view and if you wanted
to<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> teammate<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.630> push<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to have a teammate you can push up the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.499 
to have a teammate you can push up the
purple<00:01:25.560> side<00:01:25.710> which<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:25.920> summit<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
purple side which is summit and of the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.300 
purple side which is summit and of the
blue<00:01:27.630> side<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:28.110> i<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> once

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
blue side which i do right here so once

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.279 
blue side which i do right here so once
again<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> mini-map<00:01:33.210> no<00:01:33.630> one's<00:01:33.810> pushed<00:01:34.079> up

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
again on the mini-map no one's pushed up

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.289 
again on the mini-map no one's pushed up
now<00:01:34.860> we're<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.399> that<00:01:35.549> triple<00:01:35.850> cap<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
now we're going for that triple cap and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
now we're going for that triple cap and
I<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.469> kill<00:01:37.649> here<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.369> my

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
I don't get the kill here but my

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.550 
I don't get the kill here but my
teammate<00:01:38.850> does<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> he<00:01:39.689> knows<00:01:39.869> exactly<00:01:40.020> where

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
teammate does and he knows exactly where

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.969 
teammate does and he knows exactly where
they<00:01:40.680> spawn<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> he<00:01:42.780> pushes<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> dom

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
they spawn so he pushes up in the a dom

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.279 
they spawn so he pushes up in the a dom
spot<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.609> does<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.090> exact<00:01:45.479> same<00:01:45.509> thing<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.170> did

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
spot and does the exact same thing I did

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.410 
spot and does the exact same thing I did
in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> video<00:01:46.859> before

enemy's perspective and he got the
number<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.200> spawn<00:01:59.619> point<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.280> there<00:02:00.460> is

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
number to spawn point so there is

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.940 
number to spawn point so there is
pressure<00:02:00.939> where<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.140> pressure<00:02:02.350> right

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
pressure where is the pressure right

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.430 
pressure where is the pressure right
there<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:03.520> look<00:02:03.700> at<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.049> teammates<00:02:05.049> there's
