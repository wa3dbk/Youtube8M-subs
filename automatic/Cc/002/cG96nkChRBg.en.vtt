00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.909
 Enjoy a parachute jump because when you attack Marshmallows 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.910
 Because they do everything right, they do not believe they are second 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.639
 In the truest sense of the word, they immediately plunge into a vehicle here 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 a tank and they woo at most to take a passenger with him 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 should pressure the defenders from the beginning 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.050
 Glass is an exciting but largely unmolested towards the enemy to shoot 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.169
 and do not forget 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.599
 The defenders have endless tickets 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.029
 the graduation rate does not happen otherwise then it comes to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.720
 disorders 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.430
 fight for me 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.340
 If you want with the tank over the left flank, here you can 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 puts both houses by mobile phone 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.160
 They also put the fire on themselves so that their colleagues in the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 Meanwhile box the donations can 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.220
 you can come to the European Championships - broken even after a heavy cannon 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.220
 shoot but that lasts 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.160
 Storm them up with the second place on the right through the forest 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.300
 deeply grateful 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.540
 while they are missing a lot of trees which the colleagues behind him cover 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.039
 to take 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.039
 but the glue makes sense to them too quickly 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.770
 On the attacker side, it's very important to be as close to the front as possible 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.500
 a Koblenz in weight so they save long terms and 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.380
 keep the attacking wave going 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.390
 Before getting started, they can even give them their class in these colleagues 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 adjust accordingly 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.280
 As standard, at every stage of the attack, it is indispensable to hold the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.310
 Attackers not only alive In the summer, fallen comrades are there 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.710
 on the legs 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.890
 Keep up with their revival to refund the limited tickets 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.760
 those in the branches of Manex are surprisingly ineffective the Sanis 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760
 So maybe you should not fight at the front line 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.090
 Defending a defender remotely will not take him any further if she does 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.810
 So if you want to know as a sniper then please also with the free play 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.580
 Department stores aiming device thus disable the enemy attach 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 or attack them directly the EM is coming 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.819
 both underserved in Business Night 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.089
 because 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:32.310
 If you do not want to get involved in the front, you can do it over in front of you 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.730
 this little spokesman Bruno mark them opponents as well they look forward 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.410
 occasionally a steerable packages from which must be routed to the finish 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.759
 But be careful about the VW quickly broken and if they are still on the 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.239
 Joystick sit down with Rob to lose ticket so timely the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.239
 Connection hats 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.599
 from 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.369
 rtr 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.180
 destroyed by both boxes are the map enlarged once the 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:16.129
 They should also be able to do the same thing 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.260
 if they are then fast Ford on the road they can the defenders 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.549
 sometimes even in the first to grab the hang out vehicles exactly 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.769
 we do that now 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.659
 the clever here the board Lech armored personnel carrier and rob ours 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.659
 Opponents thus probably their strongest weapon in this section 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.529
 if he can do that with the landslide in the next section, they are 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.529
 Fine shoot alternative, so just do the thing 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:58.379
 and do not forget to keep up the pressure and take Maddox with you 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.379
 that too 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.019
 parked off
