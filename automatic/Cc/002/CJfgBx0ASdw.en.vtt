was<00:04:55.320> okay<00:04:55.890> but<00:04:57.440> really<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.740> board<00:04:59.280> game<00:04:59.490> is

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
was okay but really the board game is

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.550 
was okay but really the board game is
where<00:04:59.820> this<00:04:59.940> game<00:05:00.180> sign<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.810> met<00:05:01.050> commander

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
where this game sign and met commander

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.210 
where this game sign and met commander
actually<00:05:03.080> it's<00:05:04.080> not<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:04.260> perfect<00:05:04.530> simulation

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
actually it's not a perfect simulation

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.970

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.310 

which<00:06:31.720> I<00:06:33.390> don't<00:06:34.390> know<00:06:34.510> is<00:06:34.660> get<00:06:34.780> a<00:06:34.810> kick<00:06:35.110> out<00:06:35.290> of

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
which I don't know is get a kick out of

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.320 
which I don't know is get a kick out of
it<00:06:35.730> there<00:06:36.730> near<00:06:36.970> the<00:06:37.000> end<00:06:38.820> but<00:06:39.820> there<00:06:40.120> isn't<00:06:40.300> a

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
it there near the end but there isn't a

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.970 
it there near the end but there isn't a
whole<00:06:40.360> lot<00:06:40.510> of<00:06:40.690> cinematics<00:06:41.200> unfortunately<00:06:41.890> in

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
whole lot of cinematics unfortunately in

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.960 
whole lot of cinematics unfortunately in
this<00:06:42.100> game<00:06:42.370> but<00:06:43.110> in<00:06:44.110> fact<00:06:44.500> in<00:06:45.250> some<00:06:45.310> ways<00:06:45.610> I

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
this game but in fact in some ways I

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.900 
this game but in fact in some ways I
think<00:06:46.050> the<00:06:47.050> Wing<00:06:47.290> Commander<00:06:47.860> style<00:06:48.520> you<00:06:48.880> know

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
think the Wing Commander style you know

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.340 
think the Wing Commander style you know
you<00:06:49.060> have<00:06:49.210> like<00:06:49.360> the<00:06:49.480> cutscenes<00:06:49.900> in<00:06:50.050> between

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
you have like the cutscenes in between

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.010 
you have like the cutscenes in between
we<00:06:50.560> have<00:06:50.680> a<00:06:50.740> good<00:06:51.390> story<00:06:52.390> arc<00:06:52.660> that<00:06:52.810> you<00:06:52.900> have

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
we have a good story arc that you have

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.020 
we have a good story arc that you have
the<00:06:53.140> game<00:06:53.350> it's<00:06:53.950> almost<00:06:54.070> separate<00:06:54.640> before

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
the game it's almost separate before

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.000 
the game it's almost separate before
side<00:06:55.300> of<00:06:55.450> the<00:06:55.510> story<00:06:55.960> I<00:06:56.230> think<00:06:56.740> I<00:06:56.800> met

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
side of the story I think I met

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.340 
side of the story I think I met
commander<00:06:57.630> doing<00:06:58.630> that<00:06:58.900> with<00:06:59.050> a<00:06:59.080> mech
