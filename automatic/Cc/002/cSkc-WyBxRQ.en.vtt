00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 a video that is of a hidden trick that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.949
 now it has become quite famous 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.230
 although there are many people who know him well 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.660
 that I will make the video for these people like 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.480
 you know in all versions of android 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.640
 of all the settings there is the option of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.090
 about the telephone or information of the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.699
 phone 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.529
 here I am running chiribÃ­n here to 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.329
 write sandwich then when we go 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.130
 to bring the phone closer 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.290
 we go over to forgiveness now in this 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.320
 I'm running an interpreter now 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.420
 same inside the fence of the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 phone there is the section version of the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.219
 firmware or version of android where 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 if we press several times you do not know this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.719
 Curious drawing and each android version 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.059
 has his this is the one that comes out 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.520
 internet that is because it is quite like 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.140
 controversial since they can indicate that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.390
 all the zombies that go with the phone 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.789
 They are the ones who have an iphone and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 this is the one that rescues or that the own 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.600
 androids like the zombie that is then 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.640
 as conquering the whole world 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.150
 and when gingerbread went out there by the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
 2011 of 2010 because really android not 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.940
 he had so much quota and now he has it like that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.009
 that maybe a bit of zombie effect is 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.020
 is doing done I do not know if this is what 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.759
 which indicates now let's for example what 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.610
 go with new android versions 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.909
 here if I'm running yer bing there what 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.520
 you see android version 4.1.2 and here are 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.860
 double trick if we press several times 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.229
 this second part of the trick comes out if 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.840
 we keep pressed elba julia happy 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.940
 it goes away and a series of beans appear 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 and the third thing is that we can 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.800
 pick them up and throw them out of the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.319
 screen or where we want then this 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.610
 It is also compatible with the funds of 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.190
 screen that we have in our phone 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.159
 this is not fixed is what I wear 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.020
 on the screen then of the home screen and 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.600
 in the same way as with the part of homes 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.240
 who can we even interact with what 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.950
 which is the wallpaper of the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.280
 same way that we would in our 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.619
 screen then these are two tricks 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.729
 from android that are quite curious and 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.220
