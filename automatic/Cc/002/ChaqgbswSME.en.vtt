convinced myself that that would stop

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.010 
convinced myself that that would stop
myself<00:07:05.219> from<00:07:05.550> getting<00:07:06.150> more<00:07:06.419> injured<00:07:06.780> and

myself from getting more injured and

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.379 
myself from getting more injured and

up<00:07:18.360> my<00:07:18.479> recovery<00:07:18.870> all<00:07:18.990> that<00:07:19.139> much<00:07:19.349> and<00:07:19.620> but<00:07:20.400> I

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
up my recovery all that much and but I

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.950 
up my recovery all that much and but I
did<00:07:20.639> use<00:07:20.849> it<00:07:20.879> what<00:07:21.419> do<00:07:21.479> I<00:07:21.539> use<00:07:21.689> it<00:07:21.870> again

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
did use it what do I use it again

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.050 
did use it what do I use it again
probably<00:07:22.620> not<00:07:22.860> it's<00:07:23.069> a<00:07:23.129> lot<00:07:23.310> cheaper<00:07:23.340> too<00:07:23.939> when

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
probably not it's a lot cheaper too when

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.610 
probably not it's a lot cheaper too when
I<00:07:24.090> used<00:07:24.360> it<00:07:24.539> three<00:07:24.750> years<00:07:24.930> ago<00:07:25.050> or<00:07:25.409> two<00:07:25.590> years

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
I used it three years ago or two years

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.619 
I used it three years ago or two years
ago<00:07:25.860> I<00:07:26.279> do<00:07:26.639> know<00:07:26.879> it's<00:07:27.000> a<00:07:27.029> lot<00:07:27.180> cheaper<00:07:27.389> now

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:27.629 
ago I do know it's a lot cheaper now

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:29.300 
ago I do know it's a lot cheaper now
it's<00:07:27.750> a<00:07:27.779> lot<00:07:27.960> easier<00:07:28.289> to<00:07:28.379> get<00:07:28.500> hold<00:07:28.740> of<00:07:28.889> so

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
it's a lot easier to get hold of so

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.399 
it's a lot easier to get hold of so
maybe<00:07:29.550> maybe<00:07:29.939> I<00:07:30.090> would<00:07:30.360> I'd<00:07:30.810> hope<00:07:30.990> not<00:07:31.139> to<00:07:31.289> be

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:31.409 
maybe maybe I would I'd hope not to be

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.140 
maybe maybe I would I'd hope not to be
in<00:07:31.500> that<00:07:31.620> position<00:07:31.770> and<00:07:32.189> I<00:07:32.250> wish<00:07:32.879> you<00:07:33.000> all<00:07:33.090> the
