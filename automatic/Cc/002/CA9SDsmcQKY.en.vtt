00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.440
 Y 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 as you well and you saw that 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.490
 they got their preliminaries with very good 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 results yes we are very happy a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.410
 growth of 20.4 percent with the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 highest profitability in the history of 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 quálitas a road the 43.7 goes very well and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.940
 how this growth occurs because it was 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 thanks to the sale of new cars 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 we estimate that 30 percent of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.580
 new cars are insured with 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.769
 qualitas and we also grew in the 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.809
 fleet segment 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.309
 and also what through and what equalitas 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.650
 is the number one in the market that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.379
 growth potential you see a lot 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.620
 one in four cars is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.769
 insured in Mexico and we also have a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.330
 median in the population of 27 years what 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.240
 which means that all these young people 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.390
 will go out and buy cars 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 and talking about how they achieved the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.010
 43.7 percent was a sum of several 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.800
 measures between them we change our 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.500
 subscription model 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.750
 three months we update the prices of 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.850
 5000 types of vehicles in 120 zones 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 geographic 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.800
 we change the variable remuneration is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.620
 say we are 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.080
 aligning interests among policyholders 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.930
 agents service offices and 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.370
 shareholders and so you can name a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.380
 series of measures the most important thing is 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.160
 that the administration of quálitas is 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.390
 100% focused on the specialized business 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.670
 in auto insurance that's why we can 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.550
 have deficiencies in the processes ok and 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.440
 well that you are something sustainable the 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.910
 administration will work to be 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.410
 profitable 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.570
 but many of these benefits are going to 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.570
 transfer to the insured is a market 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.280
 We are not the only competitors and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.710
 also the competition the things the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.540
 things very well 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.270
 but the important thing is that the economies 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.910
 of scale of quálitas by purchases 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.500
 What are we doing right now? 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.230
 give important improvements for the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.800
 future ok and as in the marketability of 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.120
 the company quite well this year we have 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.860
 operated 8 million pesos daily 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.600
 so I think any of your 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.910
 Better boss broker clients can 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.739
 start operating qualitas we also have 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.470
 market trainer where we close the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.330
 spread then it will be very easy 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.420
 we have other measures but then other 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.140
 clear talk we arrived first the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.140
 ladies general of a
