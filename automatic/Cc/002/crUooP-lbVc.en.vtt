00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.599
 video let's see the notes in 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.550
 first position vasistas what is it 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.029
 what are these notes 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.160
 which is at the top of the neck with the 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.769
 empty cords and that will belong to 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.510
 C major, ie do mi mi sol 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.660
 the sooner you are ready for this trip 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.199
 interstellar notes so follow me 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.930
 by the time here we are then decked out of 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.900
 our pretty bass we have four 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.799
 ropes that empty gives notes mines 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.360
 the true and only me being the rope the 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.030
 bigger and single the most rope 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.159
 fine so have we go from the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 rope closest to us that's at 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.140
 say the rope half and it'll be the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.000
 first note of our two ranges put 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.920
 then after a friend in a range 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.450
 there is an end so the fail will be played 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.650
 first box of half agreement here finally 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.820
 then after the end we have one 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.530
 So the soil 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.650
 he's going to be playing third case on the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.210
 point ground so the first notes of 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.460
 our two ranges on the bass these mini fa 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.070
 So here we go if we continue 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.720
 range we have a there the there we arrive on 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.660
 our second body david there 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.310
 Then we will play the sea 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.580
 is on the second box of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.450
 rope here by here it's very 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.850
 good here here we are after we played 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.820
 to a gift this is the third box of the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 rope of the always on the point so 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.020
 it makes us do so and singing more 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.010
 the insolent then we're going to have a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.410
 it is the next empty rope 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.680
 here is the penultimate rope when leaving 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.660
 from us then we are going to have a mii 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.130
 but you will tell me but we already have 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.479
 played friends actually it was that one 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.720
 but here we are going to play a second 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.370
 that is the octave of this one here 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.000
 so this look table is to say that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.890
 it's a note 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.870
 if it is more acute the high flow octa 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.990
 it's the same but playing more treble so 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.040
 there we have a friend at the hospital 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.680
 then after friend at the hospital we have 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.300
 finally third box also at the octave 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.160
 so we are hungry then we 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.560
 continue our journey in the octaves 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.950
 since we arrive on the ground ropes 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.500
 empty 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.510
 the last the finer then we 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.600
 will have played a the second must of the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.489
 ground rope so second can the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.110
 first must excuse me at the second 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.620
 box of the ground rope and pro b must 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.409
 then we played so fourth 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:57.599
 gas and we end up on the back back 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:03:03.440
 we take over by women only ropes to 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.440
 empty the camp david's coy 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:18.799
 when david are there if we and we 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:23.239
 are going to make the trip back if the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.239
 only when the woman's life 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:33.390
 when david doc 6 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:39.660
 the agreement david only ends but ends 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.379
 all so she is not beautiful life 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.790

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.959
 the bass so how do we go about it 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.090
