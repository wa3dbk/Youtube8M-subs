 He drove a while ago I got some users and owners there 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.740
 and as right-wing parties to see that well in that trap with his plans 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.430
 should work out 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.920
 but that is really nice to see that they were out of the boxes within ten minutes 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.810
 sold out we thought first quarter but then there was church we had 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.240
 looked at the time of the first part set times of the lower part 6 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.570
 if they really sell out within ten minutes and I will 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.150
 quite some 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.490
 And yes it is of course an adjustment to what is in this box and it was the only thing 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.480
 I could tell it's one 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.559
 but if more than 100 euros 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.989
 and that really only my favorite products are in the box and that it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.240
 a little bit different 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.300
 and after that i have the boxit year 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.700
 and on 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.410
 100,000 visitors were able to get hold of the block six but also really whole 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.760
 not many people and that is why I thought it would be nice to have a chain-collision video 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.040
 just make the almunia i have a proxy foursome conversation to watch 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.810
 boxes 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 but then with a sort of ferhat 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.140
 I like to start the day with a nice cup of tea 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.230

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.919
 when I have finally used his promise, I will gladly go for the 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.750
 sluiskolk posters plus the astridpark my favorite producers of a couple 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.040
 discovered years ago 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.969
 and sprinkle some of it to pick up the roots 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.369
 and the victory through your hair and get your house right 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.369
 tried in many different brands but I think this is really best so far 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:42.479
 next to the working day a man is started then the standard is placed and a headline 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.129
 next to the computer 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.099

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.419

 Kinect's work is about having played Cambrai minutes 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.750
 once 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.829
 in good weather but since a few years slash and sensation abbas blocks with a 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.080
 wonderful scent 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.190

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.039
 and I just update you very well 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.539

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.900
 in china they must inform 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.919
 if you are only in this year's ai and in candles, then you can 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.919
 That soon became annoyed to spread 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.870
 we are of course a time completely trapped, but it is all about one 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.240
 received a birthday card instead of a 4 2 th congratulation 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.370
 and with these plastic postcards especially if you are someone or a smile 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.930
 her face will conjure these are cards through the website and fast 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.479
 I will say that quiet days but where is it actually quite a whole 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.460
 busy days and I think it was nice to conquer the car on the couch 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.669
 with a nice wait for them like this one of the past also in various the 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.430
 American stock exchanges 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.250
 so basically it was and I find it very easy to use and then you can 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.849
 that a penny here 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.719
 And with a bit of falling in love in Singapore, the series is going great 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.259
 to relax and watch 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.509

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.930
 find some to cleanse yourself 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.159
 then a nice day precedes 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.939
 to apply night cream like this no from a favorite mario brand 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:33.870
 gifts come 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.539

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.599

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.110

 to see this more after the great success of the man 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.120
 what has been around in the neighborhood report and I hope the people 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.030
 who would receive the boat and be very happy with it and if you see it too 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.620
