00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
lots of compartments so this is going to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150 
lots of compartments so this is going to
really<00:00:36.420> test<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.260> earthquake<00:00:37.829> spells

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
really test out the earthquake spells

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.760 
really test out the earthquake spells
and<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.059> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.300> open<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.320> inner

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and I really want to open up the inner

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.250 
and I really want to open up the inner
layer<00:00:40.980> walling<00:00:41.660> because<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.079> through

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
layer walling because we can get through

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
layer walling because we can get through
that<00:00:43.379> first<00:00:43.649> layer<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.430> walling<00:00:44.940> easy<00:00:45.270> enough

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that first layer of walling easy enough

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.139 
that first layer of walling easy enough
with<00:00:45.930> wall<00:00:46.110> breakers<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.399> usually<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
with wall breakers it's usually just the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.400 
with wall breakers it's usually just the
inner<00:00:48.360> walling<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.840> we're<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> find

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
inner walling so we're going to find

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
inner walling so we're going to find
some<00:00:49.590> compartments<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> open<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> I'll

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
some compartments to open up and I'll

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.020 
some compartments to open up and I'll
use<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.710> earthquake<00:00:53.430> spells<00:00:53.730> they're<00:00:53.879> only

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
use for earthquake spells they're only

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
use for earthquake spells they're only
level<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.710> shows<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.160> how

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
level one so it really shows you how

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.720 
level one so it really shows you how
powerful<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.750> level<00:00:58.050> 1<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
powerful they are just at level 1 and

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
powerful they are just at level 1 and
there<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.120> break<00:01:00.449> good<00:01:00.660> through

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there we go a little break good through

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.709 
there we go a little break good through
here<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.890> also<00:01:02.640> damages<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> defense

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
here and also damages the defense

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
here and also damages the defense
structures<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> storages<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
structures but not the storages so you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.810 
structures but not the storages so you
can<00:01:05.909> no<00:01:06.030> longer<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:07.140> damaged<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.280> storages

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
can no longer get damaged the storages

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.609 
can no longer get damaged the storages
with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> earthquake<00:01:09.900> spell<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
with the earthquake spell and the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
with the earthquake spell and the
Lightning<00:01:10.890> spell<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.939> loot<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.450> those

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
Lightning spell and get loot off those

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.760 
Lightning spell and get loot off those
so<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> keep<00:01:13.229> breaking<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.740> up

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
so I'm going to keep breaking that up

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.039 
so I'm going to keep breaking that up
open<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.810> have

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.420 
open that right up there see I have
opened<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.500> compartment<00:01:17.009> where<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
opened up that compartment where the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
opened up that compartment where the
arch<00:01:17.610> Queen<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.990> i'm<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> open

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
arch Queen was and now i'm going to open

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190 
arch Queen was and now i'm going to open
the<00:01:19.860> other<00:01:20.040> compartment<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.689> open<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the other compartment so we can open it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.980 
the other compartment so we can open it
right<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.729> for<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.090> packers<00:01:24.450> heroes<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
golems to get in there so i probably

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.109 
golems to get in there so i probably
should<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.330> brought<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:28.759> maybe<00:01:29.759> like

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
maybe another pecker or something

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
maybe another pecker or something
because<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.610> inferno<00:01:33.119> tell<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.630> let's<00:01:33.840> have

find with the earthquake spells to find

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.150 
find with the earthquake spells to find
a<00:04:01.970> good<00:04:02.150> intersection<00:04:03.079> in<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.319> wall<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.130> you

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
a good intersection in the wall so you

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.509 
a good intersection in the wall so you
can<00:04:04.250> really<00:04:04.639> open<00:04:05.090> up<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:05.599> base<00:04:06.160> for<00:04:07.160> your

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
can really open up that base for your

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.970
