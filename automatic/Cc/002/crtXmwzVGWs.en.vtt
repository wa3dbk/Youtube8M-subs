charging<00:03:13.680> port<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.290> back<00:03:16.670> got<00:03:17.670> a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
charging port on the back got a

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.310 
charging port on the back got a
loudspeaker<00:03:18.450> an<00:03:19.850> eight<00:03:20.850> megapixel<00:03:21.320> camera

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
loudspeaker an eight megapixel camera

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.130 
loudspeaker an eight megapixel camera
with<00:03:22.500> dual-led<00:03:23.430> flash<00:03:25.820> so<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.150> sensation<00:03:27.989> is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
with dual-led flash so the sensation is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.120 
with dual-led flash so the sensation is
competing<00:03:28.590> with<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.250> samsung<00:03:29.850> galaxy<00:03:29.880> s2<00:03:31.130> the

sensation has two so in dim light this
dual<00:03:56.760> flash<00:03:57.060> could<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:58.110> better<00:03:58.620> than<00:03:58.890> the

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
dual flash could be better than the

galaxy s2 another key difference is the

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.360 
galaxy s2 another key difference is the
onboard<00:04:03.780> memory<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.410> has<00:04:04.650> just<00:04:05.010> one

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
onboard memory this has just one

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.580 
onboard memory this has just one
gigabyte<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.810> course<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:07.230> can<00:04:07.410> be

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
gigabyte but of course it can be

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.000 
gigabyte but of course it can be
expanded<00:04:07.860> through<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.310> microSD<00:04:09.000> slot<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
expanded through the microSD slot the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.290 
expanded through the microSD slot the
galaxy<00:04:11.010> s2<00:04:11.130> has<00:04:11.720> 16<00:04:12.720> gig<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.260> internal<00:04:13.919> memory

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
galaxy s2 has 16 gig of internal memory

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.390 
galaxy s2 has 16 gig of internal memory
on<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.990> device<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:18.140> can<00:04:19.010> also<00:04:19.190> be

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
on the device and that can also be

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.990 
on the device and that can also be
expanded<00:04:20.120> with<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.650> microSD<00:04:21.650> so<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.460> terms<00:04:22.820> of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
expanded with a microSD so in terms of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.410 
expanded with a microSD so in terms of
memory<00:04:23.390> capacity<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.470> galaxy<00:04:24.980> s2<00:04:25.420> outweighs

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
memory capacity the galaxy s2 outweighs

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.440 
memory capacity the galaxy s2 outweighs
on<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:27.560> one<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.670> they<00:04:28.790> just<00:04:28.820> show<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.180> how<00:04:29.390> to

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
on that one so they just show you how to

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.840 
on that one so they just show you how to
remove<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.200> back<00:04:30.620> cover<00:04:30.650> it's<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.550> bit<00:04:31.730> unusual

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
remove the back cover it's a bit unusual

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.850 
remove the back cover it's a bit unusual
on<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.480> one<00:04:32.690> or<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.990> bottom<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.470> device<00:04:33.680> is

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
on this one or the bottom the device is

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.980 
on this one or the bottom the device is
a<00:04:33.890> little<00:04:34.190> button<00:04:34.400> now<00:04:35.180> rather<00:04:35.420> than<00:04:35.600> just<00:04:35.840> the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
a little button now rather than just the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.590 
a little button now rather than just the
back<00:04:36.230> cover<00:04:36.590> popping<00:04:37.280> off<00:04:37.460> we<00:04:38.090> actually<00:04:38.390> have

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
back cover popping off we actually have

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.840 
back cover popping off we actually have
sort<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.590> whole<00:04:39.800> case<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.430> comes<00:04:40.640> off

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
sort of the whole case and it comes off

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.810 
sort of the whole case and it comes off
with<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.120> sensation<00:04:41.950> so<00:04:42.950> for<00:04:43.190> just<00:04:43.370> take<00:04:43.640> that

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
with the sensation so for just take that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.620 
with the sensation so for just take that
off<00:04:44.000> there<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:45.370> we<00:04:46.370> can<00:04:46.550> see<00:04:47.080> we've<00:04:48.080> got<00:04:48.110> a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
off there and we can see we've got a

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.320 
off there and we can see we've got a
1520<00:04:50.630> milliamp<00:04:51.440> hour<00:04:51.680> battery<00:04:53.710> also<00:04:55.330> included

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
1520 milliamp hour battery also included

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.130 
1520 milliamp hour battery also included
is<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.840> micro<00:04:57.530> SD<00:04:57.710> card<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.640> 8<00:04:59.240> gigabyte<00:04:59.870> in

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
is a micro SD card of 8 gigabyte in

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.960 
is a micro SD card of 8 gigabyte in
capacity<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:04.340> that's<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.610> back<00:05:04.790> of<00:05:04.910> the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
capacity so that's the back of the

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.250 
capacity so that's the back of the
device<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.240> if<00:05:05.450> we<00:05:05.540> just<00:05:05.690> take<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.930> look<00:05:06.230> here

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
device and if we just take a look here

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.320 
device and if we just take a look here
you<00:05:06.620> see<00:05:06.830> got<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.130> cover<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:08.060> when<00:05:08.210> you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
you see got the cover and when you

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.090 
you see got the cover and when you
remove<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.870> it's<00:05:09.020> actually<00:05:09.140> taking<00:05:09.650> off<00:05:09.830> what

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
remove it it's actually taking off what

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.350 
remove it it's actually taking off what
would<00:05:10.220> normally<00:05:10.370> be<00:05:10.580> some<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.090> front

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
would normally be some of the front

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.010 
would normally be some of the front
fascia<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.860> machines<00:05:13.340> so<00:05:13.730> this<00:05:14.630> is<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.780> more

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
fascia of the machines so this is a more

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.330 
fascia of the machines so this is a more
comprehensive<00:05:15.730> back<00:05:16.730> cover<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:18.100> you<00:05:19.100> can't

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
comprehensive back cover so you can't

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.890 
comprehensive back cover so you can't
really<00:05:19.430> operate<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.150> phone<00:05:20.360> without<00:05:20.540> this

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
really operate the phone without this

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:30.780 
really operate the phone without this
actual<00:05:21.320> cover<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:22.220> goes<00:05:22.490> back<00:05:23.090> on<00:05:27.550> like<00:05:28.550> so

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
actual cover just goes back on like so

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.970 
actual cover just goes back on like so
so<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:31.880> HTC<00:05:32.450> sensation<00:05:33.200> is<00:05:33.350> available<00:05:33.740> online

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
so the HTC sensation is available online

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:40.090 
so the HTC sensation is available online
at<00:05:34.580> close<00:05:34.940> co<00:05:35.600> uk<00:05:36.260> today<00:05:36.940> thanks<00:05:37.940> for<00:05:38.030> watching
