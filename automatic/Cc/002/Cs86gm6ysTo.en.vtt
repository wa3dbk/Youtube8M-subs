00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello everyone I'm the gas 361 I bring 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.339
 this video and this time I have commented 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.200
 the call of duty ghosts the second video 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.910
 of the three that I'm going to upload today and also 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.730
 of it the second of the four maps 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.590
 which includes the tlc oms loud of call of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.420
 duty ghosts obviously and good 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.590
 I also have to say that I have not done it 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.510
 in the previous video if you are 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.130
 listening to different is because I'm not 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.230
 using the helmets that I usually use 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.840
 habitually sorry to record because 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.720
 well, because as I said 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.110
 I went yesterday to london on the 26th the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.460
 Sunday and when I came back well when 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.780
 we were right there sorry I was told 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.940
 that I could upload these gameplays on 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.100
 day 27 I thought I was going to be able 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.660
 upload them on the 28th because I did not know very 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.579
 well when he left the dlc he did not have it very 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.170
 clear and good because that's why I do not 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.579
 I took helmets like I usually do when 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.800
 I'm going on a trip that always methods 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.720
 in the suitcase but good my failure well 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.370
 that I am not commenting with others 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.739
 helmets I think they are a laser crack in 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.600
 if I'm not wrong but good is heard 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.070
 very well but it is what has been the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.320
 microphone as it is not very good 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.210
 but well that does not happen because I 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.189
 I think that I think that I am 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.749
 listening more or less decent not like 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.070
 always but good inside what fits if 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.900
 A) Yes 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.390
 here we are on the second map of how 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.640
 come is edito is a is a town 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.290
 Mexican with the one in which sorry there is a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 bridge in the middle 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.610
 with a cistern with toxic elements or 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.900
 radioactive as you want to call it no no 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.580
 it's the same there are people mind but good 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.619
 I think they are radioactive elements and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 here you are seeing there the symbol in the 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.880
 minimap for that same not the symbol 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.530
 radioactive and there's a pretty area 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.180
 conflictive right now I just launched 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.950
 a grenade to finish the person who 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.450
 to end forgiveness with the person who 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.220
 I was just doing that and that's 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.410
 there is a kind of truck destroyed 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.930
 anchored to the bridge itself with debris 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.660
 in which it is very easy to do ged glynn 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.580
 there is also this part east inside 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.950
 from the tank truck below you can 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.660
 see when it happens to people or if it falls apart 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.100
 and to the CV I would be able to finish 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.229
 with them no but good here where I am 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.700
 right now that was just that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.550
 truck that was being discussed is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.810
 quite pretty conflicting because if 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.670
 there is someone very good playing out there 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.619
 that in fact in the game there was 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.780
 there was good one of the people who 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.610
 he was in the championship cove sorry 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.989
 the world championship that is to say of the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.790
 world's best players indeed 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.129
 I think it was one of the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.079
 of the finalists if I remember correctly and 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.260
 well, there was also another person 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.420
 that was very good with the sniper was his 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.799
 channel I think it's sniper and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.840
 others I think he makes montages of 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.060
 sniper and which was made a 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.810
 triple low using that hit and leeds 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.239
 with the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.670
 with the sniper no yes it is true that 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.409
 good you can kill people 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.569
 that are put on that delete axis with a 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.500
 grenade or trying to shoot him more or 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.319
 less to the head although it 's more 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.090
 obviously complicated he has 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.040
 greater marks so to speak as you 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.439
 can point to the whole body but still 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.819
 well I tell you that it is quite enough 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.870
 complicated like this that someone good 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.579
 in sg dink 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.980
 so you can go pretty bad yes it is 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.379
 true also that this map is my 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.120
 favorite of the 4 that I tried because I 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.930
 I think it's the most dynamic 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.090
 you are constantly killing people or 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.129
 they kill you evidently depending on 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.870
 how do you play I already know that I am not a 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.040
 great player and therefore therefore in this 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.859
 occasion I used once more 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.269
 highlights of two games the first 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.120
 I think it was low confirmed if not 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.280
 I remember badly and the other one I do not know if it was a 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.530
 domination I do not know no I'm not at all 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.120
 sure but well there I'm launching the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.920
 package which does not 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.500
 I've put it as finished thing but I 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.239
 they steal, they steal me because good 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.920
 it was pretty clear I have not thrown it 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.069
 there when you go through the bridge you see 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.720
 aluminum flare but good that 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.310
 tell you the truth is that I had a very 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.620
 well in the event and I imagine that already 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.150
 I will upload also a kind of blog the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.069
 which I have not been able to upload before because 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.019
 It also had a seizure date and it was not 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.790
 I could upload before this same day but 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.920
 well I think it's better that you see 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.329
 first the maps so I do not expect anything 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.829
 that you have already tasted milk 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.390
 favorites if you want to tell me also in 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.459
 the comments what do you want the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.799
 next video uploading of the three maps 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.470
 that remain although I believe that ignition 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.690
 which is one of the four maps I'll leave 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.940
 for tomorrow next to the extension mode 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.459
 next to that night falls map because 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.930
 home the truth is that it is one that is 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.849
 quite curious because it is set 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.650
 in scrap jazz by Carlos last of the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.879
 bales but good though I hope that 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.980
 you liked it already you know like and 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.170
 favorites and with nothing more to say is 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.890
 say goodbye 360 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.890
 until next time
