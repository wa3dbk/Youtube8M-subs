00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.750 

because<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.230> will<00:01:21.380> tear<00:01:21.650> when<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.280> roll<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.610> if

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
because it will tear when you roll it if

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.630 
because it will tear when you roll it if
they're<00:01:22.910> not<00:01:23.060> filled<00:01:23.390> properly<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:25.520> was

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
they're not filled properly and I was

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.040 
they're not filled properly and I was
measuring<00:01:26.120> it<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.540> said<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:26.960> it

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
measuring it there it said that it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.110 
measuring it there it said that it
should<00:01:27.170> be<00:01:27.260> 14<00:01:27.680> by<00:01:27.830> 7<00:01:28.190> inches<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.520> this<00:01:28.880> one<00:01:29.030> is

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
should be 14 by 7 inches and this one is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.300 
should be 14 by 7 inches and this one is
a<00:01:29.180> little<00:01:29.300> bit<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.690> small<00:01:29.930> side<00:01:30.190> then<00:01:31.190> you

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
a little bit on the small side then you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.830 
a little bit on the small side then you
spread<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.790> cooled<00:01:32.030> mixture<00:01:32.540> over<00:01:32.840> top<00:01:37.840> right

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
spread the cooled mixture over top right

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.710 
spread the cooled mixture over top right
up<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> edges<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:41.300> then<00:01:41.420> you're<00:01:41.570> going<00:01:41.660> to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
up to the edges and then you're going to

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.200 
up to the edges and then you're going to
roll<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.050> up<00:01:42.080> from<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.040> long<00:01:43.220> side<00:01:45.610> now<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.970> had

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
roll it up from the long side now I had

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.940 
roll it up from the long side now I had
a<00:01:47.240> really<00:01:47.570> hard<00:01:47.780> time<00:01:47.960> rolling<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.410> up<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
a really hard time rolling this up the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.650 
a really hard time rolling this up the
mixture<00:01:49.310> wasn't<00:01:49.730> quite<00:01:49.910> cool<00:01:50.150> enough<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.480> guess

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
mixture wasn't quite cool enough I guess

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.660 
mixture wasn't quite cool enough I guess
I<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.500> only<00:01:51.680> way<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.830> really<00:01:51.980> do<00:01:52.190> this<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.550> if

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
I the only way to really do this is if

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.400 
I the only way to really do this is if
the<00:01:52.760> mixture<00:01:53.030> was<00:01:53.180> very<00:01:53.540> very<00:01:53.810> cool<00:01:54.170> because

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
the mixture was very very cool because

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.070 
the mixture was very very cool because
the<00:01:55.370> crescent<00:01:55.790> rolls<00:01:55.820> began<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.840> soften

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
the crescent rolls began to soften

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.050 
the crescent rolls began to soften
immediately<00:01:57.710> as<00:01:57.920> soon<00:01:58.340> as<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.490> try<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.730> turn

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
immediately as soon as you try to turn

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.090 
immediately as soon as you try to turn
it<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.330> ripping<00:01:59.870> like<00:02:00.050> crazy<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:00.890> was<00:02:01.070> a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
it is ripping like crazy so this was a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.550 
it is ripping like crazy so this was a
bit<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.460> pain<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.210> neck<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.690> roll<00:02:03.380> this

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
bit of a pain in the neck to roll this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960 
bit of a pain in the neck to roll this
up<00:02:03.740> because<00:02:03.860> all<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.460> seams<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.820> I've

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
up because all the seams that I've

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.720 
up because all the seams that I've
filled<00:02:05.210> up<00:02:05.390> started<00:02:05.720> coming<00:02:05.990> apart<00:02:06.260> so<00:02:07.160> cool

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
filled up started coming apart so cool

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.450 
filled up started coming apart so cool
mixture<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:09.560> larger<00:02:09.980> crescent<00:02:10.310> rolls

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
mixture and a larger crescent rolls

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.500 
mixture and a larger crescent rolls
probably<00:02:10.850> would<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.030> done<00:02:11.180> that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
probably would have done that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.590 
probably would have done that
done<00:02:12.490> what<00:02:13.490> it<00:02:13.580> should<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.760> done<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.450> says

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
done what it should have done so it says

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.090 
done what it should have done so it says
you<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.900> put<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.110> seam<00:02:15.320> side<00:02:15.530> down<00:02:15.590> but

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
you just put a seam side down but

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.470 
you just put a seam side down but
there's<00:02:16.280> no<00:02:16.490> way<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.940> could<00:02:17.150> turn<00:02:17.330> this

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
there's no way that I could turn this

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.940 
there's no way that I could turn this
over<00:02:17.660> without<00:02:17.960> ripping<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.410> pieces<00:02:18.650> and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
over without ripping it to pieces and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.190 
over without ripping it to pieces and
you're<00:02:19.910> supposed<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.150> bake<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.540> at<00:02:20.690> 400

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
you're supposed to bake it at 400

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.410 
you're supposed to bake it at 400
degrees<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:21.890> 20<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> 25<00:02:22.730> minutes<00:02:22.940> until<00:02:23.120> it's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until it's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.199 
degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until it's
golden<00:02:23.780> brown<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.739> did<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.100> baked<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.700> 400

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
golden brown so I did I baked it 400

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.720 
golden brown so I did I baked it 400
until<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.570> was<00:02:26.720> golden<00:02:27.050> brown<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
until it was golden brown and the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.610 
until it was golden brown and the
exterior<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.600> was<00:02:29.720> cooked<00:02:30.110> quite<00:02:30.380> nicely

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
exterior of it was cooked quite nicely

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.390 
exterior of it was cooked quite nicely
but<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.220> found<00:02:31.520> was<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:33.110> dough<00:02:34.070> that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
but what I found was that the dough that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.460 
but what I found was that the dough that
was<00:02:34.580> curled<00:02:34.940> inside<00:02:35.600> there<00:02:35.959> when<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.230> roll<00:02:36.440> it

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
was curled inside there when you roll it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.340 
was curled inside there when you roll it
up<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:37.250> kind<00:02:37.520> of<00:02:37.700> kind<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.480> mushy<00:02:39.080> and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
up was kind of kind of mushy and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.070 
up was kind of kind of mushy and
uncooked<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.280> still<00:02:40.520> tasted<00:02:40.970> okay<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:42.050> I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
uncooked it still tasted okay but I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.160 
uncooked it still tasted okay but I
think<00:02:42.410> maybe<00:02:42.860> baking<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.550> at<00:02:43.730> say<00:02:44.060> trees<00:02:44.360> 350

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
think maybe baking it at say trees 350

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.590 
think maybe baking it at say trees 350
to<00:02:45.260> 375<00:02:45.470> for<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> little<00:02:46.580> bit<00:02:46.700> longer<00:02:46.850> would

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
to 375 for a little bit longer would

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.420 
to 375 for a little bit longer would
give<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.140> filling<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.770> chance<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.220> heat

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
give it the filling a chance to heat

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.699 
give it the filling a chance to heat
enough<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.820> cook<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.450> dough<00:02:50.660> that's<00:02:51.110> inside

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
enough to cook the dough that's inside

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.490 
enough to cook the dough that's inside
there<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.750> does<00:02:53.930> taste<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.380> a

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
there so it does taste like a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.460 
there so it does taste like a
cheeseburger<00:02:54.800> though<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.550> part<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.090> true<00:02:56.470> so

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
cheeseburger though that part is true so

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.150 
cheeseburger though that part is true so
it's<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.250> quick<00:02:58.580> easy<00:02:58.910> meal<00:02:59.739> when<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:00.770> make<00:03:01.010> it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
it's a quick easy meal when I make it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.190 
it's a quick easy meal when I make it
again<00:03:01.430> I'm<00:03:01.700> not<00:03:02.300> sure<00:03:02.870> about<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:05.050> there<00:03:06.050> you

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
again I'm not sure about that there you

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.380 
again I'm not sure about that there you
go
