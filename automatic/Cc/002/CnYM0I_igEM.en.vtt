00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.700
 So I'm hungry, I have bananas 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.320
 from suite 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.720
 these known new yorker cobbler 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.340
 list a fancy quick recipe and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.770
 The weekend is just around the corner 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.419
 So enough reasons for a banana co to 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.640
 I want to start baking right away 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.540
 this time without the individual ingredients too 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.380
 celebrate 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.270
 but I will say something later 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.090
 we count the same or the whole 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.920
 Successively three bananas give this in 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.109
 a bowl of bowl or deep plate 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.109
 and crush it with a fork 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.430
 then the delicious bananas pampa 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.170
 first to the side and if 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.170
 this should be needed is that 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.570
 no problem at all 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.609
 Now we go to a bowl of flour 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.079
 7 the baking powder over it and mix 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.640
 do everything together in one 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.830
 other bowl we give the soft 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.800
 Mull the butter, this look me 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.880
 grim and then leave on further 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.170
 stir in the sugar as well 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.460
 then we proceed with the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.890
 vanilla sugar then we add one more 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.210
 Added teaspoonful of cinnamon and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.220
 work this too and you and 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.670
 we give a total of three eggs in these 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.070
 mixture in succession and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.790
 Stir it thoroughly every single one 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.869
 before we give the next one 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.600
 in the next step go like 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.240
 step by step the mixture 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.490
 and the prepared bananas in the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.340
 bowl in with it always on 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.649
 stir until the entire mixture and all 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.600
 bananas incorporated in the dough and 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.860
 thoroughly mulled are now ready 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.990
 we make a mold 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.880
 By the way, the cake is not very noticeable 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.829
 So you can also make a small form 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.840
 I prefer to take a big one 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.649
 do you have cake a little flatter and that 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.660
 I like it better 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.729
 We would have one and then 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.360
 sprinkle with them all around 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.349
 grated coco when this is done 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.430
 we distribute the dough in the form 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.980
 maybe they can cancel something 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.250
 smooth and then off with it in the oven and 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.080
 while at 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.180
 Circulated at 190 degrees 175 degrees for about 50 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.130
 minutes mainly observed to the very end in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.200
 the cake and if so something to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.790
 seems to be dark then it covers him 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.290
 with some aluminum foil 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.850
 I have this for the last one 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.560
 quarter of an hour so done the finished 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.630
 we leave baked cake 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.260
 then completely in the form 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.209
 cooling down 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.760
 now we have the chocolate kiss 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.950
 prepare melt in a water bath 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.080
 about 100 grams of tender bitter chocolate 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.910
 more and more stirring and on it 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.530
 Pay attention that the water does not track 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.300
 Nothing is cooked in the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.070
 chocolate gets when they do 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.200
 we are still melting 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.820
 a tablespoon of butter with little ones too 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.910
 these melt and everything smooth 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.470
 mix with each other and now comes the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.880
 chocolate kiss on the cake 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.040
 Of course you can do this too 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.020
 evenly with a brush 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.910
 I like it but I like it 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.190
 variant better that gives the whole 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.720
 a slightly rustic painting me 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.180
 he likes visually very good and tastes 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.230
 also excellent short still the sentence too 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.640
 the ingredients 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.980
 you are so used to it that I am 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.870
 the beginning of this begins with the words we 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.850
 need to introduce 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.130
 the question is is that really useful 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.110
 because in the video itself you see the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.390
 individual ingredients and with the exact 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.820
 quantities you will find them anyway 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.769
 the infobox my consideration if this 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.299
 sequence in the beginning stays away we can 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.370
 us faster the actual fact 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.110
 to be able to prepare if you had to 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.350
 has a little in this regard 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.120
 feedback I would be really grateful so and 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.079
 Now I wish you much fun 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.880
 Bake and then enjoy your meal 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.519
 if something else with bananas 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.799
 to prepare eg a banana bread 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.930
 or even banana muffins then looks 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.120
 but just into these videos 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.010
 I still have to say until the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.010
 next time
