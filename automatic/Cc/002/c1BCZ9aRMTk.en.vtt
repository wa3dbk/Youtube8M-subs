I'm<00:01:14.120> not<00:01:14.300> sure<00:01:14.450> why<00:01:14.630> SteelSeries<00:01:15.170> went<00:01:15.320> for

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
I'm not sure why SteelSeries went for

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.990 
I'm not sure why SteelSeries went for
this<00:01:15.500> Clear<00:01:15.740> button<00:01:15.800> although<00:01:16.610> they<00:01:16.729> remove

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
this Clear button although they remove

the<00:01:17.150> LCD<00:01:17.299> compared<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.020> regular<00:01:18.170> sensei<00:01:18.680> I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the LCD compared to the regular sensei I

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.020 
the LCD compared to the regular sensei I
think<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.220> really<00:01:19.340> detract<00:01:19.670> from<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.970> overall

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
think it really detract from the overall

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.850 
think it really detract from the overall
design<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:21.110> black<00:01:21.320> button<00:01:21.620> would<00:01:21.740> have

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
design and a black button would have

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.830 
design and a black button would have
sufficed<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.400> this<00:01:22.549> case<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.360> has<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.630> roar

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840

comes with a nylon braided cable which
is<00:01:25.790> great<00:01:26.180> for<00:01:26.390> protecting<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.810> cable<00:01:27.110> from

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
is great for protecting the cable from

these correspond to the LED on the top
of<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.520> mouse<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.389> see<00:04:56.570> although<00:04:56.780> we<00:04:56.960> and

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
of the mouse you can see although we and

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.650 
of the mouse you can see although we and
today<00:04:57.289> I<00:04:57.440> entered<00:04:57.650> CPI<00:04:58.250> he<00:04:58.580> actually<00:04:59.000> fixed<00:04:59.539> it

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
today I entered CPI he actually fixed it

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.719 
today I entered CPI he actually fixed it
to<00:04:59.840> Android<00:05:00.139> and<00:05:00.259> ten<00:05:00.440> this<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:00.979> because<00:05:01.400> the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
to Android and ten this is because the

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.420 
to Android and ten this is because the
sensor<00:05:02.240> actually<00:05:02.419> goes<00:05:02.900> in<00:05:03.110> ninety<00:05:03.590> CPI<00:05:04.010> steps

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
sensor actually goes in ninety CPI steps

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.010 
sensor actually goes in ninety CPI steps
so<00:05:05.030> go<00:05:05.240> 810<00:05:06.340> 909<00:05:07.340> 90<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:07.820> so<00:05:07.850> on<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.690> can<00:05:08.840> see

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
so go 810 909 90 and so on you can see

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.170 
so go 810 909 90 and so on you can see
also<00:05:09.350> we<00:05:09.560> can<00:05:09.710> set<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.070> pulsation<00:05:10.699> and<00:05:10.820> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
also we can set the pulsation and the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.850 
also we can set the pulsation and the
elimination<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.169> mouse<00:05:12.320> as<00:05:12.530> well<00:05:12.680> as<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
elimination of the mouse as well as the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.100 
elimination of the mouse as well as the
polling<00:05:13.190> rate<00:05:13.340> still<00:05:14.270> series<00:05:14.539> have<00:05:14.660> taken<00:05:14.900> 30

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
polling rate still series have taken 30

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
polling rate still series have taken 30
pounds<00:05:15.440> off<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.650> price<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.039> regular

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
pounds off the price of the regular

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.950 
pounds off the price of the regular
since<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.699> taken<00:05:17.120> out<00:05:17.210> some<00:05:17.389> parts<00:05:17.780> and

disabled some of the software but does
that<00:05:20.180> mean<00:05:20.360> you're<00:05:20.479> left<00:05:20.630> with<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.780> crippled
