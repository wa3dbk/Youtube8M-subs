00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.470 
really similar to Apple home button
that's<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.840> all<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.490> uh<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:32.120> think<00:02:32.270> a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
that's of all that is uh I think a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.920 
that's of all that is uh I think a
microUSB<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:33.410> charging<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:35.180> stuff<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.480> this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
microUSB for charging this stuff on this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.600 
microUSB for charging this stuff on this
device

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
device

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.490 
device
let's<00:02:37.610> see<00:02:37.760> what<00:02:37.940> else<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.450> think<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:39.410> a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
let's see what else I think that's a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.000 
let's see what else I think that's a
that's<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.700> indicator<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.959> we<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.770> normal

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
that's a indicator and we get a normal

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.390 
that's a indicator and we get a normal
USB<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:44.480> get<00:02:44.630> some<00:02:44.810> branding<00:02:45.320> over<00:02:45.500> here

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
USB you get some branding over here

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.840 
USB you get some branding over here
you<00:02:46.910> know<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.050> nothing<00:02:48.470> on<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.739> side<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.220> on

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
you know and nothing on this side and on

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.440 
you know and nothing on this side and on
this<00:02:50.180> side<00:02:50.239> as<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.660> said<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.110> microUSB<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.450> I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
this side as I said the microUSB and I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.030 
this side as I said the microUSB and I
don't<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.110> just<00:02:54.350> check<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.709> out<00:02:54.770> what

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
don't have to just check it out what

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.160 
don't have to just check it out what
these<00:02:55.220> bottoms<00:02:55.640> are<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.480> know<00:02:56.570> really<00:02:56.900> meant

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
for so you know to really see how it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.890 
for so you know to really see how it
really<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.070> I'll<00:03:01.940> be<00:03:02.300> connecting<00:03:02.720> some

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
really is I'll be connecting some

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.770 
really is I'll be connecting some
devices<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.650> we'll<00:03:04.220> see<00:03:04.459> how<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.640> works<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.750> I

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
devices and we'll see how it works so I

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.890 
devices and we'll see how it works so I
just<00:03:05.959> went<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.350> it's<00:03:06.489> working<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.790> what<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.780> is

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
just went to it's working and what it is

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.680 
just went to it's working and what it is
is<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.320> we<00:03:10.160> gotta<00:03:10.370> connect<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.820> USB<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.540> we

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
is that we gotta connect this USB and we

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.840 
is that we gotta connect this USB and we
get<00:03:11.810> this<00:03:12.019> female<00:03:12.580> so<00:03:13.580> let's<00:03:14.360> see<00:03:15.370> no<00:03:16.370> it's

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
get this female so let's see no it's

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.229 
get this female so let's see no it's
gonna<00:03:17.030> connect<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.600> here<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:19.010> go<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:20.180> we

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
gonna connect it here we go and now we

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.640 
gonna connect it here we go and now we
can<00:03:20.480> enter<00:03:20.690> our<00:03:21.280> device<00:03:22.280> why<00:03:22.610> this

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
can enter our device why this

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.140 
can enter our device why this
proprietary<00:03:24.650> connection<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.760> I'll<00:03:25.850> just<00:03:26.000> show

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
proprietary connection so I'll just show

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.300 
proprietary connection so I'll just show
you<00:03:26.180> for<00:03:26.630> an<00:03:26.750> example<00:03:27.110> where's<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.890> 30-pin

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
you for an example where's the 30-pin

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.240 
you for an example where's the 30-pin
you're<00:03:29.090> after<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.540> 30<00:03:29.840> pin<00:03:30.080> connector<00:03:30.320> as<00:03:31.160> you

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
you're after the 30 pin connector as you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.300 
you're after the 30 pin connector as you
can<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:31.549> it's<00:03:31.640> got<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:31.940> proprietary

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
can see it's got that proprietary

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.199 
can see it's got that proprietary
connector<00:03:34.310> right<00:03:34.430> there<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:34.880> it's<00:03:35.060> gonna

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
connector right there so it's gonna

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.250 
connector right there so it's gonna
connect<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:36.049> thing<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:37.010> man<00:03:37.730> if<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.630> can<00:03:38.690> and
