 characteristics are unique and the beauty 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.270
 of the beaches make it the main 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.250

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.390

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.170
 put in the mouth 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.160
 He will breathe through it with everything. 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.350
 organized 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.020
 wait for the boat that will 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.690
 drive to the ideal place to meet 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.150
 the core of baptism down there 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.140
 we will find a wide variety of 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.510
 fish 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.400
 You have Argentines neon, the one who 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.830
 you see more than a lot of shoals 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.760

 species of fish that have more with their 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.590
 people had and the two lines up 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.869
 type of water is the kind of seaweed they 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.460
 also eat the depth is that you 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.390
 saw that it is no more than six meters 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.100
 depth 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.710
 super controlled professional time 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.020

 fire coral brain also has here 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.940
 in this region to fall into the water some 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.770
 equipment is required that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.460
 we use the fins we put 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.320
 on the feet 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.750
 We wore a vest called a vest 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.090
 the cylinder where you will have the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.649
 your air there for you breathing regulator 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.240
 that whole set that was 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.060
 scrambled like an astronaut calls 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.640
 sorry for the stand-alone equipment and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.500
 We also wear a diving mask. 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.690
 to view the fish would lead 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.930
 the mask would be virtually impossible 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.880
 to see all the trash is down there 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.800
 the instructions we still get in 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.720
 earth here on the move we'll get 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.290
 all equipment the oxygen cylinder 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.600
 that finally dive and see the corals 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.850
 all natural beauty that port of 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.010
 chickens soon after testing the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.069
 equipment and receive a quick workout 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.600
 how much underwater breathing comes 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.600
 the time to explore the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.040
 look at the famous sargentinho if they have 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.709
 the slightly oval body flattened with 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.590
 five black bars vertically over 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.340
 color background ranging from light yellow 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.769
 to the orange the name sergeant is due to the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.010
 bars that resemble the insignia 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.519
 military personnel generally measure 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.829
 8 to 15 centimeters in length 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.950
 the two lines are found with 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.859
 frequency very close to corals only 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.799
 fish that do not grow very high at most 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.430
 they reach 13 centimeters so 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.069
 occurs in areas relatively fast 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.439
 the feeling is wonderful 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.889
 the introduction is that the world to 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.519
 while the warm water and silence 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.980
 landscape make the will of 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.560
 turn a fish and never leave the water 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.439
 anyone with good health and 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.450
 reasonable physical 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.900
 perform the activity 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.959
 the minimum age allowed is 8 years and 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.569
 children need to swim 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.419
 there is no maximum age 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.599
 some feared traumas found in the 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.930
 The overcoming of diving was really cool. 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.789
 I liked to see the fish and the first 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.400
 it was kind of like this oil is because I 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:28.229
 I do not know how to swim or anything, it was cool. 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.090
 back to back and promenade and harbor 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.650
 of chickens I have never immersed myself in 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.380
 My life was the first time I 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.349
 I dived in with my wife who 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.710
 I had a phobia of water and I did not imagine 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:43.080
 which was an extremely delicious thing and 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.909
 we just got out of the water 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.280
 I am wanting to go back again there for 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.650
 All the fear goes away when 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.789
 is under water the care is 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.229
 simple and dot with a breath below 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.280
 with customers is always 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.229
 breathing 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.440
 I never discarded anything on account of 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.270
 preserve nature and if I 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.070
 going to follow the instructions 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.120
 I calm myself diving this 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.710
 experience only the good memories remain 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.790
 Wonderful dive eating procopa 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.040

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.330
 and came here because it is very good gives 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.450
 good memories of harbor of chickens 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:23.250
 here of the place of nature of people and 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.240
