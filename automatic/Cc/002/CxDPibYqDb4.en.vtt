00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.870
 and to address this issue we are accompanied by 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.720
 website director 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.670
 the spy digital.com juan antonio 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 Aguilar from Madrid or the action 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.040
 rent like this and thanks for 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.080
 accompany us 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 I want to ask you good the signing of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.819
 this mentioned agreement as it would favor 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.119
 the bilateral relations of both 

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:20.119
 countries 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.350
 Well, no doubt that this agreement is 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.990
 the Russian response to interference and 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.080
 accidental for the Ukrainian business and 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.450
 also logically it greatly favors 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.060
 part a lot to Chinese politics in the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.650
 peaceful in the extreme cia 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.950
 well this agreement has a character 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.360
 strategic and goes far beyond the 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.660
 economic figures 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.630
 it is true that the gas agreement 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.000
 gigantic are 430 billion euros 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.280
 counting investments for three 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.170
 decades but there are many more agreements 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.780
 from civil association and energy 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.630
 nuclear technology the function of 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.090
 borders 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.050
 tremendous is an agreement clearly of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.970
 strategic character that is established is 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:17.640
 a potentiality in what is axial 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.920
 of a pleasure of a little hand is 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.150
 incalculable right now but there 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.470
 parts of the agreement that are so 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.180
 important what happens is that it 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.570
 listen to two are important to the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.930
 global equilibrium for example the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.560
 intention to stop exchanges 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.450
 commercial in maldÃ¡ national currencies 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.330
 not using the dollar what this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 greatly harms the already battered 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.969
 North American economy 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.610
 or the strategic agreement 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.479
 for the military operation that is going to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.880
 watch 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.289
 boosted next year and which 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.710
 they intend to build actions 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:02.689
 helicopters in the end I think it's a 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.390
 historical contribution is a setting 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:09.660
 mean in a clear rebalancing 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.009
 international and surely their 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.840
 consequences 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.840
 we were not even shine it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.880
 well I also want to ask you sir 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.410
 Aguilar the community wonders 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.200
 precisely the gas transfer 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.730
 Russian to the Asian giant would affect the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 European consumers that so far 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.810
 because they provided a good part of their 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.720
 supply through russia 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.060
 clear is to say in this agreement that it is not 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.670
 more than the proper development of 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.520
 Ukrainian crisis the big handicapped is 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.480
 the European Union in its clumsiness or saying 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.040
 we will see the mind because the logical thing 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.190
 right is to call them in their position of 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.050
 the street or from the usa 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.030
 has gotten into a mess in a conflict 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.350
 international in which she is the great 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.900
 harmed because she is this 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.400
 depends largely between a 40 and a 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.560
 60 percent of supplies 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.560
 energetics of russia 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 clear if we start with sanctions and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.989
 threatens Russia because the logical thing is that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.170
 He looked late looking to go out to his 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.050
 markets and in this case it was very simple 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.599
 think about it were the two countries more 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.640
 villages of the Chinese and Indian world is 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.730
 saying was the logical way from the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.560
 Politically where could 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.840
 get the right answer to that 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.690
 interference and exercise provoking in their 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280
 Western borders evidently 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.069
 this is time to lose is europe 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.709
 because he demanded such finally the agreement 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.360
 of fiery chili with china to part of 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.610
 suspected oil tanker 60,000 million 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.580
 euros of dollars that closes the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.980
 agreement then logically if europe 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.349
 wants to stay in the supplies of 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.470
 the feeling that you will have to prepare them to 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.269
 a bigger profile that is to say give the great 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.730
 all this is harmed in biology 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.860
 but she has looked for it herself 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.849
 very good sir when tony aguilar from 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.080
 madrid thank you very much very much 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.080
 important point of view
