hey guys so um about this heating issue
I'm<00:00:05.649> I<00:00:05.829> am<00:00:05.979> that<00:00:06.279> the<00:00:06.759> hottest<00:00:06.970> part<00:00:07.419> is<00:00:07.660> like

something that just surprised me is I
touched<00:00:12.070> that<00:00:12.430> leave<00:00:13.390> the<00:00:13.510> wire<00:00:13.690> bad<00:00:13.930> touch

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.140 
touched that leave the wire bad touch

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.710 
touched that leave the wire bad touch
right<00:00:14.530> here<00:00:14.740> in<00:00:14.830> the<00:00:14.890> district<00:00:15.280> and<00:00:15.820> that<00:00:16.599> was

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
right here in the district and that was

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.390 
right here in the district and that was
like<00:00:16.839> really<00:00:17.050> fucking<00:00:17.529> hot<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:17.949> then<00:00:18.369> I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
like really fucking hot and then I

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.790 
like really fucking hot and then I
touched<00:00:18.730> right<00:00:18.880> here<00:00:19.210> ah<00:00:19.449> fuck<00:00:20.050> it's<00:00:20.499> still

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
touched right here ah fuck it's still

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.859 
touched right here ah fuck it's still
really<00:00:21.009> hot<00:00:21.279> and<00:00:21.640> it<00:00:21.999> was<00:00:22.150> like<00:00:22.300> hot<00:00:22.659> enough

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
really hot and it was like hot enough

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.979 
really hot and it was like hot enough
for<00:00:23.140> like<00:00:23.409> burnt<00:00:23.800> my<00:00:23.919> knuckle<00:00:24.599> so<00:00:25.599> could<00:00:25.839> it<00:00:25.929> be

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
for like burnt my knuckle so could it be

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.140 
for like burnt my knuckle so could it be
the<00:00:26.109> wire<00:00:26.289> that's<00:00:26.499> a<00:00:26.589> problem

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
the wire that's a problem

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.599 
the wire that's a problem
let's<00:00:28.150> check<00:00:28.269> this<00:00:28.390> out<00:00:28.599> we've<00:00:28.749> got<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:29.609> dual

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
let's check this out we've got a dual

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.780 
let's check this out we've got a dual
run<00:00:30.939> of<00:00:31.689> eight<00:00:31.899> gauge<00:00:32.220> so<00:00:33.220> it's<00:00:33.340> about<00:00:33.520> four

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
run of eight gauge so it's about four

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.610 
run of eight gauge so it's about four
gauge<00:00:34.000> like<00:00:34.240> I<00:00:34.330> had<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.540> trim<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.900> down<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.110> fit

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
gauge like I had to trim it down to fit

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.700 
gauge like I had to trim it down to fit
it<00:00:35.740> inside<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.520> four<00:00:36.760> gauge<00:00:38.160> new<00:00:39.180> concept

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it inside the four gauge new concept

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.220 
it inside the four gauge new concept
control<00:00:41.710> block<00:00:41.890> thing<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.970> so<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:43.840> figured<00:00:44.170> you

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
control block thing and so I figured you

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.010 
control block thing and so I figured you
know<00:00:44.290> that's<00:00:44.830> four<00:00:45.070> gauge<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.420> see<00:00:46.450> that's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
know that's four gauge and see that's

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.680 
know that's four gauge and see that's
it's<00:00:47.260> really<00:00:47.560> short<00:00:47.740> run<00:00:47.980> -<00:00:48.330> that's<00:00:49.330> as<00:00:49.480> far<00:00:49.630> as

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
it's really short run - that's as far as

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.780 
it's really short run - that's as far as
is<00:00:49.960> I<00:00:50.230> don't<00:00:50.320> know<00:00:50.500> here's<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.430> width<00:00:51.580> of<00:00:51.670> the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
is I don't know here's the width of the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.380 
is I don't know here's the width of the
amp<00:00:51.910> so<00:00:52.240> just<00:00:52.690> uh<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:53.280> don't<00:00:54.280> know<00:00:54.340> how<00:00:54.970> wide<00:00:55.240> the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
amp so just uh I don't know how wide the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.970 
amp so just uh I don't know how wide the
amp<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:56.050> much<00:00:56.230> more<00:00:56.260> than<00:00:56.560> that<00:00:56.710> and

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
amp is and that much more than that and

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.240 
amp is and that much more than that and
then<00:00:57.520> my<00:00:57.670> ground<00:00:59.700> that's<00:01:00.700> not<00:01:00.940> hot<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:03.070> god

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
then my ground that's not hot my god

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.630 
then my ground that's not hot my god
seems<00:01:03.520> fine<00:01:03.730> my<00:01:04.089> grounds<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.629> just<00:01:04.900> goes<00:01:05.080> from

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
seems fine my grounds it just goes from

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.870 
seems fine my grounds it just goes from
here<00:01:06.670> Oh<00:01:07.200> -<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.920> can't<00:01:09.130> see<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.460> right<00:01:09.700> back

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
here Oh - you can't see it right back

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.610 
here Oh - you can't see it right back
there<00:01:10.240> so<00:01:11.170> also<00:01:11.470> not<00:01:12.250> very<00:01:12.550> long<00:01:12.870> but<00:01:13.870> um<00:01:14.110> I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
there so also not very long but um I

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.380 
there so also not very long but um I
don't<00:01:15.280> know<00:01:15.400> could<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:15.640> be<00:01:15.790> something<00:01:16.030> up<00:01:16.270> with

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
don't know could it be something up with

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.510 
don't know could it be something up with
my<00:01:16.510> distro<00:01:16.840> block<00:01:17.050> if<00:01:17.590> you're<00:01:17.740> curious<00:01:18.010> this

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
my distro block if you're curious this

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.290 
my distro block if you're curious this
is<00:01:18.580> fused<00:01:19.240> at<00:01:19.650> 150<00:01:20.650> amps<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.820> should<00:01:22.000> be<00:01:22.090> plenty

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
is fused at 150 amps it should be plenty

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.210 
is fused at 150 amps it should be plenty
because<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.930> amplifier<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.560> only<00:01:23.680> fused<00:01:24.010> for

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
because the amplifier is only fused for

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.490 
because the amplifier is only fused for
140<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.470> I'm<00:01:26.650> not<00:01:26.800> sure<00:01:27.010> what's<00:01:27.220> up<00:01:27.340> here

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
140 so I'm not sure what's up here

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.719 
140 so I'm not sure what's up here
it's<00:01:29.500> pretty<00:01:29.680> warm<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.100> didn't<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.520> didn't

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
it's pretty warm it didn't it didn't

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's pretty warm it didn't it didn't
shut<00:01:30.850> off<00:01:31.000> or<00:01:31.180> anything<00:01:31.330> I've<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:31.770> went<00:01:32.770> back

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
shut off or anything I've just went back

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.140 
shut off or anything I've just went back
to<00:01:33.010> check<00:01:33.190> on<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.549> was<00:01:33.640> actually<00:01:33.729> gonna<00:01:33.970> turn

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
to check on it I was actually gonna turn

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.640 
to check on it I was actually gonna turn
the<00:01:34.299> game<00:01:34.479> down<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.720> little<00:01:34.900> bit<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.440> see

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
the game down a little bit just to see

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.190 
the game down a little bit just to see
if<00:01:35.710> they'll<00:01:35.920> help<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.840> it's<00:01:38.020> like

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
if they'll help and now it's like

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.990 
if they'll help and now it's like
vertical<00:01:38.620> which<00:01:39.280> would<00:01:39.430> be<00:01:39.520> like<00:01:39.670> four<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:39.970> a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
vertical which would be like four and a

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.539 
vertical which would be like four and a
half<00:01:40.030> volts<00:01:40.440> which<00:01:41.440> is<00:01:41.650> about<00:01:41.860> right<00:01:42.070> since<00:01:42.370> my

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
half volts which is about right since my

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.490 
half volts which is about right since my
RCA<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.150> put<00:01:43.360> out<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.510> little<00:01:43.690> bit<00:01:43.840> more<00:01:44.020> than<00:01:44.229> I

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
RCA is put out a little bit more than I

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.280 
RCA is put out a little bit more than I
look<00:01:45.460> like<00:01:45.760> yeah<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> little<00:01:46.720> bit<00:01:46.810> more<00:01:46.990> than<00:01:47.110> 4

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
look like yeah a little bit more than 4

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.670 
look like yeah a little bit more than 4
volts<00:01:47.820> somewhere<00:01:48.820> around<00:01:48.909> there<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.290> if

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
volts somewhere around there and if

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.930 
volts somewhere around there and if
you're<00:01:50.799> wondering<00:01:51.010> what<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.220> wire<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.670> this

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
you're wondering what this wire is this

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.960 
you're wondering what this wire is this
is<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.619> already<00:01:53.619> pretty<00:01:54.159> attached<00:01:54.460> ground<00:01:54.760> wire

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
is a already pretty attached ground wire
