00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello everyone today we have boxing review 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.990
 faces from the company form the floor look fight 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.380
 Do I have eggs in it and show another egg recipe 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.059
 charcoal delicious box art came out 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.920
 somewhere around 150 rubles is a company box 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.100
 You can naturally just wear eggs in 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.240
 a cardboard box with it weighs this miracle 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.880
 45 grams have the company flame maple such 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.260
 the same on more eggs 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.060
 but I have Soviet tanks this 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.450
 plastic so I decided to take myself 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.480
 on going and what we get for 45 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.910
 gram sizes here are external 72 by 52 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.090
 about egg sizes, inner diameter 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.550
 here in 48 millimeters as if 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 labor the carpenter comes in here is the same 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.570
 the length of its and here it is here 6 half 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.360
 centimeters here it is here 7 centimeters 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.649
 there are legs on the top and on the bottom 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.340
 thanks to which the egg is so versed 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.379
 a little bit and such a person is no longer here 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.840
 will close but not close 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.299
 but now burst if stronger begin 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.830
 crush so it seems to me the restriction 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.939
 in the balls here are six and half 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 centimeters see it with difficulty 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.549
 6 half centimeters maximum well and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 48 mm diameter that are hefty 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.070
 These are the chicken eggs here they are stupid 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 do not climb after the test, it turned out that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.530
 when falling on the ground from a height of thirty 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.500
 centimeters nothing happened then 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.390
 I dropped from a height of half a meter and one of the eggs 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.900
 split from this side and from this 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.930
 and another look just these legs 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.930
 struck here three very funny ones 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.570
 holes vice from country to whole that is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.369
 the legs are to blame for this 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.310
 in that I broke the egg but with 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.350
 I filed a small smart height 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.799
 something there was no knife on the record showed 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 all this 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.880
 but nothing much happened just to 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 already from a height of half a meter these legs 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.439
 struck me an egg then there are any 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.739
 wrong legs and here yes the same 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.780
 look at this egg from the legs 3 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.610
 trace 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.030
 well, like here, too, from the legs three to the left 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.940
 that is, damn that they generally cut off these 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.650
 idiotic legs in general i'm not there something 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.530
 enrolled therefore another egg laid 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.530
 and I want to drop you a few more times 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:38.690
 cock displeased everything is good once again everything 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:44.030
 okay everything is beautiful let's get higher 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:47.870
 more height judging by the sound, too, all 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.989
 well yes damn what is this magic 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.300
 enchanted plan with a meter high here 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.569
 doesn't even fit into the screen 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.190
 dropping with height in meter damn still 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:08.680
 whole what's up well let's get here with this 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:11.530
 height Well now just look spread 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.400
 yes again the legs broke 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:20.299
 quietly 5 legs broke an egg with one 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.829
 side and the second is not see she 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.739
 let's field test now 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.470
 when we can really 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.400
 need such a container 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.280
 There are several cooking methods. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.040
 the eggs on the fire is the easiest primitive 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.410
 bury eggs in the ground from above to dissolve 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.360
 a fire later when a fire burns out 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.880
 dig and eat tasty eggs 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.980
 another option is just to put the eggs in 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.380
 bonfire can put them in foil 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.600
 Well, the most interesting option is to 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.940
 potato that is, the potato is taken on 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.209
 large cut off her top 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.820
 the insides are chosen with a spoon and why 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.720
 there the egg is poured it's all foil and in 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.209
 bonfire was laid on the place of the old 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.480
 firewood hut firewood certainly not 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.640
 better but the hut he burns faster 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.070
 total from fires and now we get 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.510
 enough coals to make it all 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.510
 good baked 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:25.250
 the process slowly goes with the wind 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:28.570
 the fire burns very, very fast in 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.570
 this time let's prepare the foil and 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.570
 potatoes 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.620
 if we have some kind of living potatoes from it 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.620
 apparently here and so will have to cut 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:00.530
 here we cut out first with a knife 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:05.330
 we knock gently in order not to 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.099
 charge into the potatoes that are taken out 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:21.580
 you can then boil out of it a little and 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:24.319
 hungry time some kind of potato she 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.940
 bakes longer than the egg so potatoes 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.340
 not so much to leave well, all I 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.250
 I think enough spoon we had a form 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.710
 floor titanium knife opinel to number 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.879
 eight redone that's the top one 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.159
 part probably not baked 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:41.330
 cap 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:44.690
 give testicle we break the court and the general that I 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:48.500
 I think that of course such nonsense only I 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:53.270
 blya I can take a review and scrambled eggs pancake 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.610
 came up with what comes out but I think fans 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.669
 will look appreciate 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:03.050
 here's the eggs close we take the foil and 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:06.199
 wrap it all I'm right in the roll 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.139
 to bake a bunch of potatoes such a new 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.550
 chic 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:20.189
 so I still do not tear teeth Clan 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:22.169
 forget where Doenitz wrap on top 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.870
 time is usually baked for minutes 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:28.020
 twenty not more for more time already 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.509
 everything will turn into embers but look at 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.159
 eye of the heat if the heat of the weak 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:38.310
 respectively, more time if 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:42.509
 strong then smaller so i take off let's 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:47.389
 let's deploy and see what happened this 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.389
 glove I am very wrapped ax 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:57.319
 look at the bottom of the potato thought a 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.939
 here is the testicle 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.770
 yes baked well but the cap from 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.490
 the potatoes did not bake us a hook 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.490
 smaller 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:26.640
 but the second in softness is felt 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:31.340
 that normally everything was done in softness 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:37.290
 Potatoes on a spoon should be disclosed 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:39.090
 the walls of the potato testicle that's what 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.470
 only a thin one is left of the potato 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.270
 the skin at the same time the skin is not strong 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.420
 burnt well, the potatoes were plump 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:49.440
 wrapped foil and was in the coals well 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.140
 about a ray less than 20 minutes but she was 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.260
 not directly sprinkled on the house with rubles 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:57.870
 to about half 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:02.810
 testicle that you need nice guys all 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.810
 appetite and see you on the channel
