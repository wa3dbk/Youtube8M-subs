time you've added up all that fantastic
tech<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.950> price<00:03:58.220> tag<00:03:58.580> it's<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:59.150> bit<00:03:59.360> steep<00:03:59.780> and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
tech the price tag it's a bit steep and

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.250 
tech the price tag it's a bit steep and
that<00:04:00.920> means<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.610> Citroen<00:04:02.030> ds3<00:04:02.330> offers

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
that means that the Citroen ds3 offers

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:11.320 
that means that the Citroen ds3 offers
better<00:04:03.530> value<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:09.760> despite<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.000> larger

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
better value and despite the larger

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.110 
better value and despite the larger
dimensions<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.319> more<00:04:12.590> room<00:04:12.800> for<00:04:12.980> passengers

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.940 

the<00:04:17.120> back<00:04:17.389> seats<00:04:17.720> are<00:04:17.900> still<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> bit<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.859> a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
the back seats are still a bit of a

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.400 
the back seats are still a bit of a
squish<00:04:19.400> there's<00:04:19.820> hardly<00:04:20.120> any<00:04:20.480> room<00:04:20.660> there<00:04:21.049> and

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
squish there's hardly any room there and

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.650 
squish there's hardly any room there and
it's<00:04:22.070> even<00:04:22.340> worse<00:04:22.550> if<00:04:22.820> somebody<00:04:23.090> like<00:04:23.270> matt<00:04:23.480> is

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
it's even worse if somebody like matt is

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.930 
it's even worse if somebody like matt is
driving<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:24.650> probably<00:04:24.919> best<00:04:25.220> if<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.669> Drive

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
driving so it's probably best if I Drive

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.570 
driving so it's probably best if I Drive
and<00:04:26.300> Matt<00:04:26.600> sits<00:04:26.840> in<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.050> back<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.580> know

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
and Matt sits in the back I know

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.970 
and Matt sits in the back I know
technically<00:04:29.540> that's<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.960> same<00:04:30.200> thing<00:04:30.530> but<00:04:30.740> it

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
technically that's the same thing but it

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.590 
technically that's the same thing but it
might<00:04:31.130> be<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.280> good<00:04:31.490> trick<00:04:31.790> into<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.180> driver's

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
might be a good trick into the driver's

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.909 
might be a good trick into the driver's
seat<00:04:32.710> anyway
