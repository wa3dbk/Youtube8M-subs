and point Veda is 12 seconds as you can

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.249 
and point Veda is 12 seconds as you can
see<00:02:03.829> both<00:02:04.159> closest<00:02:04.909> contact<00:02:05.420> points<00:02:05.840> are<00:02:05.960> very

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
see both closest contact points are very

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.259 
see both closest contact points are very

equally distributed between the teams

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.270 
equally distributed between the teams
and<00:02:08.509> why<00:02:08.690> exactly<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.709> choke<00:02:09.920> spots

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.369 
and why exactly in the choke spots
because<00:02:10.729> if<00:02:10.849> they<00:02:10.970> were<00:02:11.030> not<00:02:11.390> one<00:02:11.900> team<00:02:12.170> would

because if they were not one team would
