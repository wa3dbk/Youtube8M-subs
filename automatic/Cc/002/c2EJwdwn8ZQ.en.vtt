00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.410
 new era games games for playstation 3 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.450
 playstation 4 and xbox one on media 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 digital 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 prince of persia is one of the great 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.670
 classics that originated in the pc two 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.810
 that was born as 2d game and with the passing 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.070
 years it has evolved into a game 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.460
 three-dimensional or 3d 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.279
 the first of all was released in 89 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.619
 by jordan mecler who, besides creating the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.770
 game was a guy who introduced the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.500
 rotoscopy in games that is as if it were 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.000
 a forerunner of the modern 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 digital movement 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.399
 soon after creating the karateca game that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.280
 in fact it is a famous game he was 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.039
 head for another design project that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.039
 what would you call prince of persia 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.530
 first of all the game would not be called 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.770
 prince ps 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.680
 Initially the game would be called thee of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 bed name that was inspired by a movie 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.149
 with the same name 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.580
 only someone went there and suggested or places 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.820
 the name of thinking think a and b as 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.759
 can be seen in this diary of the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.939
 alas bad photograph the guy does not know 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.030
 write in your version say beta 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.909
 the game would not have any kind of combat 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.289
 would be basically an adventure game only 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.509
 more elaborate 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.659
 only they suggested to mac mini that he 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.179
 put these fights of the beginning game 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.700
 He kind of shit on this. 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.819
 only after analyzing the version almost 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990
 complete of the game he concluded that the game 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.909
 it was not good 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.310
 did not have that footprint and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.890
 adventure then as soon as he realized 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.500
 that the game underwent a drastic change 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 of 50 phases 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.000
 yes the game would have 50 phases fell to 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.560
 only 10 phases but say phases 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.229
 sensational we will not combine 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.120
 and look, you know that the game would have 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.970
 a phase editor 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.920
 basically it allows the player to create 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.079
 their own phases 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.799
 already thought how would it be you can 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:25.380
 create whatever crazy stage of time only 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.840
 which is editor has also been removed from the game 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.420
 after that change I said more 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.620
 connect in this video that shows as editor 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.620
 would work 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.989
 one of the main characteristics of 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.959
 game is no doubt the fight of the duel of 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.750
 and you can believe that it was only 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.590
 added at the end of production 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.959
 about the game 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.269
 already the mac nerci inspired in the film the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.880
 adventures of robin wood to create the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.980
 duels and this is evident when 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.110
 he uses a movie scene in that 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.130
 process defeated the copy I quoted 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.130
 it connects there 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.790
 and since I spoke of rotoscopy one of the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.190
 things they did during the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.070
 process of creating the game was the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.380
 capture character movements 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.320
 using frene by frame let's say who 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.680
 It was the guinea pig who was the actor was the 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.890
 brother of mac and david all filming was 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:58.230
 made in a vhs camera and everything went 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.230
 Shot in a parking lot 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.000
 this link in these images that are 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.790
 passing on the screen are the drafts 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.360
 originals that were used in the creation 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.840
 almost everything there is the example of the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.840
 autos the plates that fall on the floor 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.190
 Those doors that go down, you see there. 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.190
 it's too much time to see this 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 and these are the process images 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.979
 defeated if copied where you can see that 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.849
 everything was made a move with the 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.000
 movement 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.630
 they getting ready to skip the drink 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.800
 potton called the sword fighting and everything 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.800
 but it's amazing 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:25.330
 ah that's prince of persia it really is 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.520
 a classic of the classics 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.099
 It's a very mysterious game even if you 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.979
 stop to think and undoubtedly scored 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.680
 much the history of video games if so 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.470
 How do you like to know these things? 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.169
