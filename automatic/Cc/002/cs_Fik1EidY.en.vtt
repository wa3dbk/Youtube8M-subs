00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
how's it going you guys my name is

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.260 
how's it going you guys my name is
frisky<00:00:02.070> shotgun<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.639> today<00:00:02.850> I'm<00:00:03.090> doing

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
frisky shotgun and today I'm doing

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.599 
frisky shotgun and today I'm doing
something<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.870> little<00:00:03.929> bit<00:00:04.440> different<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:05.460> is

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
something a little bit different this is

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.610 
something a little bit different this is
a<00:00:05.730> tutorial<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.359> how<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.569> get<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.899> new<00:00:07.049> stone

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
a tutorial on how to get the new stone

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.400 
a tutorial on how to get the new stone
brick<00:00:07.859> texture<00:00:08.220> into<00:00:09.179> survival<00:00:09.809> mode<00:00:09.840> right

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
brick texture into survival mode right

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.350 
brick texture into survival mode right
now<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:10.740> only<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.010> creative<00:00:11.340> mode<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:12.120> in

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
now it's only in creative mode it's in

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.220 
now it's only in creative mode it's in
your<00:00:12.389> little<00:00:13.019> inventory<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:14.900> again<00:00:15.900> I'm<00:00:16.170> in

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
your little inventory and again I'm in

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.170 
your little inventory and again I'm in
creative<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:16.980> there<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.520> way<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:18.060> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
creative but there is a way to get it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.510 
creative but there is a way to get it
into<00:00:18.330> survival<00:00:19.020> mode<00:00:19.050> without<00:00:19.890> mods<00:00:20.310> or

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
into survival mode without mods or

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
into survival mode without mods or
hacking<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.840> right<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.500> this

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
hacking so right here we have this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.529 
hacking so right here we have this
little<00:00:23.100> contraption<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.060> no<00:00:24.269> idea

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
little contraption and I have no idea

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.359 
little contraption and I have no idea
how<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.779> works<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.080> don't<00:00:25.230> know<00:00:25.310> why<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
how it works I don't know why the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.000 
how it works I don't know why the
Redstone<00:00:27.060> causes<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.960> act<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> way<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
Redstone causes it to act this way and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.849 
Redstone causes it to act this way and
to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> did<00:00:30.990> watch<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> tutorial<00:00:31.410> on

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to do this but I did watch a tutorial on

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.459 
to do this but I did watch a tutorial on
it<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.250> uh<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:33.000> credits<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.899> video<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it so uh all credits of this video go to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
it so uh all credits of this video go to
auto<00:00:34.890> 42<00:00:35.520> 42<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.469> 24<00:00:37.469> 24<00:00:37.890> i'm<00:00:38.129> not<00:00:38.280> too<00:00:38.399> sure<00:00:38.430> i

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
auto 42 42 or 24 24 i'm not too sure i

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
auto 42 42 or 24 24 i'm not too sure i
watch<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.050> tutorial<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.649> i<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.920> have

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
watch this tutorial and i would have

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.490 
watch this tutorial and i would have
known<00:00:41.160> how<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.610> without<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.500> go

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
known how to do this without that so go

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.869 
known how to do this without that so go
watch<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.010> video<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> will<00:00:44.550> explain<00:00:44.610> how

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
watch this video that will explain how

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.380 
watch this video that will explain how
to<00:00:45.000> make<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.879> all<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.940> need<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.270> know

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
to make this so all you need to know

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380 
to make this so all you need to know
here<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> each<00:00:49.710> block<00:00:50.100> has<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.760> block<00:00:51.149> ID

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
here is that each block has a block ID

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.020 
here is that each block has a block ID
so<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.500> example<00:00:52.590> cobblestone<00:00:53.489> would<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.760> four

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so for example cobblestone would be four

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
so for example cobblestone would be four
that's<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.289> code<00:00:55.500> number<00:00:55.890> that's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that's just the code number that's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.209 
that's just the code number that's
correspondent<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.360> cobblestone<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.219> now

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
correspondent with cobblestone and now

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.810 
correspondent with cobblestone and now
some<00:00:59.670> blocks<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.719> data<00:01:01.079> values<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:02.399> example

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
some blocks have data values for example

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
some blocks have data values for example
wool<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.480> wolves<00:01:04.229> block<00:01:04.470> ID<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.949> 35<00:01:05.510> but<00:01:06.510> since

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
wool is wolves block ID is 35 but since

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
wool is wolves block ID is 35 but since
there's<00:01:07.439> orange<00:01:07.799> wool<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:09.150> whole<00:01:09.270> bunch

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
there's orange wool and a whole bunch

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
there's orange wool and a whole bunch
other<00:01:09.630> wolves<00:01:09.869> orange<00:01:10.770> will<00:01:10.920> would<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.189> 35

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
other wolves orange will would be 35

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.880 
other wolves orange will would be 35
with<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> value<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.409> Magenta's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
with the value of one and then Magenta's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.910 
with the value of one and then Magenta's
to<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.729> goes<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.170> every<00:01:16.680> block

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
to when it goes on and on so every block

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.170 
to when it goes on and on so every block
that<00:01:17.159> has<00:01:17.340> data<00:01:17.700> values<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.390> blocks<00:01:18.720> that

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
that has data values are blocks that

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.450 
that has data values are blocks that
it's<00:01:21.180> hard<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> explain<00:01:22.159> blocks<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.310> data

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's hard to explain blocks with data

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
it's hard to explain blocks with data
values<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:23.970> blocks<00:01:24.210> such<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.570> wood<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:25.130> say

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
values are blocks such as wood where say

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.649 
values are blocks such as wood where say
for<00:01:26.549> example<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.030> birch<00:01:27.180> wood<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
for example we have birch wood and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
for example we have birch wood and
normal<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.460> they<00:01:29.460> both<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> exact

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
normal would they both have the exact

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
normal would they both have the exact
same<00:01:30.270> properties<00:01:31.020> except<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> only

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
same properties except the only

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.800 
same properties except the only
difference<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.509> they<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> different

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
difference is that they have a different

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.010 
difference is that they have a different
texture<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.250> act<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> exact<00:01:35.820> same<00:01:36.000> way<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
texture so the act the exact same way so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.499 
texture so the act the exact same way so
notch<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.590> Jeb<00:01:38.040> instead<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.460> actually<00:01:39.240> adding

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
notch and Jeb instead of actually adding

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.640 
notch and Jeb instead of actually adding
a<00:01:39.570> whole<00:01:39.689> bunch<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> new<00:01:40.020> blocks<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.500> just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a whole bunch of new blocks they just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.149 
a whole bunch of new blocks they just
added<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.979> beta<00:01:41.189> values<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.979> we're<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
added in beta values so we're going to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
added in beta values so we're going to
show<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> how<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> change<00:01:44.640> those<00:01:45.180> data<00:01:45.479> values

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
show you how to change those data values

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.649 
show you how to change those data values
and<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.280> got<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.820> say<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.479> want

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and all you got to do is say if we want

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929

got white wool and we don't were too

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.920 
got white wool and we don't were too
lazy<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.399> die<00:01:53.610> oh<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.810> do

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
lazy to go and get die oh we all you do

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.310 
lazy to go and get die oh we all you do
is<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> wool<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.299> put<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.450> redstone<00:01:57.869> over

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
is put the wool here put a redstone over

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.679 
is put the wool here put a redstone over
there<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.850> I'm<00:01:59.850> led<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> believe<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.659> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
there and I'm led to believe this is a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.350 
there and I'm led to believe this is a
glitch<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> bug<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.969> don't

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
glitch or a bug just because I don't

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
glitch or a bug just because I don't
think<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.340> meant<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> do

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
think you can it's really meant to do

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.029 
think you can it's really meant to do
this<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.479> anyways<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:07.740> we're<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this but anyways so now we're going to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.380 
this but anyways so now we're going to
place<00:02:08.190> water<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.729> where<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> place<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
place water and where you place the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
place water and where you place the
water<00:02:09.569> depends<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.349> data<00:02:10.830> value<00:02:11.190> you're

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
water depends on what data value you're

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.949 
water depends on what data value you're
changing<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.209> example<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.870> right

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
changing for example if you do it right

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.370 
changing for example if you do it right
up

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
up

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
up
one<00:02:13.650> block<00:02:13.830> away<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.670> I'll<00:02:14.790> give<00:02:14.940> this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
one block away then I'll give this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.320 
one block away then I'll give this
orange<00:02:15.420> will<00:02:15.980> because<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> value<00:02:18.240> of

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
orange will because it's the value of

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.190 
orange will because it's the value of
one<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.120> kind<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.390> kind<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
one so with that we can kind of kind of

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400 
one so with that we can kind of kind of
predict<00:02:22.970> which<00:02:23.970> ones<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.300> want<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.780> we'll<00:02:25.290> do

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
predict which ones we want so we'll do

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.910 
predict which ones we want so we'll do
that<00:02:25.530> again<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.120> say<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.240> want<00:02:27.650> say<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.740> want

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that again and say we want say we want

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.490 
that again and say we want say we want
yellow<00:02:29.130> wool<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.660> would<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.840> zero<00:02:31.170> white

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
yellow wool so this would be zero white

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.970 
yellow wool so this would be zero white
one<00:02:32.010> two<00:02:32.430> three<00:02:33.300> four<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.380> if<00:02:34.440> we<00:02:34.590> go<00:02:34.620> four

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
one two three four so now if we go four

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.810 
one two three four so now if we go four
blocks<00:02:35.010> away<00:02:35.460> one<00:02:36.210> two<00:02:36.660> three<00:02:37.260> four<00:02:37.820> right

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
blocks away one two three four right

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.470 
blocks away one two three four right
here<00:02:39.710> there's<00:02:40.710> f5<00:02:42.470> let's<00:02:43.470> try<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:44.210> okay<00:02:45.210> so

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
I didn't mention this um it's in the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.190 
I didn't mention this um it's in the
order<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.940> data<00:03:00.120> values<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.960> zero

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
order of the data values so this is zero

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.300 
order of the data values so this is zero
mossies<00:03:02.010> one<00:03:02.220> cracked<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.090> two<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:05.250> one

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
mossies one cracked is two and this one

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.680 
mossies one cracked is two and this one
would<00:03:05.580> be<00:03:05.610> three<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.150> we'll<00:03:06.300> go<00:03:06.450> three<00:03:06.660> blocks

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
would be three so we'll go three blocks

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.800 
would be three so we'll go three blocks
away<00:03:07.020> one<00:03:07.590> two<00:03:08.310> three<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:10.820> there<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.940> go<00:03:12.060> we

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
away one two three and there you go we

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.950 
away one two three and there you go we
got<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.050> new<00:03:13.140> texture<00:03:13.530> which<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:13.980> awesome<00:03:14.960> you

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
got the new texture which is awesome you

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.600 
got the new texture which is awesome you
know<00:03:16.050> we<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.380> do<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.470> again<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:16.920> want<00:03:17.190> mossy

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
know we can do it again if we want mossy

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.510 
know we can do it again if we want mossy
instead<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.770> trying<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.860> go<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.280> find<00:03:20.430> a

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
instead of trying to go and find a

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.080 
instead of trying to go and find a
stronghold<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:21.630> would<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.870> much<00:03:21.960> easier<00:03:23.090> so

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
stronghold this would be much easier so

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.500 
stronghold this would be much easier so
yeah<00:03:24.240> that's<00:03:25.050> pretty<00:03:25.230> much<00:03:25.620> how<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.830> works<00:03:26.510> I

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
yeah that's pretty much how it works I

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.670 
yeah that's pretty much how it works I
don't<00:03:27.870> know<00:03:27.930> if<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.110> consider<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.620> cheating

don't know if you consider this cheating

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.430

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
minecraft I don't think it's really

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.970 
minecraft I don't think it's really
cheating<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.500> know<00:03:40.590> you're<00:03:40.800> using

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
cheating you know you're using

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.980 
cheating you know you're using
everything<00:03:41.460> in<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.820> game<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.240> if<00:03:42.420> notch<00:03:42.840> and

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
everything in the game and if notch and

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.900 
everything in the game and if notch and
Jeb<00:03:43.200> don't<00:03:43.410> like<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.770> then<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.520> can<00:03:44.550> change

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
Jeb don't like that then they can change

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.370 
Jeb don't like that then they can change

all right now over here what we have
with<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.560> cobblestone<00:03:53.400> mess<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.870> actually

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
with this cobblestone mess is actually

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.810 
with this cobblestone mess is actually
made<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.430> sort<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.520> machine<00:03:56.820> that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
made a sort of machine that

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
made a sort of machine that
automatically<00:03:59.820> changed<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.690> know

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
automatically changed is it and you know

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.480 
automatically changed is it and you know
which<00:04:00.990> one<00:04:01.170> you're<00:04:01.260> going<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.440> change<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
which one you're going to change so I

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.580 
which one you're going to change so I
made<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.209> chart<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.690> here<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.440> has<00:04:04.560> a

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
made this little chart on here it has a

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.480 
made this little chart on here it has a
whole<00:04:04.800> bunch<00:04:05.270> so<00:04:06.270> all<00:04:06.570> you<00:04:06.600> gotta<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:06.959> is

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
whole bunch so all you gotta do is

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.140 
whole bunch so all you gotta do is
actually<00:04:08.490> i'll<00:04:08.700> tell<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.910> how<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.000> works

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
actually i'll tell you how it works

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.310 
actually i'll tell you how it works
first<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.410> each<00:04:10.740> button<00:04:11.070> here<00:04:12.080> corresponds<00:04:13.080> to

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
first so each button here corresponds to

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.190 
first so each button here corresponds to
a<00:04:13.670> floodgate<00:04:14.670> up<00:04:14.970> here<00:04:15.209> there<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.750> whole

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
a floodgate up here there is a whole

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.490 
a floodgate up here there is a whole
bunch<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:17.190> say<00:04:17.340> if<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.549> pressed<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.299> first<00:04:19.290> one

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
bunch so say if I pressed the first one

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.580 
bunch so say if I pressed the first one
being<00:04:19.859> orange<00:04:20.430> wool<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.180> mossy<00:04:21.930> stone<00:04:22.169> and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
being orange wool and mossy stone and

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.360 
being orange wool and mossy stone and
Sam<00:04:22.919> stone

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
Sam stone

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.969 
Sam stone
dark<00:04:25.060> wood<00:04:25.240> what<00:04:26.139> do<00:04:26.199> we<00:04:26.229> do<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.770> raised

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
dark wood what do we do is it raised

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.860 
dark wood what do we do is it raised
this<00:04:27.160> lever<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.699> then<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.270> water<00:04:28.449> would<00:04:28.630> fall

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
this lever and then the water would fall

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.980 
this lever and then the water would fall
on<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.560> data<00:04:29.740> value<00:04:30.130> one<00:04:30.820> spot<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.690> then<00:04:31.840> that

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
on the data value one spot so then that

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.950 
on the data value one spot so then that
give<00:04:32.169> me<00:04:32.229> that<00:04:32.260> wolf<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:34.500> for<00:04:35.500> example<00:04:36.750> say<00:04:37.750> if

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
give me that wolf so for example say if

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.480 
give me that wolf so for example say if

cobblestone<00:05:08.520> into<00:05:09.520> let's<00:05:10.150> say<00:05:10.270> brick<00:05:11.430> all

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
cobblestone into let's say brick all

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.529 
cobblestone into let's say brick all
have<00:05:12.610> to<00:05:12.699> do<00:05:12.789> is<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:13.000> place<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.419> there<00:05:14.460> and

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
have to do is I place that there and

have to do is I place that there and
there<00:05:16.539> you<00:05:16.630> go<00:05:16.720> brick<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.320> so<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.280> could

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
there you go brick and so you could

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.430 
there you go brick and so you could
actually<00:05:19.270> kind<00:05:19.690> of<00:05:19.750> cheat<00:05:19.960> your<00:05:20.110> way<00:05:20.139> into

changing<00:05:21.070> cobblestone<00:05:21.669> into<00:05:21.970> brick<00:05:22.180> just<00:05:23.139> by

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
changing cobblestone into brick just by

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.980 
changing cobblestone into brick just by
you<00:05:23.350> know<00:05:23.710> using<00:05:23.919> double<00:05:24.400> slabs<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:24.990> another

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
you know using double slabs and another

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.310 
you know using double slabs and another
cool<00:05:26.470> thing<00:05:26.500> that<00:05:27.100> I<00:05:27.130> find<00:05:27.430> which<00:05:27.729> is<00:05:28.260> kind<00:05:29.260> of

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
cool thing that I find which is kind of

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.740 
cool thing that I find which is kind of
funny<00:05:29.849> let's<00:05:30.849> just<00:05:30.880> say<00:05:31.060> we<00:05:31.240> don't<00:05:31.330> like<00:05:31.510> wood

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
and we want double slab so it'll

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.140 
and we want double slab so it'll
actually<00:05:33.700> happen<00:05:34.020> stone<00:05:35.020> slabs<00:05:35.880> if<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.000> press

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
actually happen stone slabs if the press

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.460 
actually happen stone slabs if the press
this<00:05:37.270> button<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:37.720> I<00:05:37.780> want<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.020> change<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.349> to

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
this button and I want to change it to

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.339 
this button and I want to change it to
stone<00:05:39.160> slabs<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:40.419> will<00:05:40.570> actually<00:05:40.750> like<00:05:41.200> a

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
stone slabs it will actually like a

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.990 
stone slabs it will actually like a
merge<00:05:41.680> into<00:05:41.950> one<00:05:42.070> block<00:05:42.430> which<00:05:42.700> is<00:05:42.820> actually

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
merge into one block which is actually

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.779 
merge into one block which is actually
kind<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.389> neat<00:05:43.570> there's<00:05:44.050> no<00:05:44.229> line<00:05:44.500> in<00:05:44.680> between

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
kind of neat there's no line in between

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.450 
kind of neat there's no line in between
that's<00:05:45.789> just<00:05:45.970> one<00:05:46.270> sounds<00:05:46.870> kind<00:05:47.050> of<00:05:47.080> cool<00:05:47.460> i'll

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
that's just one sounds kind of cool i'll

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.010 
that's just one sounds kind of cool i'll
do<00:05:48.639> another<00:05:48.669> example<00:05:49.000> here<00:05:49.330> with<00:05:49.599> wood<00:05:49.810> I

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020
