00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello I am the life of tinkers dad 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.519
 and today I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.110
 how vitrified a work plan 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 first one always have surfaces 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.730
 clean and smooth so thoroughly clean with 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.730
 a cloth a slightly damp sponge 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.579
 whatever we do the preparation is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.989
 still very important is the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.250
 preparation that will determine the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.460
 final result all the DIY one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.550
 well prepared surface it allows to have 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 a well finished surface on arrival so 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.520
 there we face a work plan that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.989
 has already been used before or 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 vitrification of the blow we have some 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.550
 small breeds of which are encrusted to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.309
 the interior has in this case I 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.280
 advise of two bridges this is slightly 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.309
 we use a fine sandpaper that goes 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.309
 allow us to withdraw 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.409
 always in the direction of the wood grain 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.970
 see the wood a certain film this 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 what is called yarn is the meaning of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.290
 wood features that ensure the wood 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.460
 always thought in this sense there never 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.460
 go against the wood 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 stir every time the in2 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 justifying 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 to vitrify a work plan he 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.270
 must use a brush a brush to 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.670
 to vitrify is always the weight the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.190
 lily it is soft and it allows precisely 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.380
 to get into the woods and 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:05.900
 well the one bib and the wood of 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:10.760
 vitrifying it happens in two layers 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:15.100
 even three is always applied in the 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.100
 sense of the wood grain 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.830
 not hesitant but a good dose 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.660
 and here is the vitrification the 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.280
 first layer of vitrification is 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.490
 made 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.930
 there is one or two left to go from 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.640
 way to have something of 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.220
 to quench well protect 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.560
 so the idea is to create a small 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.530
 vitrification layer so that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.600
 that if we run water that does not happen 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.430
 not end of the wood if we 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.200
 sink some products whatever it is 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.950
 will not come that will not come the wood 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.950
 have that two layers 3 would be the ideal
