hello<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.360> welcome<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.990> another<00:00:04.140> one<00:00:04.290> where

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hello and welcome to another one where

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.990 
hello and welcome to another one where
video<00:00:04.650> was<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.190> one<00:00:05.430> as<00:00:05.640> you<00:00:05.700> can<00:00:05.910> see

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
video was in this one as you can see

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.660 
video was in this one as you can see
I've<00:00:06.359> got<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.629> GSXR<00:00:07.379> front<00:00:07.710> end<00:00:07.919> mounted<00:00:08.429> onto

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
I've got the GSXR front end mounted onto

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.110 
I've got the GSXR front end mounted onto
the<00:00:09.120> CX<00:00:09.450> rim<00:00:09.860> that's<00:00:10.860> your<00:00:11.190> Forks<00:00:11.639> perfectly

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
the CX rim that's your Forks perfectly

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.180 
the CX rim that's your Forks perfectly
usable<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.809> when<00:00:13.710> you're<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
usable but when you're going to do a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.470 
usable but when you're going to do a
project<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.730> might<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.000> well<00:00:15.120> go<00:00:15.299> all<00:00:15.360> out

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
project you might as well go all out

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
project you might as well go all out
with<00:00:15.630> it

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
with it

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040 
with it
so<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.220> main<00:00:17.400> actual<00:00:18.029> thing<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.570> putting

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
so the main actual thing of putting

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
so the main actual thing of putting
these<00:00:19.170> Forks<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.430> test<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.789> this

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
these Forks on was just a test that this

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670 
these Forks on was just a test that this
Steven<00:00:21.420> stem<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> right<00:00:22.140> length<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
Steven stem was the right length and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.970 
Steven stem was the right length and
after<00:00:23.010> minting<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.210> actual<00:00:24.650> CX<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
after minting it up to the actual CX to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.060 
after minting it up to the actual CX to
human<00:00:26.250> stem<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.630> basically<00:00:28.109> identical<00:00:28.590> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
human stem it was basically identical so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.859 
human stem it was basically identical so
instead<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> route<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
instead of going down the route of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
instead of going down the route of
pressing<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.470> stem<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.279> putting<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> CX

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
pressing one stem out and putting the CX

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.319 
pressing one stem out and putting the CX
one<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> actual<00:00:34.290> GSXR<00:00:35.010> York<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.760> just

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
one into the actual GSXR York I'm just

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.959 
one into the actual GSXR York I'm just
going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.350> ball<00:00:37.790> tapered<00:00:38.790> ball

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
going to go for a all ball tapered ball

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.880 
going to go for a all ball tapered ball
band<00:00:39.360> conversion<00:00:39.899> kit<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.590> basically

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
band conversion kit which basically

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
band conversion kit which basically
gives<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:42.090> sized<00:00:42.690> ball<00:00:43.140> bearings

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
gives you the right sized ball bearings

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
gives you the right sized ball bearings
bottom<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.010> top<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.550> fit<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> stem<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.210> want

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
bottom and top to fit the stem you want

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.229 
bottom and top to fit the stem you want
to<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.800> I've<00:00:47.070> ordered<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.640> hopefully

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
to put in so I've ordered them hopefully

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.760 
to put in so I've ordered them hopefully
they'll<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.510> coming<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.960> next<00:00:49.079> week<00:00:49.260> obviously

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
they'll be coming in next week obviously

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.229 
they'll be coming in next week obviously
they<00:00:49.920> won't<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.219> fitted<00:00:50.520> until<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> frame<00:00:51.090> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
they won't be fitted until the frame is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.639 
they won't be fitted until the frame is
powder-coated<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.020> ready<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.410> put<00:00:52.620> back

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
powder-coated and ready to get put back

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
powder-coated and ready to get put back
together<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:54.030> best<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
together but it's best to have all the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
together but it's best to have all the
parts<00:00:54.870> ready<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.739> other<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:56.100> when

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
parts ready so you know other there when

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.250 
parts ready so you know other there when
you<00:00:56.399> need<00:00:56.579> them

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
you need them

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
you need them
so<00:00:58.260> another<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.430> putting<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> actual

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so another thing of putting the actual

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
so another thing of putting the actual
forks<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.680> seeing<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:02.609> steel<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
forks on is seeing how much steel and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.649 
forks on is seeing how much steel and
angle<00:01:03.359> I've<00:01:03.449> got<00:01:03.660> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> much<00:01:05.659> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
angle I've got which is not that much so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.820 
angle I've got which is not that much so
basically<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.710> I'm

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
basically what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> take<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> angle<00:01:08.549> grinder<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> these

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
going to take the angle grinder to these

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.660 
going to take the angle grinder to these
stops<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.890> cut<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.460> line

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
stops here and just cut down that line

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
stops here and just cut down that line
on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> CX<00:01:12.360> frame<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.840> hopefully<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.200> just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
on the CX frame and hopefully that just

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.190 
on the CX frame and hopefully that just
give<00:01:13.530> us<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.680> tad<00:01:13.979> bit<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.720> steering<00:01:15.720> angle

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
give us a tad bit more steering angle

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
give us a tad bit more steering angle
for<00:01:16.409> when<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.830> slow<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.490> obviously

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
for when I'm going slow so obviously

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.950 
for when I'm going slow so obviously
slow<00:01:18.900> move<00:01:20.119> maneuverability<00:01:21.119> I'll<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.840> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
slow move maneuverability I'll get that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
slow move maneuverability I'll get that
out<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.060> another<00:01:24.060> problem<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
out when I can and another problem that

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
out when I can and another problem that
and<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:25.140> people<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> change

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and all some people have when the change

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.780 
and all some people have when the change
the<00:01:26.460> front<00:01:26.670> end<00:01:26.880> on/off<00:01:27.750> G&amp;J<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.189> CX<00:01:29.549> front

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the front end on/off G&amp;J the CX front

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.380 
the front end on/off G&amp;J the CX front
end<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> u.s.<00:01:30.420> d1<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.470> hit<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> tank

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
end with the u.s. d1 is the hit the tank

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.940 
end with the u.s. d1 is the hit the tank
now<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> full<00:01:34.710> lock

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
now as we can see this is a full lock

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.149 
now as we can see this is a full lock
now<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.579> doesn't<00:01:36.240> hit<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> tank<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.560> even<00:01:38.070> if

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
now and doesn't hit the tank so even if

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
now and doesn't hit the tank so even if
I<00:01:38.250> tear<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> material<00:01:39.900> off

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I tear that a little bit of material off

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.899 
I tear that a little bit of material off
there<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> help<00:01:41.040> me<00:01:41.220> stay<00:01:41.430> an<00:01:41.610> angle<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
there just to help me stay an angle a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.249 
there just to help me stay an angle a
bit<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.240> still<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> touch<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
bit I'm still not going to touch the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.649 
bit I'm still not going to touch the
tank<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.700> people<00:01:44.729> came<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
tank and all some people came to put a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.600 
tank and all some people came to put a
little<00:01:45.869> recess<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> tank<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> forks

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
little recess in the tank so the forks

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.160 
little recess in the tank so the forks
actually<00:01:47.880> sit<00:01:48.060> into<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.750> doesn't<00:01:48.899> hit

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
actually sit into it so it doesn't hit

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
actually sit into it so it doesn't hit
but<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> try<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> keep<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
but I want to try to keep this the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.960 
but I want to try to keep this the
actual<00:01:51.540> CX<00:01:51.869> 500<00:01:52.439> tank<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.100> same<00:01:53.340> shape<00:01:53.640> as

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
actual CX 500 tank the same shape as

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.139 
actual CX 500 tank the same shape as
stock<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.020> basically<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.619> pin<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:57.060> so

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
stock and basically just pin it just so

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
stock and basically just pin it just so
it<00:01:57.270> still<00:01:57.570> looks<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.930> CX<00:01:58.350> you're<00:01:58.770> still

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it still looks like a CX you're still

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.490 
it still looks like a CX you're still
naught<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> CX<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> yeah<00:02:00.899> that's<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> front

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
naught to CX so yeah that's the front

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.580 
naught to CX so yeah that's the front
end<00:02:01.680> over<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> moon<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:04.020> moving<00:02:04.320> on

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
end over the moon with it now moving on

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.980 
end over the moon with it now moving on
as<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> mast<00:02:06.240> video<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> cut

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
as you can see from the mast video I cut

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
as you can see from the mast video I cut
the<00:02:07.079> back<00:02:07.229> end<00:02:07.259> off<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> actual

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the back end off and this is the actual

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.969 
the back end off and this is the actual
in<00:02:09.720> fabrication<00:02:10.349> which<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.709> forgot<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
in fabrication which I forgot to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.770 
in fabrication which I forgot to
actually<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> bring<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:12.060> me<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.720> can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
actually to bring with me and as you can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.760 
actually to bring with me and as you can
see<00:02:12.870> if

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
see if

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
see if
without<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.160> fabrication<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.850> was<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> bloody

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
without the fabrication it was a bloody

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.960 
without the fabrication it was a bloody
good<00:02:15.660> cutting<00:02:15.960> job<00:02:16.230> because<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.860> fits<00:02:17.460> pretty

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
good cutting job because it fits pretty

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.480 
good cutting job because it fits pretty
much<00:02:18.180> perfectly<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.860> mounts<00:02:20.010> onto<00:02:20.310> these

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
much perfectly and it mounts onto these

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.580 
much perfectly and it mounts onto these
two<00:02:20.760> bolts<00:02:21.270> here<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.230> basically<00:02:22.500> just

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
two bolts here so this is basically just

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.410 
two bolts here so this is basically just
keeping<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.190> place<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.850> once<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.270> all

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
keeping it in place but once it's all

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.390 
keeping it in place but once it's all
welded<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.290> won't<00:02:25.440> need<00:02:25.590> those<00:02:25.800> bolts<00:02:26.130> but

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
welded in you won't need those bolts but

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
welded in you won't need those bolts but
I<00:02:26.460> want<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> keep<00:02:26.820> them<00:02:27.030> there<00:02:27.270> anyway<00:02:27.300> I'll

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
I want to keep them there anyway I'll

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.210 
I want to keep them there anyway I'll
just<00:02:28.050> get<00:02:28.200> them<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.410> powder-coated<00:02:28.800> with<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
just get them all powder-coated with the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.020 
just get them all powder-coated with the
firm<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> next<00:02:31.500> stage<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.580> welder

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
firm so next stage is to get a welder

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.360 
firm so next stage is to get a welder
just<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.360> put<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> nice<00:02:33.780> seam<00:02:34.140> weld<00:02:34.410> down<00:02:35.100> here

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just to put a nice seam weld down here

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.760 
just to put a nice seam weld down here
and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:36.450> around<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.900> wing<00:02:37.170> here<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
and then around this wing here and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.410 
and then around this wing here and
around<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.490> then<00:02:38.700> once<00:02:38.880> he's<00:02:39.030> done<00:02:39.240> that

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
around here and then once he's done that

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.020 
around here and then once he's done that
basically<00:02:40.080> flatten<00:02:41.070> these<00:02:41.130> wings<00:02:41.460> off<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
basically flatten these wings off so the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.160 
basically flatten these wings off so the
match<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.420> frame<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.400> yeah<00:02:44.400> then<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.840> part

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
match the frame and yeah then this part

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.390 
match the frame and yeah then this part
the<00:02:46.320> bikes<00:02:46.530> ready<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.920> go<00:02:47.070> off<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> powder

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the bikes ready to go off the powder

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.760 
the bikes ready to go off the powder

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
court and the only other bit which needs

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.410 
court and the only other bit which needs
some<00:02:49.950> modification<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> need<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> put<00:02:51.240> the

as this one once that's done and this is
done<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.070> frame<00:03:05.310> will<00:03:05.460> be<00:03:05.490> going<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.790> powder

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
done this frame will be going to powder

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.350 
done this frame will be going to powder
corn<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:07.140> next<00:03:07.560> week<00:03:07.740> I'm<00:03:08.040> going<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.340> try<00:03:08.940> and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
corn so next week I'm going to try and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.780 
corn so next week I'm going to try and
basically<00:03:09.810> strip<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.590> whole<00:03:10.800> thing<00:03:11.100> back<00:03:11.430> I

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
basically strip this whole thing back I

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.910 
basically strip this whole thing back I
just<00:03:12.750> wanted<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.140> fit<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> front<00:03:13.530> forks

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
just wanted to fit the front forks

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.460 
just wanted to fit the front forks
before<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> did<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.910> knew<00:03:15.230> when<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.320> came

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
before I did that so I knew when it came

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.020 
before I did that so I knew when it came
back<00:03:16.530> from<00:03:16.770> powder<00:03:17.040> corn<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.490> just<00:03:17.700> had<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.880> put

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
back from powder corn I just had to put

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.430 
back from powder corn I just had to put
the<00:03:18.120> bearings<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.780> don't<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.290> worry

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
the bearings in and don't have to worry

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.280 
the bearings in and don't have to worry
about<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.860> too<00:03:20.100> much

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
about that too much

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.930 
about that too much
another<00:03:22.290> thing<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.709> I've<00:03:22.980> got<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.340> York<00:03:23.610> here

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
another thing is I've got this York here

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.900 
another thing is I've got this York here
now<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:25.709> front<00:03:25.920> end<00:03:26.100> didn't<00:03:26.340> come<00:03:26.490> with<00:03:26.640> York

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
now the front end didn't come with York

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.270 
now the front end didn't come with York
when<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.120> got<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.690> thought<00:03:27.930> okay<00:03:28.440> I'll<00:03:29.010> get

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
when I got it so I thought okay I'll get

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.449 
when I got it so I thought okay I'll get
one<00:03:29.459> or<00:03:29.550> Phoebe<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.000> now<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.240> is<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> s<00:03:31.020> rad

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
one or Phoebe and now this is a s rad

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.990 
one or Phoebe and now this is a s rad
600<00:03:32.480> GSXR<00:03:33.480> top<00:03:34.080> York<00:03:34.380> me<00:03:35.160> being<00:03:35.430> me<00:03:35.610> thought

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
600 GSXR top York me being me thought

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.960 
600 GSXR top York me being me thought
the<00:03:36.480> basically<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.470> 750<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.250> 600<00:03:38.550> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the basically the 750 and the 600 the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.690 
the basically the 750 and the 600 the
same<00:03:39.180> bike<00:03:39.390> just<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.720> bigger<00:03:39.959> engine<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.700> was

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
same bike just a bigger engine I was

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.140 
same bike just a bigger engine I was
wrong

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
wrong

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.250 
wrong
as<00:03:42.840> normal<00:03:43.470> basically<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.640> s<00:03:44.790> rad<00:03:45.120> 750<00:03:46.020> has

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
as normal basically the s rad 750 has

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.610 
as normal basically the s rad 750 has
slightly<00:03:46.770> bigger<00:03:47.010> forks<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:48.230> know<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> seals

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
slightly bigger forks I know the seals

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.880 
slightly bigger forks I know the seals
are<00:03:49.860> two<00:03:50.010> Mille<00:03:50.250> bigger<00:03:50.520> so<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:52.380> top<00:03:52.590> York

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
are two Mille bigger so the top York

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.980 
are two Mille bigger so the top York
doesn't<00:03:53.160> fit<00:03:53.520> but<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.150> was<00:03:54.330> only<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.540> tennis

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
doesn't fit but this was only a tennis

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.740 
doesn't fit but this was only a tennis
or<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> don't<00:03:55.530> mind<00:03:55.800> trying<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.400> actually

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
or I don't mind trying to actually

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.080 
or I don't mind trying to actually
expand<00:03:57.750> these<00:03:58.459> openings<00:03:59.459> up<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.700> bit<00:03:59.820> now<00:03:59.970> as

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
expand these openings up a bit now as

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.580 
expand these openings up a bit now as
you<00:04:00.240> can<00:04:00.300> see<00:04:00.510> I've<00:04:00.810> actually<00:04:01.050> tried<00:04:01.470> to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
you can see I've actually tried to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.890 
you can see I've actually tried to
expand<00:04:02.490> this<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.760> bit<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.240> still<00:04:03.630> doesn't

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
expand this a bit and it still doesn't

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900 
expand this a bit and it still doesn't
fit<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.890> getting<00:04:05.220> there<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:05.490> still<00:04:05.760> not

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
fit it's getting there but still not

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.460 
fit it's getting there but still not
fitting<00:04:06.270> so<00:04:06.360> I'm<00:04:06.420> going<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.690> keep<00:04:06.990> working<00:04:07.380> at

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
fitting so I'm going to keep working at

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.260 
fitting so I'm going to keep working at
that<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.370> can<00:04:08.610> see<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.940> see<00:04:09.060> how<00:04:09.150> much

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
that as you can see and see how much

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.560 
that as you can see and see how much
I've<00:04:09.480> came<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.780> open<00:04:10.050> them<00:04:10.170> up<00:04:10.230> by<00:04:11.570> worst-case

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
I've came to open them up by worst-case

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.530 
I've came to open them up by worst-case
scenario<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.230> I'm<00:04:13.350> going<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.650> have<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.920> get<00:04:14.070> a

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
scenario is I'm going to have to get a

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.199 
scenario is I'm going to have to get a
GSXR<00:04:15.540> 750<00:04:16.200> top<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.770> walk<00:04:16.950> but<00:04:17.250> for<00:04:17.700> a<00:04:17.730> tenant<00:04:18.120> I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
GSXR 750 top you walk but for a tenant I

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.349 
GSXR 750 top you walk but for a tenant I
might<00:04:18.450> as<00:04:18.570> well<00:04:18.720> try<00:04:19.220> because<00:04:20.220> once<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.180> has

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
might as well try because once this has

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.640 
might as well try because once this has
opened<00:04:21.480> up<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.870> clamped<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.290> you've<00:04:22.410> got<00:04:22.560> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
opened up and clamped and you've got the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.810 
opened up and clamped and you've got the
bolts<00:04:22.890> right<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:23.190> there<00:04:23.400> as<00:04:23.460> long<00:04:23.550> as<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
bolts right in there as long as the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.400 
bolts right in there as long as the
bolts<00:04:24.090> got<00:04:24.270> enough<00:04:24.450> threads<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:25.110> doesn't

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
bolts got enough threads it doesn't

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.260 
bolts got enough threads it doesn't
matter<00:04:25.560> how<00:04:25.770> much<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.250> kinda<00:04:26.669> goes<00:04:26.880> right

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
matter how much this kinda goes right

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.610 
matter how much this kinda goes right
we<00:04:27.330> around<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.599> fork<00:04:27.870> as<00:04:28.020> long<00:04:28.199> as<00:04:28.319> it<00:04:28.410> grips

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
we around the fork as long as it grips

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.040 
we around the fork as long as it grips
it<00:04:28.800> most<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.669> actual<00:04:30.180> force<00:04:30.629> is<00:04:30.840> going

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
it most the actual force is going

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.839 
it most the actual force is going
through<00:04:31.259> this<00:04:31.410> triple<00:04:32.099> tree<00:04:32.310> here<00:04:32.550> where<00:04:32.729> the

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
through this triple tree here where the

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.830 
through this triple tree here where the
stem<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.120> saw<00:04:33.949> yeah<00:04:35.270> try<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.360> work<00:04:36.479> with<00:04:36.509> this

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
stem is saw yeah try and work with this

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.480 
stem is saw yeah try and work with this
and<00:04:37.080> I'm<00:04:37.169> going<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.500> polish<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.919> all<00:04:38.099> look<00:04:38.310> I

this<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.860> ignition<00:04:44.389> mount<00:04:45.389> on<00:04:45.659> the<00:04:45.780> old

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
this is the ignition mount on the old

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.950 
this is the ignition mount on the old
GSXR<00:04:46.979> york<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.879> if<00:04:48.479> i<00:04:48.599> just<00:04:48.750> move<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.409> actual

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
GSXR york and if i just move the actual

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.219 
GSXR york and if i just move the actual
mounting<00:04:51.960> points<00:04:52.379> on<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.620> CX<00:04:53.360> bowel<00:04:54.360> will

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
mounting points on the CX bowel will

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.659 
mounting points on the CX bowel will
actually<00:04:55.530> fit<00:04:55.710> straight<00:04:55.979> on<00:04:56.159> here<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.550> what

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
to break the ridge here now you can see

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.529 
to break the ridge here now you can see
if<00:05:07.530> I<00:05:07.680> hit<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.400> keys<00:05:08.610> out<00:05:08.819> first<00:05:09.150> it's<00:05:09.419> not

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
if I hit the keys out first it's not

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:10.809 
if I hit the keys out first it's not
going<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.780> fit

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
going to fit

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.320 
going to fit
if<00:05:11.819> I<00:05:11.940> stick<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:12.330> on<00:05:12.509> here<00:05:13.849> then<00:05:14.849> actually

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
if I stick this on here then actually

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.870 
if I stick this on here then actually
though<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.960> holes<00:05:16.169> for<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.009> comfort<00:05:17.460> the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
though the holes for the comfort the

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.600 
though the holes for the comfort the
holes<00:05:18.150> actually<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.780> line<00:05:19.259> up<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.490> bit

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
holes actually do line up the just a bit

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.779 
holes actually do line up the just a bit
further<00:05:20.819> out<00:05:21.090> so<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.919> basically<00:05:22.919> tip<00:05:23.639> this

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
further out so for basically tip this

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.520 
further out so for basically tip this
Hall<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.800> elongated<00:05:25.800> out<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.490> back<00:05:27.419> here<00:05:27.659> we

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
Hall and elongated out to back here we

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.589 
Hall and elongated out to back here we
can<00:05:28.710> then<00:05:28.830> Center<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.430> in<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.789> Hall<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.389> we

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
can then Center that in that Hall and we

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.749 
can then Center that in that Hall and we
can<00:05:30.719> use<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:31.020> original<00:05:31.229> CX<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.849> Honda<00:05:33.150> CX<00:05:33.509> in

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
can use the original CX the Honda CX in

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.279 
can use the original CX the Honda CX in
ignition<00:05:35.759> bubble<00:05:36.030> which<00:05:36.330> won't<00:05:36.599> use<00:05:36.870> anywhere

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
ignition bubble which won't use anywhere

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.469 
ignition bubble which won't use anywhere
because<00:05:37.409> that<00:05:38.039> was<00:05:38.219> cheap<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.819> a<00:05:38.849> god<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.120> EB<00:05:39.449> a

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
done the forks are basically done in

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.439 
done the forks are basically done in
other<00:05:52.800> than<00:05:52.979> this<00:05:53.159> bit<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.699> the<00:05:54.060> other<00:05:54.270> bit

the rest of the kit just bolts on the
original<00:05:56.969> ball<00:05:57.300> tools<00:05:57.630> around<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:58.050> frame<00:05:58.289> so

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
original ball tools around the frame so

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.670 
original ball tools around the frame so
don't<00:05:58.949> have<00:05:59.039> to<00:05:59.159> worry<00:05:59.310> about<00:05:59.460> that<00:05:59.849> and<00:06:00.680> yeah

I'm happy of the progress which is
happening<00:06:04.560> with<00:06:04.650> this<00:06:04.770> bike<00:06:05.039> and<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.729> engine

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
happening with this bike and the engine

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.870 
happening with this bike and the engine
I<00:06:06.180> haven't<00:06:06.479> touched<00:06:06.630> yet<00:06:07.310> I'm<00:06:08.310> going<00:06:08.520> to<00:06:08.669> try

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
I haven't touched yet I'm going to try

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.969 
I haven't touched yet I'm going to try
and<00:06:09.029> leave<00:06:09.210> that<00:06:09.449> till<00:06:09.690> the<00:06:09.840> end<00:06:09.990> because<00:06:10.199> the

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
and leave that till the end because the

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.129 
and leave that till the end because the
engine<00:06:11.370> side<00:06:11.849> of<00:06:12.029> it<00:06:12.150> I<00:06:12.300> am<00:06:12.569> more<00:06:13.110> than

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
engine side of it I am more than

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.709 
engine side of it I am more than
comfortable<00:06:13.469> with<00:06:13.979> so<00:06:14.340> once<00:06:15.240> I've<00:06:15.509> got<00:06:15.690> all

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
comfortable with so once I've got all

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.600 
comfortable with so once I've got all
the<00:06:16.020> fabrications<00:06:16.770> done<00:06:17.130> on<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.460> bike

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
the fabrications done on the bike

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.450 
the fabrications done on the bike
basically<00:06:18.599> in<00:06:18.690> a<00:06:18.750> rolling<00:06:19.080> chassis<00:06:19.289> form<00:06:19.770> I'll

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
basically in a rolling chassis form I'll

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.550 
basically in a rolling chassis form I'll
then<00:06:20.849> move<00:06:21.090> on<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.449> engine<00:06:21.900> and<00:06:21.960> start<00:06:22.319> going

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
then move on the engine and start going

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.559 
then move on the engine and start going
through<00:06:22.650> all<00:06:22.830> that<00:06:23.159> so<00:06:23.490> if<00:06:23.759> he's<00:06:24.210> waiting<00:06:24.419> for

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
through all that so if he's waiting for

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.029 
through all that so if he's waiting for
the<00:06:24.719> engine<00:06:25.080> part<00:06:25.289> the<00:06:25.380> bill<00:06:25.560> that<00:06:25.770> will<00:06:25.860> come

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
the engine part the bill that will come

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.140 
the engine part the bill that will come
towards<00:06:26.279> the<00:06:26.580> end<00:06:26.729> of<00:06:26.819> the<00:06:26.909> project<00:06:27.529> and

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
towards the end of the project and

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.399 
towards the end of the project and
radiator<00:06:30.150> I'm<00:06:30.449> hoping<00:06:30.750> it's<00:06:31.020> going<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:31.259> work

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
radiator I'm hoping it's going to work

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.070 
radiator I'm hoping it's going to work
in<00:06:31.830> I<00:06:32.190> can't<00:06:32.490> see<00:06:32.699> any<00:06:32.849> noticeable<00:06:33.599> points

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
in I can't see any noticeable points

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.389 
in I can't see any noticeable points
where<00:06:34.229> it<00:06:34.289> will<00:06:34.380> be<00:06:34.529> leaking<00:06:34.919> but<00:06:35.130> can't

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:35.399 
where it will be leaking but can't

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.649 
where it will be leaking but can't
really<00:06:35.699> see<00:06:35.909> that<00:06:36.060> until<00:06:36.330> it's<00:06:36.509> actually

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
really see that until it's actually

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.920 
really see that until it's actually
under<00:06:37.050> pressure<00:06:37.349> so<00:06:37.969> yeah<00:06:38.969> and<00:06:39.389> the<00:06:39.810> only

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
under pressure so yeah and the only

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.060 
under pressure so yeah and the only
thing<00:06:40.169> going<00:06:40.199> to<00:06:40.469> really<00:06:40.740> do

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
thing going to really do

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.490 
thing going to really do
go<00:06:41.640> off<00:06:41.700> with<00:06:41.970> away<00:06:42.180> a<00:06:42.210> bush<00:06:42.540> on<00:06:42.780> the<00:06:43.020> outer

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
go off with away a bush on the outer

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.380 
go off with away a bush on the outer
paths<00:06:43.860> and<00:06:44.130> bisque<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:44.580> spirit<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.210> map

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390
