and<00:00:26.960> basically<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> upper<00:00:28.410> control<00:00:28.500> arm<00:00:28.949> now

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and basically the upper control arm now

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
and basically the upper control arm now
is<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.820> control<00:00:30.119> arm<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> doesn't<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.779> any

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
is just a control arm it doesn't do any

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
is just a control arm it doesn't do any
dampening<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:32.250> takes<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> place<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
dampening this takes the place of the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.049 
dampening this takes the place of the
rigid<00:00:33.719> lever<00:00:34.680> shock<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:35.399> used<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.850> right

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
rigid lever shock which used to be right

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.310 
rigid lever shock which used to be right
here<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:38.239> now<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.480> sort<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> dual

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
here and now it's sort of got this dual

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.139 
here and now it's sort of got this dual
arm<00:00:40.760> setup<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.750> still<00:00:43.020> pivot<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:44.190> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
arm setup it can still pivot on this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.150 
arm setup it can still pivot on this
trunnion<00:00:45.450> bushing<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:49.829> wheel<00:00:49.980> can

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
trunnion bushing here and the wheel can

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.200 
trunnion bushing here and the wheel can
still<00:00:50.930> pivot<00:00:51.930> freely<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> tube<00:00:53.850> shock

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
still pivot freely there the tube shock

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.869 
still pivot freely there the tube shock
needed<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.110> installed<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.949> there's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
needed to be installed because there's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.099 
needed to be installed because there's
no<00:00:57.030> dampening<00:00:57.480> anymore<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.199> new<00:00:59.030> arm

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
no dampening anymore with this new arm

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.189 
no dampening anymore with this new arm
so<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.140> create<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.219> shock<00:01:02.520> tower<00:01:02.989> up<00:01:03.989> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
so we create a little shock tower up in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.440 
so we create a little shock tower up in
the<00:01:04.290> top<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.000> tacked<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.420> place

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the top and it's just tacked in place

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
the top and it's just tacked in place
right<00:01:06.930> now

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
right now

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
right now
once<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.000> tacked<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.510> place<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.990> could

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
once that was tacked in place we could

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.950 
once that was tacked in place we could
get<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.729> alignment<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.240> bottom<00:01:12.659> post

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
get the alignment for this bottom post

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.640 
get the alignment for this bottom post
which<00:01:13.729> we<00:01:14.729> created<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.210> by<00:01:16.610> welding<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> rod

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
which we created just by welding a rod

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.690 
which we created just by welding a rod
to<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:20.189> plate<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.659> drilled<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
to this plate that I drilled and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.789 
to this plate that I drilled and
attached<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> lower<00:01:24.180> control<00:01:24.570> arm<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
attached to the lower control arm it's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
attached to the lower control arm it's
kind<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.580> system<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.090> Moss<00:01:27.689> motor

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
kind of like the system that Moss motor

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.410 
kind of like the system that Moss motor
sells<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:29.009> simpler

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
sells just a little bit simpler

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.060 
sells just a little bit simpler
hopefully<00:01:30.420> that'll<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.750> enough<00:01:32.479> strength<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
hopefully that'll be enough strength to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
hopefully that'll be enough strength to
do<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> work<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.670> needs<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.090> but

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
do the work that it needs to do but

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.990 
do the work that it needs to do but
that's<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.829> looks<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.970> just

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that's what it looks like and I just

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.820 
that's what it looks like and I just
need<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> weld<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.780> place<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.460> you're<00:01:41.460> done

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.770 

see<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:49.010> that's<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.430> wheel<00:01:49.670> that's<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.390> tire

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.640 

before<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:53.810> welded<00:01:54.470> up<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.280> shock<00:01:55.940> tower<00:01:56.240> I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
before I welded up the shock tower I

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.470 
before I welded up the shock tower I
should<00:01:57.650> have<00:01:57.740> tried<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.070> put<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.700> wheel<00:01:58.880> on

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.760 

because<00:02:02.480> as<00:02:02.720> soon<00:02:02.900> as<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.110> did<00:02:03.320> put<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.620> wheel

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
because as soon as I did put the wheel

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.130 
because as soon as I did put the wheel
and<00:02:03.980> tire<00:02:04.160> on<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.760> realized<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.720> place<00:02:05.930> I

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
and tire on I realized that the place I

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.450 
and tire on I realized that the place I
had<00:02:06.260> mounted<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.740> shock<00:02:06.950> before<00:02:07.240> did<00:02:08.240> not<00:02:08.420> fit

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
had mounted the shock before did not fit

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.730 
had mounted the shock before did not fit
so<00:02:10.460> that<00:02:11.060> got<00:02:11.270> cut<00:02:11.480> out<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.370> see<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> old

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
so that got cut out you can see the old

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.860 
so that got cut out you can see the old
weld<00:02:15.740> line<00:02:16.010> right<00:02:16.310> there<00:02:16.550> had<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.450> move<00:02:17.720> it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
weld line right there had to move it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.290 
weld line right there had to move it
over<00:02:17.960> quite<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.350> bit<00:02:18.880> right<00:02:19.880> now<00:02:20.030> it's<00:02:20.240> just

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
over quite a bit right now it's just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.950 
over quite a bit right now it's just
tacked<00:02:20.630> in<00:02:20.810> place<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:23.180> wheel<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.570> all<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
tacked in place but the wheel is all the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.790 
tacked in place but the wheel is all the
way<00:02:24.790> turn<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> left<00:02:26.210> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.320> see<00:02:27.380> there's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
way turn to the left you can see there's

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.090 
way turn to the left you can see there's
a<00:02:27.860> gap<00:02:28.250> there<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:30.020> wheel<00:02:30.170> turns<00:02:30.530> nice<00:02:30.830> and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
a gap there and the wheel turns nice and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.480 
a gap there and the wheel turns nice and
free<00:02:32.200> very<00:02:33.200> smoothly<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.770> might<00:02:34.010> say<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
free very smoothly I might say on the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.940 
free very smoothly I might say on the
new<00:02:34.640> bearings<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.330> put<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:36.800> think

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
new bearings I just put in so I think

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.630 
new bearings I just put in so I think
now<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.520> shock<00:02:38.360> tower<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.050> lower<00:02:40.040> mount<00:02:40.370> are

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
now the shock tower and lower mount are

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.630 
now the shock tower and lower mount are
done<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.680> hope

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.770 

well<00:02:49.640> hmm

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
well hmm

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.010 
well hmm
that<00:02:50.960> should<00:02:51.260> do<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:54.820> finished

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
that should do it this is the finished

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.380 
that should do it this is the finished
modified<00:02:57.020> custom<00:02:57.680> suspension<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.640> then<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
modified custom suspension and then the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
modified custom suspension and then the
shock<00:02:59.630> tower<00:02:59.900> up<00:03:00.200> here<00:03:02.350> just<00:03:04.240> is<00:03:05.240> welded<00:03:06.170> to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
shock tower up here just is welded to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.060 
shock tower up here just is welded to
the<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:08.720> was<00:03:08.870> kind<00:03:09.050> of<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.200> double<00:03:09.500> thick<00:03:09.710> plate

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
the it was kind of a double thick plate

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.000 
the it was kind of a double thick plate
here<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.660> was<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.050> sprite<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.710> begin

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
here that was on the sprite to begin

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.880 
here that was on the sprite to begin
with<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.430> only<00:03:13.760> weld<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.270> that<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.890> figured

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
with so I only weld it to that I figured

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.260 
with so I only weld it to that I figured
I<00:03:15.980> wasn't<00:03:16.160> going<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.430> get<00:03:16.550> much<00:03:16.730> structural

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
I wasn't going to get much structural

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.810 
I wasn't going to get much structural
integrity<00:03:17.600> out<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.080> that<00:03:18.890> inner<00:03:19.130> fender<00:03:19.610> well

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
integrity out of that inner fender well

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.220 
integrity out of that inner fender well
so<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:22.450> attached<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:24.730> existing<00:03:26.230> rigidity

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
so I attached it to existing rigidity

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.470 
so I attached it to existing rigidity
you<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:27.770> see<00:03:28.900> there's<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.820> ill-fated<00:03:31.820> weld

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
you can see there's the ill-fated weld

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.270 
you can see there's the ill-fated weld
that<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.780> had<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.050> cut<00:03:33.260> out<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.590> morning<00:03:34.070> and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
that I had to cut out this morning and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.520 
that I had to cut out this morning and
redo<00:03:35.860> but<00:03:36.860> it's<00:03:36.980> done<00:03:38.080> now<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.110> just<00:03:39.170> need<00:03:39.410> to

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
redo but it's done now I just need to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.580 
redo but it's done now I just need to
pop<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.860> spring<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:42.110> can<00:03:42.350> put<00:03:42.470> some

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
pop the spring in and I can put some

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.709 
pop the spring in and I can put some
wheels<00:03:42.770> on<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.100> thing<00:03:44.560> good<00:03:45.560> night
