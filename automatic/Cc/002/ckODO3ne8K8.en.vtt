00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
dungeon which is for the most part a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.850 
dungeon which is for the most part a
tank<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.000> spank<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.660> spawns<00:00:09.960> ads<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.590> believe

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
tank and spank the spawns ads I believe

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.020 
tank and spank the spawns ads I believe
you<00:00:10.980> should<00:00:11.040> be<00:00:11.250> able<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.460> close<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.670> gates

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
you should be able to close the gates

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.360 
you should be able to close the gates
stop<00:00:12.840> them<00:00:13.019> spawning<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.860> don't<00:00:14.070> actually

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
stop them spawning but I don't actually

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.279 
stop them spawning but I don't actually
try<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.120> our<00:00:15.540> tank<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.080> just

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
try that because our tank is just

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.429 
try that because our tank is just
beastmode<00:00:16.789> so<00:00:17.789> let's<00:00:18.090> talk<00:00:18.240> about<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.810> I

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
beastmode so let's talk about this I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.230 
beastmode so let's talk about this I
guess<00:00:20.279> some<00:00:20.460> people<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:20.730> calling<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
guess some people are calling this a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.210 
guess some people are calling this a
disastrous<00:00:21.930> launch<00:00:22.289> although<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> kind<00:00:23.160> of

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
disastrous launch although I kind of

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.370 
disastrous launch although I kind of
disagree<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:24.060> was<00:00:24.630> finally<00:00:24.810> able<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.289> into

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
disagree I was finally able to get into

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
disagree I was finally able to get into
duty<00:00:25.710> finder<00:00:25.920> after<00:00:26.460> about<00:00:26.609> an<00:00:26.730> hour<00:00:26.760> waiting

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
duty finder after about an hour waiting

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.810 
duty finder after about an hour waiting
I<00:00:27.779> think<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.830> might<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.010> over<00:00:29.279> exaggeration

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I think that might be over exaggeration

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.370 
I think that might be over exaggeration
I<00:00:30.029> did<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> lot<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.449> crafting<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.109> got<00:00:31.289> my

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I did a lot of crafting I got my

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.530 
I did a lot of crafting I got my
crafting<00:00:31.769> up<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> level<00:00:32.279> 12<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.300> tailor

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
crafting up the level 12 for my tailor

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.479 
crafting up the level 12 for my tailor
so<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> did<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.770> much<00:00:35.130> work<00:00:35.610> um<00:00:36.230> basically

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
so I did that much work um basically

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.830 
so I did that much work um basically
duty<00:00:38.489> finders<00:00:38.910> kind<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.210> screwed<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.660> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
duty finders kind of screwed up so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.940 
duty finders kind of screwed up so
therefore<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.379> hard<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.620> progress<00:00:40.890> through

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
therefore it's hard to progress through

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190 
therefore it's hard to progress through
story<00:00:41.370> mode<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.149> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> look<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.989> my

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
story mode you can see if you look on my

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
story mode you can see if you look on my
right<00:00:43.649> side<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.890> my<00:00:43.980> screen<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.370> did<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.850> get

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
right side of my screen I did not get

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
right side of my screen I did not get
credit<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.600> joining<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.230> duty<00:00:46.530> finder

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
credit for joining this do duty finder

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.830 
credit for joining this do duty finder
so<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.610> looks<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.850> i<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> repeat<00:00:48.690> this

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
so it looks like i get to repeat this

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
so it looks like i get to repeat this
goddamn<00:00:49.500> thing<00:00:49.620> again<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.640> means<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> get

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
goddamn thing again so I means to get

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.330 
goddamn thing again so I means to get
more<00:00:51.030> looting<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> possibly<00:00:53.010> more

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
more looting out of it possibly more

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 
more looting out of it possibly more
experience<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.660> paying<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> ask<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
experience that's paying the ask is a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.240 
experience that's paying the ask is a
long<00:00:55.890> wait<00:00:56.219> period<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> big<00:00:58.800> chunk

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
long wait period and this is a big chunk

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
long wait period and this is a big chunk
of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> game<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.059> therefore<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> can't<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.379> my

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
of the game and therefore I can't get my

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.840 
of the game and therefore I can't get my
mouth<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.010> can't<00:01:02.309> progress<00:01:02.460> through<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.820> story

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
mouth I can't progress through the story

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
mouth I can't progress through the story
so<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> stuck<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.140> level<00:01:04.260> 20<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.220> my

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so I'm kind of stuck at level 20 for my

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.460 
so I'm kind of stuck at level 20 for my
Arcana<00:01:05.820> psych<00:01:06.090> level<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.540> other<00:01:06.689> classes<00:01:06.990> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
Arcana psych level my other classes but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.570 
Arcana psych level my other classes but
why<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> hell<00:01:07.890> would<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.070> want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
why the hell would I want to do that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.789 
why the hell would I want to do that
because<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.180> Sumner<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.840> don't<00:01:10.710> really

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
because I'm going Sumner I don't really

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.740 
because I'm going Sumner I don't really
think<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.580> disastrous<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> launch

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
think this is to disastrous of a launch

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.520 
think this is to disastrous of a launch
it's<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> most<00:01:13.860> part<00:01:15.320> it's<00:01:16.320> not

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's just for the most part it's not

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
it's just for the most part it's not

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that i'm not a network technician so I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.460 
that i'm not a network technician so I
can't<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.600> say<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> hell<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.290> wrong

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
can't really say what the hell is wrong

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.080 
can't really say what the hell is wrong
but<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.939> pre-launch<00:01:57.829> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.130> time<00:01:59.850> for

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
but I it's a pre-launch this is time for

but I it's a pre-launch this is time for
them<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> weeded<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.380> could<00:02:01.560> argue<00:02:01.710> shad

this<00:02:02.490> fix<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> beta<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.540> alpha<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.259> they

this fix and beta and alpha but they

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.810 
this fix and beta and alpha but they
really<00:02:04.860> they<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.159> these<00:02:05.369> problems<00:02:05.549> with

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
really they have these problems with

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.359 
really they have these problems with
beta<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.240> alpha<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.659> played<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.190> reason

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
beta and alpha I played that the reason

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.559 
beta and alpha I played that the reason
why<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> problem<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.119> because<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
why it's the problem is because this is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
why it's the problem is because this is
a<00:02:09.599> lot<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:09.899> players<00:02:10.470> than<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:11.009> had<00:02:11.220> during
