me<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:17.970> welcome<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> program<00:00:18.779> thank<00:00:19.109> you

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
me now welcome to the program thank you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.870 
me now welcome to the program thank you
I<00:00:19.560> always<00:00:19.800> thought<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.039> forest<00:00:20.460> fires<00:00:20.640> were

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
I always thought that forest fires were

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.460 
I always thought that forest fires were
completely<00:00:21.270> unpredictable<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.289> guess

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
completely unpredictable but I guess

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.620 
completely unpredictable but I guess
that's<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.830> entirely<00:00:23.340> self<00:00:23.760> yeah<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.539> are

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that's not entirely self yeah they are

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
that's not entirely self yeah they are
pretty<00:00:24.689> unpredictable<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.680> there<00:00:26.189> are

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
pretty unpredictable but there are

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.710 
pretty unpredictable but there are
there's<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> people<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> world

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
there's a lot of people in the world

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.109 
there's a lot of people in the world
working<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.400> make<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.760> predict

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
working on how do we make to predict

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
working on how do we make to predict
them<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:30.779> has<00:00:31.500> been<00:00:31.529> lots<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.980> researchers

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
them there has been lots of researchers

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.930 
them there has been lots of researchers
around<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> world<00:00:33.149> trying<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.899> study<00:00:34.880> how<00:00:35.880> we

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
around the world trying to study how we

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.799 
around the world trying to study how we
can<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:37.170> predict<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.329> word<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> fighters

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
can do to predict the word the fighters

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.770 
can do to predict the word the fighters
going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.320> based<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.860> soil<00:00:41.820> conditions<00:00:42.450> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
going to go based on soil conditions of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
going to go based on soil conditions of
weather<00:00:43.050> wind<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.309> slope<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> terrain

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
weather wind the slope of the terrain

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.529 
weather wind the slope of the terrain
and<00:00:45.510> there<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.140> good<00:00:47.039> models<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:48.510> are

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and there are very good models that are

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.810 
and there are very good models that are
being<00:00:48.870> used<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.289> helping<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> firefighters

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
being used for helping the firefighters

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.330 
being used for helping the firefighters
to<00:00:50.940> fight<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.899> fire<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> all

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to fight the fire in this this is all

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.740 
to fight the fire in this this is all
very<00:00:53.370> important<00:00:53.940> both<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.180> terms<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.719> know

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
very important both in terms of you know

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.209 
very important both in terms of you know
where<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> put<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.350> resources<00:00:55.890> where<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
where you put your resources where you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.130 
where you put your resources where you
put<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.430> manpower<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.059> also<00:00:57.239> whether<00:00:57.870> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
put your manpower but also whether it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
put your manpower but also whether it's
going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.440> necessary<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> evacuate<00:00:59.820> people

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
going to be necessary to evacuate people

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
going to be necessary to evacuate people
from<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.390> commute<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.899> community<00:01:01.079> excited

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
from a commute from a community excited

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
from a commute from a community excited
yeah<00:01:02.129> yeah<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.789> let's<00:01:03.000> give<00:01:03.390> us<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
yeah yeah all right so let's give us a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.759 
yeah yeah all right so let's give us a
sensor<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.930> got<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> big<00:01:04.260> screen<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.739> here

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
sensor we got the big screen up here

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
sensor we got the big screen up here
like<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.369> give<00:01:05.820> us<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.000> sense<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.390> what

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
like that give us a sense of what

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200 
like that give us a sense of what
your<00:01:06.930> technology<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.700> main<00:01:08.850> idea<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
your technology so the the main idea is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.960 
your technology so the the main idea is
that<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.490> currently<00:01:11.490> currently

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that if you see currently currently

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.050 
that if you see currently currently
existing<00:01:12.570> firefighting<00:01:13.500> technology<00:01:14.060> there

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
existing firefighting technology there

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
existing firefighting technology there
are<00:01:15.150> fairly<00:01:15.540> complex<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.259> build<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.979> are

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
are fairly complex to build there are

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
are fairly complex to build there are
very<00:01:17.939> large<00:01:18.180> programs<00:01:18.750> what<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.530> done<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
very large programs what we have done is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
very large programs what we have done is
we<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.009> developed<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> methodology<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
we have developed a methodology that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.740 
we have developed a methodology that
makes<00:01:21.990> everyone<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.340> able<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.820> create<00:01:24.270> very

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
makes everyone to be able to create very

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.310 
makes everyone to be able to create very
complex<00:01:26.420> simulations<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:28.080> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
complex simulations like this one in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.039 
complex simulations like this one in
very<00:01:28.740> simple<00:01:28.979> terms<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.689> for

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
very simple terms so if you see for

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.359 
very simple terms so if you see for
instance<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.380> screen<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.159> here

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
instance the screen that we have here

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.550 
instance the screen that we have here
all<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
all of that we are going to see is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.740 
all of that we are going to see is
defined<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.369> page<00:01:35.640> when<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> compare

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
defined in one page when you compare

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.940 
defined in one page when you compare
with<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> current<00:01:37.259> technology<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
with the current technology in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
with the current technology in
firefighting<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.790> are<00:01:38.880> hundreds<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> pages

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
firefighting there are hundreds of pages

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.160 
firefighting there are hundreds of pages
of<00:01:40.130> code<00:01:41.130> programming<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.930> this

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
of code programming so in this

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
of code programming so in this
particular<00:01:43.350> example<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.700> done<00:01:44.850> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
particular example what we have done is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.319 
particular example what we have done is
there's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.140> piece<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> terrain<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
there's a piece of terrain in in the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
there's a piece of terrain in in the
middle<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> woods<00:01:48.930> there's<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> lightning

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
middle of the woods there's a lightning

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.490 
middle of the woods there's a lightning
bolt<00:01:50.399> over<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.939> okay<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.170> wind

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
bolt over there okay and there's a wind

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.100 
bolt over there okay and there's a wind
going<00:01:52.860> from<00:01:53.100> Southwest<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> Northeast<00:01:54.659> okay

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
going from Southwest to Northeast okay

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.910 
going from Southwest to Northeast okay
so<00:01:55.799> by<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:57.240> running<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> model<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.770> we

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so by just running the model that we

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
so by just running the model that we
have<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> previous<00:01:59.610> screen<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.750> see

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
have in the previous screen we can see

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.039 
have in the previous screen we can see
how<00:02:01.259> fire<00:02:01.560> starting<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.969> model<00:02:03.329> accurately

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
how fire starting this model accurately

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.670 
how fire starting this model accurately
reproduces<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> actual<00:02:05.390> conditions<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.680> on

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
reproduces the actual conditions on on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.230 
reproduces the actual conditions on on
the<00:02:08.099> field

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
the field

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.600 
the field
and<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.860> main<00:02:10.860> advantage<00:02:11.010> of<00:02:11.430> this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and the main advantage of this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
and the main advantage of this
technology<00:02:11.970> compared<00:02:12.600> with<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> others<00:02:13.020> is

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
technology compared with the others is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.140 
technology compared with the others is
that<00:02:13.410> whenever<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.220> need<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.910> make<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that whenever you need to make a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
that whenever you need to make a
modification<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.320> those<00:02:16.590> programs

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
modification in one of those programs

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
modification in one of those programs
you<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.520> spend<00:02:17.820> lots<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.210> resources<00:02:18.540> lots

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
you have to spend lots of resources lots

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.280 
you have to spend lots of resources lots
of<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.860> other<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.970> our<00:02:21.120> case<00:02:21.480> by<00:02:21.930> just

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
of time in other in in our case by just

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.010 
of time in other in in our case by just
modifying<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.890> few<00:02:23.190> lines<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:24.020> program

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
modifying a few lines in that program

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.950 
modifying a few lines in that program
that<00:02:25.290> i<00:02:25.380> showed<00:02:25.560> before<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:27.090> able<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.840> do

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
that i showed before you are able to do

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.930 
that i showed before you are able to do
much<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.650> complex<00:02:28.980> things<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.490> were<00:02:29.670> never

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
much more complex things that were never

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.510 
much more complex things that were never
done<00:02:30.210> before<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.870> give<00:02:31.020> your<00:02:31.650> example<00:02:32.130> here<00:02:32.310> in

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
done before we give your example here in

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.970 
done before we give your example here in
this<00:02:32.730> case<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.330> see<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> very<00:02:34.800> few

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
this case if you see with a very few

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.100 
this case if you see with a very few
modifications<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.850> one<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.870> see

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
modifications in that one you can see

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.380 
modifications in that one you can see
firefighters<00:02:37.490> starting<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.670> attack<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> fire

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
firefighters starting to attack the fire

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.420 
firefighters starting to attack the fire
okay<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.140> can<00:02:40.380> study<00:02:41.040> different

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
okay and you can study different

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.320 
okay and you can study different
possibilities<00:02:42.270> on<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> attack<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
possibilities on the attack so in this

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.240 
possibilities on the attack so in this
case<00:02:45.570> if<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.380> have<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> technique<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.100> you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
case if you have the technique that you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.340 
case if you have the technique that you
have<00:02:47.460> people<00:02:48.450> living<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:48.960> area<00:02:49.140> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
have people living in this area you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.450 
have people living in this area you
could<00:02:49.710> add<00:02:50.370> online<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.570> see<00:02:51.810> how<00:02:52.350> it's<00:02:53.190> going

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
could add online to see how it's going

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.330 
could add online to see how it's going
to<00:02:53.580> be<00:02:53.700> handled<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.360> there's<00:02:55.320> another<00:02:55.980> third

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to be handled and there's another third

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.470 
to be handled and there's another third
case<00:02:57.020> here<00:02:58.020> we<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:59.340> same<00:02:59.610> fire<00:02:59.880> but<00:03:00.240> what

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
case here we have the same fire but what

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.340 
case here we have the same fire but what
happens<00:03:00.780> if<00:03:00.930> starts<00:03:01.350> raining<00:03:01.740> okay<00:03:02.130> okay<00:03:02.250> so

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
happens if starts raining okay okay so

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.950 
happens if starts raining okay okay so
the<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.950> big<00:03:05.100> advantages<00:03:05.720> advantage<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.840> this

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
the the big advantages advantage of this

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.890 
the the big advantages advantage of this
is<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.410> if<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.940> cloud<00:03:09.870> came

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
is a if you see this is a cloud came

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.370 
is a if you see this is a cloud came
started<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.860> rain<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.520> fire<00:03:11.550> start<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:13.170> put

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
started to rain the fire start to be put

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.080 
started to rain the fire start to be put
out<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:16.250> between<00:03:17.250> one<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.610> other<00:03:17.700> we

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
out the between one and the other we

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.240 
out the between one and the other we
just<00:03:18.360> change<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.780> couple<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.560> very<00:03:19.860> simple

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
just change a couple of very simple

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.790 
just change a couple of very simple
lines<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:21.120> are<00:03:21.180> able<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.540> reproduce<00:03:21.870> these

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
lines and we are able to reproduce these

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.580 
lines and we are able to reproduce these
more<00:03:23.100> much<00:03:23.400> more<00:03:23.580> complex<00:03:24.410> behavior<00:03:25.410> yeah<00:03:25.560> I

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
more much more complex behavior yeah I

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.990 
more much more complex behavior yeah I
made<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.340> silly<00:03:26.520> remark<00:03:26.880> about

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
made a kind of silly remark about

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.760 
made a kind of silly remark about
firefighters<00:03:27.600> throwing<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.140> their<00:03:28.290> backpack

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
firefighters throwing in their backpack

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.620 
firefighters throwing in their backpack
it's<00:03:29.550> not<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.850> be<00:03:29.940> used<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.330> field<00:03:30.510> but

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
it's not to be used in the field but

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.970 
it's not to be used in the field but
somebody<00:03:30.900> back<00:03:31.050> at<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.350> command<00:03:31.800> center

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
somebody back at the command center

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.650 
somebody back at the command center
could<00:03:32.310> say<00:03:32.400> okay<00:03:32.670> attacker<00:03:33.270> from<00:03:33.480> this

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
could say okay attacker from this

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.180 
could say okay attacker from this
direction<00:03:33.840> from<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.410> annoyed<00:03:34.740> or<00:03:34.770> whatever

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
direction from this annoyed or whatever

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.250 
direction from this annoyed or whatever
and<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:36.060> idea<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.390> can<00:03:36.720> combine<00:03:36.930> these

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
and so the idea is you can combine these

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.140 
and so the idea is you can combine these
with<00:03:37.320> geographical<00:03:38.130> information<00:03:38.280> systems

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
with geographical information systems

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150

could<00:03:54.330> actually<00:03:54.600> be<00:03:54.870> used<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.290> know<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.710> been

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
could actually be used I know it's been

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.740 
could actually be used I know it's been
a<00:03:55.860> pretty<00:03:56.040> wet<00:03:56.280> cool<00:03:56.850> spring<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.480> we<00:03:57.540> haven't

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
a pretty wet cool spring and we haven't

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.000 
a pretty wet cool spring and we haven't
heard<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.050> lot<00:03:58.170> about<00:03:58.290> forest<00:03:58.680> fires<00:03:58.860> but

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
heard of a lot about forest fires but

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.770 
heard of a lot about forest fires but
could<00:03:59.520> it<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.210> point<00:04:00.360> now<00:04:00.540> where<00:04:00.570> it

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
could it is to the point now where it

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.910 
could it is to the point now where it
could<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:00.990> used<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.350> fighting<00:04:01.620> forest<00:04:01.830> fires

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
could be used in fighting forest fires

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.250 
could be used in fighting forest fires
in<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.400> part<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.670> yes<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:04.080> this

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
in this part of yes because this

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.900 
in this part of yes because this
particular<00:04:04.710> model<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.040> based<00:04:05.459> on<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.670> very

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
particular model is based on a very

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
particular model is based on a very
well-known<00:04:06.240> North<00:04:06.810> American<00:04:07.440> fire<00:04:08.010> forest

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
well-known North American fire forest

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.890 
well-known North American fire forest
method<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:11.370> we<00:04:11.549> have<00:04:11.730> implemented<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.659> our

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
method that we have implemented in our

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.170 
method that we have implemented in our
tools<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:13.469> it<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:14.010> good<00:04:14.189> thing<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.549> we

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
tools so it the good thing is that we

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.539 
tools so it the good thing is that we
could<00:04:15.420> start<00:04:15.840> with<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.289> existing<00:04:16.889> kind<00:04:17.459> of

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
could start with that existing kind of

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.120 
could start with that existing kind of
technology<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.269> move<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.320> better

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
technology and move it to a better

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.490 
technology and move it to a better
definition<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.419> other<00:04:21.840> condition<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.440> they

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
definition of other condition and they

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.439 
definition of other condition and they
say<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.740> same<00:04:22.860> approach<00:04:23.850> can<00:04:24.060> be<00:04:24.120> used<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
say the same approach can be used to

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.210 
say the same approach can be used to
predict<00:04:24.750> things<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.259> spread<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.620> toxic

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
predict things like the spread of toxic

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.950 
predict things like the spread of toxic
chemicals<00:04:26.400> if<00:04:26.880> there's<00:04:27.060> been<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.240> spill<00:04:27.630> or

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
chemicals if there's been a spill or

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.980 
chemicals if there's been a spill or
even<00:04:28.470> how<00:04:28.800> people<00:04:29.250> will<00:04:29.610> try<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.270> flee<00:04:30.660> from<00:04:30.810> a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
even how people will try to flee from a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.510 
even how people will try to flee from a
building<00:04:31.199> if<00:04:31.500> there's<00:04:31.680> an<00:04:31.830> emergency<00:04:31.919> and

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
building if there's an emergency and

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.070 
building if there's an emergency and
you're<00:04:32.699> able<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:33.000> do<00:04:33.120> all<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.330> yes<00:04:33.750> exactly

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
you're able to do all that yes exactly

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.580 
you're able to do all that yes exactly
yeah<00:04:34.410> because<00:04:35.370> our<00:04:36.030> research<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.780> not<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.320> the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
yeah because our research is not in the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.990 
yeah because our research is not in the
forest<00:04:37.830> fire<00:04:38.130> field<00:04:38.460> it's<00:04:38.699> in<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
forest fire field it's in the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.670 
forest fire field it's in the
methodology<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.600> we<00:04:39.750> use<00:04:40.139> to<00:04:40.350> build<00:04:40.500> this

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
methodology that we use to build this

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.560 
methodology that we use to build this
kind<00:04:40.919> of<00:04:40.979> simulations<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:41.970> we<00:04:42.120> have<00:04:42.300> built

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
kind of simulations so we have built

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.300 
kind of simulations so we have built
models<00:04:43.259> of<00:04:43.470> cars<00:04:44.160> moving<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.699> street

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
models of cars moving in the street
