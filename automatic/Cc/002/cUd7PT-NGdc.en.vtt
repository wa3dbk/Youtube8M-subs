the<00:01:40.329> cuticle<00:01:40.750> basically<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.709> outside<00:01:42.099> layer

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
the cuticle basically the outside layer

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.099 
the cuticle basically the outside layer
of<00:01:42.459> the<00:01:42.549> hair<00:01:42.670> shaft<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:43.390> make<00:01:43.539> it<00:01:43.659> seem<00:01:43.840> fuller

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
of the hair shaft to make it seem fuller

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.230 
of the hair shaft to make it seem fuller
and<00:01:44.439> thicker<00:01:44.469> and<00:01:45.099> plus<00:01:45.579> they<00:01:45.759> usually<00:01:45.939> add<00:01:46.209> a

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and thicker and plus they usually add a

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.910

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
little bit of hold to it so when you do

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.529
