problem when we move up to the BX 2 you
can<00:01:05.600> see<00:01:05.780> we've<00:01:06.229> got<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.410> larger<00:01:06.710> base<00:01:06.890> unit

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
can see we've got a larger base unit

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.940 
can see we've got a larger base unit
from<00:01:09.439> porting<00:01:10.270> same<00:01:11.270> tweeter

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
from porting same tweeter

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.140 
from porting same tweeter
until<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.100> larger<00:01:13.369> cabinet<00:01:13.760> with<00:01:13.850> larger

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.219 
until the larger cabinet with larger
base<00:01:14.299> unit<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.750> are<00:01:14.840> going<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.110> get

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
base unit you are going to get

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.310 
base unit you are going to get
additional<00:01:16.010> room<00:01:16.400> but<00:01:17.210> because<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.110> front

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
additional room but because the front

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.800 
additional room but because the front
porting<00:01:18.740> they<00:01:19.700> will<00:01:19.880> go<00:01:20.030> closer<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.630> wall

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
porting they will go closer to a wall

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.170 
porting they will go closer to a wall
than<00:01:21.530> these<00:01:21.680> will<00:01:21.890> which<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.460> very<00:01:23.030> useful

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
than these will which is very useful

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.690 
than these will which is very useful
because<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.659> actually<00:01:23.840> get<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:25.130> know<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.369> good

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
because you actually get you know a good

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.210 
because you actually get you know a good
size<00:01:25.970> speaker<00:01:26.479> in<00:01:27.259> an<00:01:27.380> environment<00:01:28.070> where<00:01:28.130> you

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
size speaker in an environment where you

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.800 
size speaker in an environment where you
may<00:01:28.369> need<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.880> get<00:01:28.970> close<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.479> wall<00:01:29.630> so

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
may need to get close to the wall so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.660 
may need to get close to the wall so
it's<00:01:29.960> quite<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.140> compatible<00:01:30.530> speaker<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.520> over

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
it's quite a compatible speaker and over

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.160 
it's quite a compatible speaker and over
the<00:01:31.820> back<00:01:33.430> they've<00:01:34.430> upgraded<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:35.060> by<00:01:35.659> wire<00:01:35.900> or

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
the back they've upgraded to by wire or

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.499 
the back they've upgraded to by wire or
by<00:01:36.799> amp<00:01:37.009> terminals<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:40.040> on<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.850> floor<00:01:41.060> stander

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
by amp terminals so on the floor stander

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.160 
by amp terminals so on the floor stander
which<00:01:42.049> is<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.460> very<00:01:43.460> very<00:01:43.880> good<00:01:44.210> speaker<00:01:44.720> now

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
which is a very very good speaker now

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.870 
which is a very very good speaker now
I'll<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.619> say<00:01:45.979> something<00:01:46.009> specifically

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
I'll just say something specifically

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.380 
I'll just say something specifically
about<00:01:47.030> compatibility<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.079> speaker<00:01:49.390> it's

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
about compatibility of this speaker it's

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.469 
about compatibility of this speaker it's
a<00:01:50.479> very<00:01:50.659> capable<00:01:50.869> speak<00:01:51.320> indeed<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.759> found

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
a very capable speak indeed and I found

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.590 
a very capable speak indeed and I found
that<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.750> works<00:01:53.930> extremely<00:01:54.680> well<00:01:55.009> with<00:01:55.600> for

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
that it works extremely well with for

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.830 
that it works extremely well with for
example<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.049> reader<00:01:57.259> Brio<00:01:57.560> our<00:01:57.860> amplifier

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
example the reader Brio our amplifier

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.700 
example the reader Brio our amplifier
that's<00:01:59.840> not<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.140> say<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.320> reading<00:02:00.590> a

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
that's not to say that reading a

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.770 
that's not to say that reading a
speaker's<00:02:01.040> tab<00:02:01.219> work<00:02:01.430> well<00:02:01.670> with<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.149> Brio

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
speaker's tab work well with the Brio

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.510 
speaker's tab work well with the Brio
ours<00:02:03.079> of<00:02:03.259> course<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:03.710> obviously<00:02:04.310> reading

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
ours of course but obviously reading

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.069 
ours of course but obviously reading
speakers<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.060> floor<00:02:05.270> stones<00:02:05.509> are<00:02:05.719> more

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
speakers and floor stones are more

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.680 
speakers and floor stones are more
expensive<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.670> an<00:02:08.030> extremely

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
expensive and this is an extremely

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.570 
expensive and this is an extremely
viable<00:02:09.440> or

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
viable or

our<00:02:14.900> amplifier<00:02:15.410> what<00:02:16.250> they've<00:02:16.370> done<00:02:16.520> here<00:02:16.810> is

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
our amplifier what they've done here is

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.390 
our amplifier what they've done here is
essentially<00:02:18.110> taken<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.800> base<00:02:18.980> units<00:02:19.310> from

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
essentially taken to the base units from

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.450 
essentially taken to the base units from
the<00:02:19.490> x1<00:02:20.170> put<00:02:21.170> them<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.380> parallel<00:02:21.710> here<00:02:21.740> again

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
the x1 put them in parallel here again

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.850 
the x1 put them in parallel here again
front<00:02:22.910> porting<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.750> sighting<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.470> not<00:02:24.620> really

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
front porting so sighting is not really

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.970 
front porting so sighting is not really

electronics extremely capable sound and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.010 
electronics extremely capable sound and
usually<00:02:46.340> very<00:02:46.970> easy<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.300> sighting<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
usually very easy to sighting in the
