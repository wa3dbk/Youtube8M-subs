I<00:00:29.840> would<00:00:30.840> disagree<00:00:30.990> something<00:00:31.830> about<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
I would disagree something about that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.360 
I would disagree something about that
sounds<00:00:32.550> wrong<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:32.940> no<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:34.070> that<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
sounds wrong but no it's that we know of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
sounds wrong but no it's that we know of
yeah<00:00:35.940> I've<00:00:36.239> never<00:00:36.750> been<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> career<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
yeah I've never been a career from the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
yeah I've never been a career from the
outside<00:00:37.890> that's<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> seems<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.700> assume

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
outside that's what it seems I assume

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
outside that's what it seems I assume
it's<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.540> there<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:39.899> ended<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> knife

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it's just there just ended a knife

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
it's just there just ended a knife
fighting<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.040> Starcraft<00:00:41.700> did<00:00:41.940> Shoeless<00:00:42.510> Joe

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
fighting and Starcraft did Shoeless Joe

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.860 
fighting and Starcraft did Shoeless Joe
Jackson<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:43.350> caught<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.430> happened<00:00:44.870> no

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
Jackson get caught or what happened no

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.250 
Jackson get caught or what happened no
so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> guess<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.090> still<00:00:48.450> unfolding<00:00:48.930> as

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so I guess it's it's still unfolding as

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080 
so I guess it's it's still unfolding as
we<00:00:49.289> speak<00:00:49.800> people<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.280> someone<00:00:50.489> did<00:00:50.760> make<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
we speak people if someone did make the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.600 
we speak people if someone did make the
comparison<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> black<00:00:56.100> sauce<00:00:56.280> compares

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
comparison to the black sauce compares

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.569 
comparison to the black sauce compares
because<00:00:56.820> people<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.329> being<00:00:57.539> like

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
because people are being like

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.709 
because people are being like
blackballed<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.850> like<00:00:59.940> outed<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.480> teams

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
