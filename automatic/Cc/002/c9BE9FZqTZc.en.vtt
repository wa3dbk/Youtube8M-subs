had<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> work<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.389> actually<00:00:12.660> get

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
had to do a bit of work to actually get

had to do a bit of work to actually get
it<00:00:13.200> working<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.889> turned<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:14.969> fact

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
it working it turned out to be in fact

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.210 
it working it turned out to be in fact
possible<00:00:15.389> now<00:00:16.260> many<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:16.980> seen

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
possible now many of you have seen

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.880 
possible now many of you have seen
videos<00:00:17.699> with<00:00:17.970> designs<00:00:18.449> being<00:00:18.869> shown<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.170> empty

videos with designs being shown in empty
worlds<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.609> probably<00:00:21.119> wondered<00:00:21.480> how<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> do

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
worlds and probably wondered how to do

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
worlds and probably wondered how to do
the<00:00:22.050> same<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.949> here<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.279> am<00:00:23.369> showing<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the same so here I am showing the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060 
the same so here I am showing the
absolute<00:00:24.660> simplest<00:00:25.080> way<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.289> accomplish<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
absolute simplest way to accomplish that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.150 
absolute simplest way to accomplish that
no<00:00:26.699> mods<00:00:26.939> no<00:00:27.480> tools<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.170> virtually<00:00:28.680> no<00:00:28.920> time

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
no mods no tools and virtually no time

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.669 
no mods no tools and virtually no time
needed<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.390> obviously<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.929> start<00:00:31.199> off<00:00:31.380> with

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
needed so obviously we start off with

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
needed so obviously we start off with
the<00:00:31.710> single-player<00:00:32.399> create<00:00:32.940> new<00:00:33.120> world<00:00:33.360> we

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the single-player create new world we

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440 
the single-player create new world we
want<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> game<00:00:34.680> mode<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.340> creative<00:00:36.149> with

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
want the game mode to be creative with

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.569 
want the game mode to be creative with
more<00:00:36.719> world<00:00:37.050> options<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:38.100> want<00:00:38.399> any

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
more world options we don't want any

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.490 
more world options we don't want any
structures<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.629> want<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.290> super

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
structures and we want it to be super

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.030 
structures and we want it to be super
flat<00:00:41.360> then<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:42.780> customized<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.890> have

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
flat then going into customized we have

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
flat then going into customized we have
the<00:00:44.250> selection<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> various<00:00:45.360> layers<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.989> here

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the selection of various layers in here

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
the selection of various layers in here
so<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.829> into<00:00:46.980> preset<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> actually

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
so we can go into preset and actually

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
so we can go into preset and actually
change<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.039> villager<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:50.550> just

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
change that up so the villager then just

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
change that up so the villager then just
means<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.420> villages<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.230> there<00:00:52.410> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
means we want villages to be there but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
means we want villages to be there but
we<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.190> don't<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.059> obviously<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
we just don't want them obviously so the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
we just don't want them obviously so the
first<00:00:55.469> number<00:00:55.620> over<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.309> number<00:00:56.579> two<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
first number over here the number two is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.619 
first number over here the number two is
just<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> film<00:00:59.309> version<00:00:59.550> number<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> guess

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
just the film version number I guess

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020 
just the film version number I guess
then<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> next<00:01:01.559> number<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.250> after<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
then the next number over here after the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
then the next number over here after the
semicolon<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.890> list<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.189> layers<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
semicolon is the list of layers so the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.450 
semicolon is the list of layers so the
seven<00:01:06.390> there<00:01:06.600> means<00:01:06.930> bedrock<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.770> layer<00:01:07.979> then

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
seven there means bedrock one layer then

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.710 
seven there means bedrock one layer then
two<00:01:09.619> layers<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.890> guess<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.280> two<00:01:11.460> blocks<00:01:11.790> high

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
two layers I guess or two blocks high

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.859 
two layers I guess or two blocks high
layer<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.530> dirt<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> single<00:01:15.509> layer<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
layer of dirt and then a single layer of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.700 
layer of dirt and then a single layer of
grass<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.229> biome

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
grass and that one is actually the biome

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.330 
grass and that one is actually the biome
number<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.700> number<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.119> plains<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.950> can

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
number so number one is plains so we can

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.249 
number so number one is plains so we can
actually<00:01:23.460> only<00:01:23.820> remove<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.630> set<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
actually only remove that and set this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.130 
actually only remove that and set this
to<00:01:25.500> zero<00:01:25.939> actually<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.000> Minecraft<00:01:27.450> error<00:01:27.780> does

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to zero actually in Minecraft error does

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.359 
to zero actually in Minecraft error does
have<00:01:28.470> an<00:01:28.860> ID<00:01:29.009> code<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.700> ID<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.390> zero

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
have an ID code and that ID is zero

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
have an ID code and that ID is zero
meaning<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.659> use

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
meaning that if we do this and use

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.920 
meaning that if we do this and use
preset<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.310> layer<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.180> error<00:01:36.570> as

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
preset will have an layer of error as

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.789 
preset will have an layer of error as
you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.650> imagine<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.100> gray<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.790> an<00:01:39.060> empty

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
you can imagine this gray just an empty

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.889 
you can imagine this gray just an empty
area<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.400> furthermore<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.479> into<00:01:42.689> here

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
area but furthermore we can go into here

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
area but furthermore we can go into here
notice<00:01:43.259> they've<00:01:43.829> added<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.549> more

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
notice they've added a bit more

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.450 
notice they've added a bit more
information<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.280> set

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
information here and that one just set

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
information here and that one just set
it<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.700> planes<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:48.899> change

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it to planes but we can actually change

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.170 
it to planes but we can actually change
this<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.829> set<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> bomb<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.759> whatever<00:01:51.000> we

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
this and set the bomb to be whatever we

this and set the bomb to be whatever we
want<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:52.049> our<00:01:52.350> design<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.759> use<00:01:53.909> 0<00:01:54.329> for

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
want for our design so you can use 0 for

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
want for our design so you can use 0 for
ocean<00:01:55.229> meaning<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.610> works<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.149> or

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
ocean meaning you know it works more or

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
ocean meaning you know it works more or
less<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.540> planes<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.229> want<00:01:58.409> one

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
less like planes if you want one

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.520 
less like planes if you want one
explains<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.549> fine<00:01:59.790> that's<00:02:00.000> default<00:02:00.689> but

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
explains that's fine that's default but

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
explains that's fine that's default but
you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.710> also<00:02:01.920> use<00:02:02.189> 12<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:03.180> ice<00:02:03.450> Plains

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you can also use 12 for ice Plains

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600 
you can also use 12 for ice Plains
meaning<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.770> you're<00:02:04.920> doing<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> nice

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
meaning that if you're doing like a nice

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.219 
meaning that if you're doing like a nice
form<00:02:05.939> or<00:02:06.119> something<00:02:06.450> where<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> want<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.079> know

form or something where you want to know

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.990 
form or something where you want to know
you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.619> set<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> ice<00:02:08.220> Plains<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you can set it to ice Plains and you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.080 
you can set it to ice Plains and you
have<00:02:09.270> snow<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.899> water<00:02:10.080> freezing<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.910> use

about<00:02:16.959> mushroom<00:02:17.290> island<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:18.040> would<00:02:18.250> give

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
about mushroom island that would give

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.479 
about mushroom island that would give
you<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.700> mushroom<00:02:19.299> island<00:02:19.540> biome<00:02:20.340> then<00:02:21.340> you

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
you the mushroom island biome then you

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.059 
you the mushroom island biome then you
can<00:02:21.610> also<00:02:21.760> use<00:02:22.000> 8<00:02:22.299> as<00:02:22.480> nother<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.620> would<00:02:23.860> make

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
can also use 8 as nother this would make

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.250 
can also use 8 as nother this would make
the<00:02:24.340> overworld<00:02:24.940> actually<00:02:25.540> more<00:02:25.900> or<00:02:25.959> less<00:02:26.080> be

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
the overworld actually more or less be

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.930 
the overworld actually more or less be
considered<00:02:26.650> as<00:02:26.860> part<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.430> nether<00:02:27.670> and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
considered as part of the nether and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.940 
considered as part of the nether and
while<00:02:28.330> there<00:02:28.540> won't<00:02:28.690> be<00:02:28.930> any<00:02:30.090> nether<00:02:31.829> what<00:02:32.829> is

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
while there won't be any nether what is

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.800 
while there won't be any nether what is
it<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.519> know<00:02:33.640> actual<00:02:33.940> buildings<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.629> there

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it you know actual buildings and there

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.960 
it you know actual buildings and there
or<00:02:35.349> anything<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:35.799> that<00:02:35.950> with<00:02:36.310> fortresses

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
or anything like that with fortresses

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.240 
or anything like that with fortresses
what<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.690> will<00:02:37.930> do<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.110> allow<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.560> mobs<00:02:38.980> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
what this will do is allow the mobs and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.190 
what this will do is allow the mobs and
then<00:02:39.670> from<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.180> nether<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.629> actually<00:02:40.959> spawn

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
then from the nether to actually spawn

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.470 
then from the nether to actually spawn
and<00:02:41.409> their<00:02:41.560> meaning<00:02:41.920> you'd<00:02:42.069> get<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:43.360> know

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
and their meaning you'd get you know

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.710 
and their meaning you'd get you know
ghasts<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.560> zombie<00:02:45.519> pigmen<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.180> all<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
ghasts and zombie pigmen and all the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.990 
ghasts and zombie pigmen and all the
other<00:02:47.109> ones<00:02:47.410> from<00:02:47.620> there<00:02:47.859> you<00:02:48.579> can<00:02:48.640> also<00:02:48.849> use

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
other ones from there you can also use

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.619 
other ones from there you can also use
nine<00:02:49.629> as<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.079> end<00:02:50.620> which<00:02:51.250> will<00:02:51.459> enable<00:02:51.730> mobs

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
nine as the end which will enable mobs

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.110 
nine as the end which will enable mobs
like<00:02:53.079> you<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:53.829> interment<00:02:54.459> spawn<00:02:54.879> and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
like you know well interment spawn and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.229 
like you know well interment spawn and
that's<00:02:55.690> about<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.129> now<00:02:57.129> that<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.640> all<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:58.030> those

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
that's about it now that in all of those

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.649 
that's about it now that in all of those
cases<00:02:58.299> as<00:02:58.900> far<00:02:59.109> as<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.319> believe<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.730> mobs<00:03:01.180> won't

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
cases as far as I believe the mobs won't

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.910 
cases as far as I believe the mobs won't
spawn<00:03:02.049> if<00:03:02.440> light<00:03:03.099> level<00:03:03.489> is<00:03:03.819> you<00:03:04.599> know<00:03:04.920> not

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
spawn if light level is you know not

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.619 
spawn if light level is you know not
appropriate<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.609> them<00:03:06.849> so<00:03:07.090> they'll<00:03:07.239> still<00:03:07.599> be

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
appropriate to them so they'll still be

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.440 
appropriate to them so they'll still be
actually<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.230> day/night<00:03:08.739> cycle<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.400> while<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
actually a day/night cycle and while the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.330 
actually a day/night cycle and while the
nether<00:03:10.659> won't<00:03:11.109> really<00:03:11.349> care<00:03:11.470> about<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:11.920> in

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
nether won't really care about that in

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.080 
nether won't really care about that in
the<00:03:12.670> end<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.920> Enderman<00:03:15.400> will<00:03:15.549> only<00:03:15.670> spawn

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
the end the Enderman will only spawn

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.210 
the end the Enderman will only spawn
during<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.629> night<00:03:17.079> but<00:03:17.650> anyway<00:03:17.950> let's

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
during the night but anyway let's

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.430 
during the night but anyway let's
actually<00:03:18.370> use<00:03:18.669> the<00:03:18.880> end<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.810> show<00:03:20.290> it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
actually use the end just just show it

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.440 
actually use the end just just show it
to<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:21.730> use<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:21.910> zero<00:03:22.389> as<00:03:23.400> air

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
to you and we use that zero as air

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.659 
to you and we use that zero as air
alright<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:25.660> let's<00:03:25.840> have<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.500> as<00:03:26.950> done<00:03:27.370> and

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
alright so let's have that as done and

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.059 
alright so let's have that as done and
create<00:03:28.239> new<00:03:28.269> world<00:03:28.660> obviously<00:03:29.349> you<00:03:29.680> want<00:03:29.889> to

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
create new world obviously you want to

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.580 
create new world obviously you want to
start<00:03:30.400> jumping<00:03:31.329> right<00:03:31.629> off<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.049> moment<00:03:32.230> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
start jumping right off the moment and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.229 
start jumping right off the moment and
kind<00:03:32.889> of<00:03:32.980> start<00:03:33.250> floating<00:03:33.519> up<00:03:33.879> because

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
kind of start floating up because

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.940 
kind of start floating up because
otherwise<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:35.079> just<00:03:35.290> fall<00:03:35.560> into<00:03:35.739> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
otherwise you just fall into the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.550 
otherwise you just fall into the
darkness<00:03:36.220> let's<00:03:37.090> move<00:03:37.329> that<00:03:37.599> back<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.290> here

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
darkness let's move that back to here

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.039 
darkness let's move that back to here
and<00:03:38.799> as<00:03:39.129> you<00:03:39.160> can<00:03:39.370> see<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:40.060> sky<00:03:40.599> is<00:03:40.660> kind<00:03:40.930> of

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
and as you can see the sky is kind of

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.009 
and as you can see the sky is kind of
all<00:03:41.260> black<00:03:41.680> because<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.549> is<00:03:42.730> now<00:03:43.120> part<00:03:43.900> of

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
all black because this is now part of

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.229 
all black because this is now part of
the<00:03:44.290> end<00:03:44.500> but<00:03:44.949> there's<00:03:45.160> still<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.430> son<00:03:45.699> so

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
we're on a completely blank world but we

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.470 
we're on a completely blank world but we
want<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.799> block<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:54.340> start<00:03:54.639> boarding<00:03:54.849> farms<00:03:55.180> so

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
want to block to start boarding farms so

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.479 
want to block to start boarding farms so
let's<00:03:55.690> do<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.199> at<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.470> moment<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.310> want

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
let's do that at the moment so you want

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.650 
let's do that at the moment so you want
/<00:03:57.669> and<00:03:58.180> tape<00:03:58.480> out<00:03:58.720> set<00:03:59.680> block<00:04:00.370> command<00:04:00.819> just

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
/ and tape out set block command just

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.009 
/ and tape out set block command just
use<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.430> three<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.549> those<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:04.329> that'll<00:04:04.629> set<00:04:04.870> it

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
use the three of those so that'll set it

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.460 
use the three of those so that'll set it
right<00:04:05.349> where<00:04:05.709> we<00:04:05.889> are<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.340> we<00:04:06.730> use<00:04:07.230> block<00:04:08.230> as

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
right where we are and we use block as

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.789 
right where we are and we use block as
dirt<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:10.000> we<00:04:10.120> just<00:04:10.329> set<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.900> block<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.500> dirt

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
dirt so we just set a block of dirt

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.490 
dirt so we just set a block of dirt
right<00:04:12.250> here<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.730> there<00:04:13.660> we<00:04:13.750> go<00:04:13.780> it's<00:04:14.169> actually

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
right here and there we go it's actually

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.909 
right here and there we go it's actually
done<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:15.340> can<00:04:15.519> now<00:04:15.639> go<00:04:16.209> into<00:04:16.359> here<00:04:16.750> get<00:04:17.739> your

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
done you can now go into here get your

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.920 
done you can now go into here get your
iron<00:04:18.190> or<00:04:18.519> whatever<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.030> start<00:04:19.359> building<00:04:19.630> up

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
iron or whatever and start building up

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.220 
iron or whatever and start building up
whatever<00:04:20.500> design<00:04:21.360> suits<00:04:22.360> your<00:04:22.510> fancy<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.960> guess

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
whatever design suits your fancy I guess

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.260 
whatever design suits your fancy I guess
obviously<00:04:25.230> remember<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:26.160> wanted<00:04:26.610> to

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
obviously remember that if you wanted to

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.780 
obviously remember that if you wanted to
be<00:04:27.530> design<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.800> should<00:04:29.040> probably<00:04:29.400> set<00:04:29.639> the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
be design you should probably set the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.100 
be design you should probably set the
difficulty<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.419> peaceful<00:04:30.950> /<00:04:32.810> game<00:04:33.810> will<00:04:34.340> do

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
difficulty to peaceful / game will do

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.700 
difficulty to peaceful / game will do
what<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.260> dude<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.650> light<00:04:37.860> cycle<00:04:38.280> false<00:04:38.960> /<00:04:39.960> and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
what is a dude a light cycle false / and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.600 
what is a dude a light cycle false / and
lastly<00:04:41.550> /<00:04:41.910> time<00:04:42.270> set<00:04:42.780> for<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.410> thousand<00:04:43.950> which

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
lastly / time set for a thousand which

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.450 
lastly / time set for a thousand which
will<00:04:44.760> set<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.540> time<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.470> be<00:04:46.680> more<00:04:47.250> or<00:04:47.340> less

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
will set the time to be more or less

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.540 
will set the time to be more or less
like<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:48.150> know<00:04:48.270> noon<00:04:48.540> ish<00:04:49.139> or<00:04:49.410> something<00:04:49.830> so

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
it is perfect late condition that time

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.180 
it is perfect late condition that time
won't<00:04:53.790> pass<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:55.169> keep<00:04:55.590> building<00:04:55.800> and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
won't pass so you can keep building and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.400 
won't pass so you can keep building and
it'll<00:04:56.580> always<00:04:56.729> be<00:04:56.940> delayed<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.720> there<00:04:58.229> will
