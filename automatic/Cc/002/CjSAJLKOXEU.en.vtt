to 12 inches and that will be for the
tail<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.559> join<00:00:38.180> okay<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.809> are

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
tail where we join okay so now we are

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.139 
tail where we join okay so now we are
going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> show<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.649> could

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you do it for the width of the fabric so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.709 
you do it for the width of the fabric so
you're<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.820> quite<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> few<00:00:45.390> pieces

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
you're going to have quite a few pieces

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
you're going to have quite a few pieces
to<00:00:46.050> join<00:00:46.260> together<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.280> you'll<00:00:47.399> show<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> how

to join together so you'll show you how
to<00:00:47.969> join<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.670> get

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to join it and what you do is if you get

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.569 
to join it and what you do is if you get
the<00:00:51.420> pieces<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.140> place<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.190> sides

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the pieces and place them right sides

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.069 
the pieces and place them right sides
together<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.620> they're<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> right<00:00:56.610> angle

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
together and they're at a right angle

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.650 
together and they're at a right angle
then<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> need<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.489> from<00:01:00.329> this
