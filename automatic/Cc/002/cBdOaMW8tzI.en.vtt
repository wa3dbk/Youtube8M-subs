good to have you around so bad we've

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.269 
good to have you around so bad we've
talked<00:00:13.029> about<00:00:13.150> hardness<00:00:14.010> another<00:00:15.010> part<00:00:15.250> of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:15.279 
talked about hardness another part of

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.640 
talked about hardness another part of
the<00:00:15.400> process<00:00:15.580> is<00:00:16.029> tempering<00:00:16.720> why<00:00:17.380> don't<00:00:17.560> you

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
the process is tempering why don't you

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.620 
the process is tempering why don't you
tell<00:00:17.830> us<00:00:17.949> about<00:00:18.039> why<00:00:18.550> it's<00:00:18.939> important<00:00:19.570> to

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
tell us about why it's important to

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.470 
tell us about why it's important to
temper<00:00:19.870> your<00:00:19.900> butter<00:00:20.200> okay<00:00:21.100> that<00:00:22.090> tempering

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
temper your butter okay that tempering

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.570 
temper your butter okay that tempering
is<00:00:22.600> actually<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.350> final<00:00:23.830> step<00:00:24.100> in<00:00:24.370> the<00:00:24.430> heat

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
is actually the final step in the heat

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.920 
is actually the final step in the heat
treating<00:00:24.910> process<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:27.070> done<00:00:27.400> after<00:00:28.060> you<00:00:28.750> go

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
treating process it's done after you go

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.600 
treating process it's done after you go
through<00:00:28.960> your<00:00:29.320> initial<00:00:29.590> hardening<00:00:30.190> cycle

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610

your<00:00:30.789> quench<00:00:31.119> your<00:00:31.780> cryogenics<00:00:32.529> then<00:00:32.860> you<00:00:33.039> go

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
your quench your cryogenics then you go

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.970 
your quench your cryogenics then you go
into<00:00:33.340> what<00:00:33.489> we<00:00:33.610> call<00:00:33.789> tempering<00:00:34.769> tempering<00:00:35.769> is

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
into what we call tempering tempering is

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.049 
into what we call tempering tempering is
a<00:00:36.039> low<00:00:36.819> temperature<00:00:37.539> heat<00:00:38.069> process<00:00:39.069> it's

a low temperature heat process it's

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.250 
a low temperature heat process it's

during<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.899> hatred<00:00:56.289> process<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:57.039> what<00:00:57.460> that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:57.639 
during the hatred process and what that

during the hatred process and what that
tempering<00:00:58.149> does<00:00:58.389> when<00:00:59.049> you<00:00:59.289> get<00:00:59.739> done<00:00:59.949> with

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
tempering does when you get done with

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.250 
tempering does when you get done with
the<00:01:00.309> initial<00:01:00.879> hardening<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:01.569> a<00:01:01.629> cryogenic

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
process that steel is at its maximum

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.649 
process that steel is at its maximum
hardness<00:01:05.379> but<00:01:06.159> it's<00:01:06.460> almost<00:01:06.790> too<00:01:07.210> hard<00:01:07.450> at

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
hardness but it's almost too hard at

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.959 
hardness but it's almost too hard at
that<00:01:07.840> point<00:01:08.110> if<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.770> did<00:01:09.009> not<00:01:09.189> temper<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.789> and

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
that point if you did not temper it and

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.090 
that point if you did not temper it and
you<00:01:10.329> want<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.570> use<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.930> knife<00:01:11.200> it<00:01:11.680> might<00:01:11.920> hold

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
you want to use that knife it might hold

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.889 
you want to use that knife it might hold
a<00:01:12.219> great<00:01:12.399> edge<00:01:12.610> for<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.000> longest<00:01:13.360> time<00:01:13.570> but<00:01:13.600> if

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
a great edge for the longest time but if

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.120 
a great edge for the longest time but if
you<00:01:13.990> dropped<00:01:14.259> it<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.439> the<00:01:14.500> floor<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:15.009> could

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
you dropped it on the floor it could

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.550 
you dropped it on the floor it could
shatter<00:01:15.369> a<00:01:15.490> piece<00:01:15.759> it's<00:01:15.969> just<00:01:16.030> because

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
shatter a piece it's just because

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.249 
shatter a piece it's just because
without<00:01:17.560> tempering<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.640> steel<00:01:19.270> is<00:01:19.539> in<00:01:19.570> such<00:01:20.109> a

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
without tempering the steel is in such a

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.889 
without tempering the steel is in such a
brittle<00:01:20.649> state<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:22.270> would<00:01:22.450> be<00:01:22.570> easy<00:01:22.750> to

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
brittle state that it would be easy to

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.260 
brittle state that it would be easy to
chip<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.259> brick<00:01:23.619> so<00:01:24.340> what<00:01:24.520> we're<00:01:24.670> doing<00:01:24.700> is

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
chip a brick so what we're doing is

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.209 
chip a brick so what we're doing is
we're<00:01:25.479> just<00:01:25.509> taking<00:01:25.899> a<00:01:26.200> little<00:01:26.439> bit<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:27.039> that

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
we're just taking a little bit of that

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.480 
we're just taking a little bit of that
hardness<00:01:27.729> off<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.060> top<00:01:28.299> let's<00:01:28.869> say<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.590> just

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
hardness off the top let's say for just

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.359 
hardness off the top let's say for just
for<00:01:30.729> for<00:01:31.630> giggles<00:01:31.960> maybe<00:01:32.469> 10%<00:01:33.189> of<00:01:33.280> the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
for for giggles maybe 10% of the

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.969 
for for giggles maybe 10% of the
hardness<00:01:33.729> off<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.030> top<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:35.079> as<00:01:35.320> you<00:01:35.500> get<00:01:35.770> to

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
hardness off the top so as you get to

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.279 
hardness off the top so as you get to
full<00:01:36.250> hardness<00:01:36.729> then<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.420> temper<00:01:37.869> you're

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
full hardness then you temper you're

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.660 
full hardness then you temper you're
taking<00:01:38.560> just<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:38.770> little<00:01:38.979> bit<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.189> that<00:01:39.280> harness

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
taking just a little bit of that harness

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.520 
taking just a little bit of that harness
off<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.969> top<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:40.780> kick<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:40.990> hardness

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
off the top and you kick that hardness

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.389 
off the top and you kick that hardness
off<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.859> top<00:01:42.070> it<00:01:42.670> also<00:01:42.820> adds<00:01:43.890> toughness<00:01:44.890> so

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
off the top it also adds toughness so

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.880 
off the top it also adds toughness so
you're<00:01:45.549> always<00:01:45.759> trying<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.570> balance<00:01:47.259> with

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
you're always trying to balance with

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.010 
you're always trying to balance with
your<00:01:47.950> tempering<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.090> your<00:01:49.600> heat<00:01:49.780> treat

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
your tempering and your heat treat

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.319 
your tempering and your heat treat
process<00:01:50.499> in<00:01:50.710> total<00:01:51.249> but<00:01:51.429> in<00:01:51.700> tempering<00:01:52.210> you're

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
process in total but in tempering you're

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.020 
process in total but in tempering you're
always<00:01:52.450> trying<00:01:52.719> to<00:01:52.810> balance<00:01:53.049> that

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.749 

hardness<00:01:57.049> versus<00:01:58.049> toughness<00:01:58.560> okay

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
hardness versus toughness okay

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
hardness versus toughness okay
and<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.630> tempering<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.380> usually<00:02:01.530> get

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and with tempering you can usually get

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770 
and with tempering you can usually get
that<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> nice<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:03.000> balance<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.540> there

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that to a nice little balance in there

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.800 
that to a nice little balance in there
for<00:02:04.380> whatever<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:05.189> knife<00:02:05.630> application<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
for whatever your knife application is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.710 
for whatever your knife application is
if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> need<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:08.069> more

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
if you need a little bit more

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.270 
if you need a little bit more
wearability<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.140> want<00:02:10.679> your<00:02:10.830> knife<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.130> be<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
wearability you want your knife to be a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.979 
wearability you want your knife to be a
little<00:02:11.610> bit<00:02:11.730> harder<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.630> don't<00:02:12.840> want

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
little bit harder because you don't want

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.600 
little bit harder because you don't want
to<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.230> sharpen<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.680> as<00:02:13.800> often<00:02:14.160> you're

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
to have to sharpen it as often you're

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.070 
to have to sharpen it as often you're
gonna<00:02:14.730> want<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.000> temper<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.660> little<00:02:15.930> bit

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
gonna want to temper just a little bit

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.449 
gonna want to temper just a little bit
less<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.709> say<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> little<00:02:17.040> bit<00:02:17.250> less

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
less and when I say a little bit less

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.250 
less and when I say a little bit less
usually<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.060> means<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.989> lower

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
usually that means just a lower

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.160 
usually that means just a lower
temperature<00:02:19.769> okay<00:02:20.550> if<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
temperature okay if you want to in the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.229 
temperature okay if you want to in the
case<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.130> know<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.370> found<00:02:23.640> out<00:02:23.819> with<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
case of you know we found out with the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.420 
case of you know we found out with the
with<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.050> Pathfinder<00:02:25.620> knife<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.069> scandi

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
with the Pathfinder knife and a scandi

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.940 
with the Pathfinder knife and a scandi
dry<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:27.630> were<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:28.049> bit<00:02:28.200> hard<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.799> those

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
dry we were a little bit hard on those

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.949 
dry we were a little bit hard on those
initial<00:02:29.519> things<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.420> were<00:02:30.510> getting<00:02:30.660> some

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
initial things and you were getting some

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.180 
initial things and you were getting some
chipping<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.769> at<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.040> point<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.459> added<00:02:33.140> we

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
chipping so at that point we added we

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.170 
chipping so at that point we added we
increased<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> temporary<00:02:35.760> temperature<00:02:36.150> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
increased the temporary temperature a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.440 
increased the temporary temperature a
little<00:02:36.330> bit<00:02:36.480> by<00:02:36.890> 150<00:02:37.890> degrees<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:39.239> took

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
little bit by 150 degrees and that took

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.240 
little bit by 150 degrees and that took
a<00:02:39.510> little<00:02:39.780> bit<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.989> hardness<00:02:40.319> off<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.709> top<00:02:40.920> and

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
a little bit of hardness off the top and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.490 
a little bit of hardness off the top and
added<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.180> toughness<00:02:42.720> you're<00:02:42.959> looking<00:02:43.230> for

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
added that toughness you're looking for

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.490 
added that toughness you're looking for
so<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.580> tempering<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.930> heating

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
so the tempering is just a heating

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.330 
so the tempering is just a heating
process<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.850> used<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.660> adjust<00:02:49.650> your

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
process that is used to adjust your

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.300 
process that is used to adjust your
final<00:02:50.790> hardness<00:02:51.209> now<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.650> number<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.040> tempers

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
final hardness now the number of tempers

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
final hardness now the number of tempers
you<00:02:53.430> mentioned<00:02:53.760> earlier<00:02:54.090> anything<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.959> cry

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
you mentioned earlier anything you cry

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
you mentioned earlier anything you cry
over<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.530> generally<00:02:55.860> double<00:02:56.220> temper<00:02:56.519> is

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
over you generally double temper is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.509 
over you generally double temper is
there<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.870> rule<00:02:58.769> at<00:02:59.180> 3/4<00:03:00.180> tempers<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.930> mean

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
there a rule at 3/4 tempers I mean

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.860 
there a rule at 3/4 tempers I mean
you're<00:03:02.519> what<00:03:02.790> you're<00:03:02.880> actually<00:03:03.090> trying<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.570> do

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
you're what you're actually trying to do

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.830 
you're what you're actually trying to do
and<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.859> I'm<00:03:05.700> gonna<00:03:05.880> jumped<00:03:06.209> up<00:03:06.299> into<00:03:06.570> some

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and and I'm gonna jumped up into some

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840 
and and I'm gonna jumped up into some
some<00:03:07.290> heat-treat<00:03:07.980> words<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.549> you're

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
some heat-treat words here you're

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.410 
some heat-treat words here you're
actually<00:03:09.299> trying<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:10.459> get<00:03:11.459> rid<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.790> what<00:03:12.299> they

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
actually trying to get rid of what they

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.630 
actually trying to get rid of what they
call<00:03:12.630> retained<00:03:13.109> austenite<00:03:13.440> which<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.459> an

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
call retained austenite which is an

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.690 
call retained austenite which is an
undesirable<00:03:15.650> grain<00:03:16.650> structure<00:03:17.220> formation

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
undesirable grain structure formation

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.819 
undesirable grain structure formation
that<00:03:18.510> happens<00:03:18.930> during<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> heating<00:03:19.650> process

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
that happens during the heating process

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.000 
that happens during the heating process
so<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.390> cryogenic<00:03:22.019> process<00:03:22.200> help<00:03:22.709> get

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
so the the cryogenic process help get

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.650 
so the the cryogenic process help get
rid<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.370> retained<00:03:23.730> austenite<00:03:23.910> you're

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
rid of that retained austenite you're

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.259 
rid of that retained austenite you're
actually<00:03:24.989> cheating<00:03:25.380> changing<00:03:25.890> that

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
actually cheating changing that

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.460 
actually cheating changing that
austenite<00:03:27.269> which<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.690> an<00:03:27.810> arranged<00:03:28.049> structure

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
austenite which is an arranged structure

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.849 
austenite which is an arranged structure
in<00:03:28.620> steel<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:29.430> what<00:03:29.579> they<00:03:29.700> call<00:03:29.880> martensite

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
in steel to what they call martensite

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.170 
in steel to what they call martensite
Austinites<00:03:31.859> bed<00:03:32.600> martensite<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.660> good<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:34.799> the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
Austinites bed martensite is good so the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.910 
Austinites bed martensite is good so the
cryogenic<00:03:36.180> process<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.470> tempering

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
cryogenic process and the tempering

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.059 
cryogenic process and the tempering
processes<00:03:38.609> will<00:03:39.299> reduce<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.350> retained

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
processes will reduce that retained

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.290 
processes will reduce that retained
austenite<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.910> change<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.720> into

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
austenite and change it into

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.680 
austenite and change it into
tempered<00:03:43.690> martensite<00:03:45.210> that<00:03:46.210> being<00:03:46.480> said

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
tempered martensite that being said

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.030 
tempered martensite that being said
that's<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.110> green<00:03:47.320> structure<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.920> we

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
that's that green structure that we

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.400 
that's that green structure that we
talked<00:03:48.280> about<00:03:48.430> earlier<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.870> far<00:03:50.050> as<00:03:50.170> what<00:03:50.290> the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
talked about earlier as far as what the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.860 
talked about earlier as far as what the
cryogenics<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.220> goes<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:52.390> what<00:03:52.600> is<00:03:52.720> the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
cryogenics and that goes but what is the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.200 
cryogenics and that goes but what is the
the<00:03:53.260> reason<00:03:53.620> for<00:03:53.800> doing<00:03:54.220> multiple<00:03:54.700> tempers<00:03:55.060> on

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
the reason for doing multiple tempers on

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.810 
the reason for doing multiple tempers on
on<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.690> knife<00:03:55.870> okay

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820
