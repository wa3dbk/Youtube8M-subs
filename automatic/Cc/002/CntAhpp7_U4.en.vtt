00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
like it I didn't think it was gonna be

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.090 
like it I didn't think it was gonna be
that<00:02:26.520> good<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.570> must<00:02:28.020> say<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.920> is

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
cream I was trying to do like a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.100

strawberry or cherry type of ice cream

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.430 
strawberry or cherry type of ice cream
and<00:02:40.110> over<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:42.390> my<00:02:42.420> Hello<00:02:42.900> Kitty's

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and over here I have my Hello Kitty's

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.520 
and over here I have my Hello Kitty's
but<00:02:43.680> as<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.400> see<00:02:44.610> they<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.840> can<00:02:46.230> see

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
but as you can see they if you can see

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.940 
but as you can see they if you can see
it<00:02:46.830> has<00:02:47.040> kind<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.430> some<00:02:47.700> bubbles<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.239> it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
it has kind of like some bubbles in it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.820 
it has kind of like some bubbles in it
because<00:02:49.950> while<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.489> pouring<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:52.530> was

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
because while I was pouring it it was

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.680 
because while I was pouring it it was
sitting<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.400> real<00:02:53.670> fast<00:02:53.850> maybe<00:02:54.209> because<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.570> was

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
sitting up real fast maybe because I was

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.009 
sitting up real fast maybe because I was
near<00:02:54.989> my<00:02:55.140> dryer<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.390> guess<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.570> heat<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
near my dryer and I guess the heat and

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.500 
near my dryer and I guess the heat and
everything<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.920> so<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:01.739> cured<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.880> was<00:03:03.030> curing

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
everything and so it cured it was curing

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.780 
everything and so it cured it was curing
it<00:03:03.630> was<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.900> process<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.350> curing<00:03:04.790> faster

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
it was in the process of curing faster

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.430 
it was in the process of curing faster
than<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.090> was<00:03:06.269> expecting<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.140> because

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
than I was expecting it to because

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.120 
than I was expecting it to because
usually<00:03:07.799> don't<00:03:07.980> cure<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.519> fast<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.150> anyway

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
usually don't cure that fast but anyway

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.490 
usually don't cure that fast but anyway
this<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.400> I'm<00:03:11.820> really<00:03:12.420> really<00:03:12.600> liking<00:03:13.110> this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
this is I'm really really liking this

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.509 
this is I'm really really liking this
tempera<00:03:14.100> paints<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.870> must<00:03:16.830> see<00:03:17.040> how<00:03:17.280> they

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
tempera paints so I must see how they

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.120 
tempera paints so I must see how they
turn<00:03:17.790> out<00:03:17.820> once<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.510> put<00:03:18.959> my<00:03:19.230> other<00:03:19.530> finishing

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
turn out once I put my other finishing

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.039 
turn out once I put my other finishing
layers<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.239> white<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.570> didn't

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
layers on it and now the white I didn't

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.720 
layers on it and now the white I didn't

get the tempera paint in it that was
just<00:03:26.790> plain<00:03:27.980> white<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:30.209> simple<00:03:30.840> simply<00:03:31.680> our

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
just plain white is it simple simply our

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.960 
just plain white is it simple simply our
acrylic<00:03:33.060> paint<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.980> must<00:03:35.400> say<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.790> did

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970

turn it white I really like this and I

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.740 
turn it white I really like this and I
might<00:03:38.340> just<00:03:38.579> go<00:03:38.700> ahead<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.180> start<00:03:39.390> getting<00:03:39.450> me

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
might just go ahead and start getting me

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.280 
might just go ahead and start getting me
some<00:03:39.959> sets<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.440> start<00:03:41.430> getting<00:03:41.640> me<00:03:41.760> some

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
some sets of start getting me some

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.940 
some sets of start getting me some
different<00:03:43.290> kinds<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.829> acrylic<00:03:44.400> paint

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
different kinds of acrylic paint

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.070 
different kinds of acrylic paint
this<00:03:46.190> white<00:03:46.460> is<00:03:46.700> really<00:03:47.180> really<00:03:47.390> white<00:03:47.630> as<00:03:47.900> you

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
this white is really really white as you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.510 
this white is really really white as you
can<00:03:48.260> see<00:03:48.520> it's<00:03:49.520> really<00:03:50.770> it's<00:03:51.770> really<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
can see it's really it's really the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.930 
can see it's really it's really the
bubbles<00:03:53.240> in<00:03:53.360> this<00:03:53.600> is<00:03:53.840> because<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.200> use<00:03:54.470> flakes

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
bubbles in this is because I use flakes

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.490 
bubbles in this is because I use flakes
so<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> flakes<00:03:56.330> are<00:03:56.510> starting<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.840> peak<00:03:57.020> out<00:03:57.170> a

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
so the flakes are starting to peak out a

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.190 
so the flakes are starting to peak out a
little<00:03:57.800> bit<00:03:58.210> that's<00:03:59.210> why<00:03:59.450> they're<00:03:59.690> like<00:03:59.930> that

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
little bit that's why they're like that

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.740 
little bit that's why they're like that
but<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:01.070> simple<00:04:01.460> paint<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:02.030> really<00:04:02.570> really

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
but this simple paint is really really

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.600 
but this simple paint is really really
good<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.590> might<00:04:03.830> just<00:04:04.100> go<00:04:04.190> ahead<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.550> get

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
good and I might just go ahead and get

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.530 
good and I might just go ahead and get
the<00:04:04.760> rest<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.120> colors<00:04:05.450> in<00:04:05.600> Walmart<00:04:07.540> water
