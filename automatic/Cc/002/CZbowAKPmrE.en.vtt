 football quiz with new ones today 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.030
 commentary today is day 9 of mine 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.540
 count down the new series to call of duty 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.130
 ghosts 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.110
 today i'm talking about you 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.689
 the shopkins and that is actually one 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.970
 subject where i got it i had it today 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.859
 want to go over with you because me 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.999
 so today with the partial in mp3 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.009
 played 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.240
 I had seen the modal and 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.550
 and dimi of mine who was him 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.720
 and I thought of that I want 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.489
 actually quite use it 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.100
 so I pretty much all day with one 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.150
 fashion walk shoot and it ordered it 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.470
 moon or it pleased 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.230
 but very well i really thought it was one 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.240
 nice thing and with it actually brought 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.460
 a few questions with me upstairs and the 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.350
 most important of these was how will the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.330
 schruns in call of duty ghosts well 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.860
 work exactly 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.300
 the first question is the biggest question 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.490
 actually already answered a bit 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.990
 everyone of course at the beginning 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.640
 the question they will again just as in 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.010
 engine for two will be sister 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.540
 secondary or will they be just like one 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.890
 engine sadness and actually a bit 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.570
 just the rest of the call or duty's 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.160
 primaries 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.140
 I played her along on call of duty 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.609
 ghosts on job on firstlook I have 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.590
 just played call of duty ghosts and me 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.450
 can confirm you 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.119
 I'm pretty sure they are primary 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.649
 I do n't know for 120 percent but 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.929
 I looked at all the secondaries that we 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.479
 could play and there stood there 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.890
 stood so god are not among the that 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.659
 is new from good news for none 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.119
 you don't think children's like 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.890
 Secondaries have to because they then 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.689
 would be overpowerd or something 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.399
 at least you have two shot art 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.549
 who are sure it is really very bad 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.869
 little it is it is different 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.670
 most call or duty you have a piece or 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.030
 four five six I can imagine that 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.859
 you in and with two you have I believe 4 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.139
 and actually that is also a bit the 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.209
 usually name something strange as a shell 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.429
 if you have shopkins as the primary weapon 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.200
 you a lot more than always when you then 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.670
 what if god can be secondary I 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.189
 mean as with all are they have in and 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.920
 bring two three or four shopkins and have 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.709
 they have a mp3 some six or seven 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.299
 because it is in mp3 primer that 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.829
 this is really just too 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.840
 explain it because they have some in the morning 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.369
 hold back for us I would not know 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.979
 why do this but maybe also one 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.179
 little bit to the secret big 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.170
 to hold 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.670
 I believe there are some him 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.959
 rumors broke out 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.490
 of what is after but those are real 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.959
 neighbors rumor and when one 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.940
 little support is therefore 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.860
 then I will not pass it on to you either 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.420
 at least have the today 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.920
 two types of art that are well known 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 to be 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.270
 its pretty different i do it 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.100
 can will best can say you have that 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.840
 misses a few shop art anyway 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.190
 You always get standard hijabs from you 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.069
 for example always a standard pump 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.270
 action shunde think so only 12 think 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.400
 to the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.739
 know that thing in blackops second ksg 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.540
 I believe so healthy art you have here 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.630
 not yet so they still have to arrive 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.680
 and i go i think i still know me 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.269
 I think I will expect that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.569
 and the two debt chance we have now 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.060
 is actually a bit one by one 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.060
 kind of counterpart of the a12 and the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.040
 and in 1216 from a12 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.319
 from motor grief and mono marver two 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 and the and 1216 from backups two 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.230
 of course 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.880
 it actually basically means that 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.560
 who shoots very quickly and you like him too 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.840
 can reload fairly quickly and that it 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.950
 basically a shot and is 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.840
 which is meant to attract many many people 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.970
 to be able to go down a very short distance 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.640
 and each a very short time so were you allowed 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.019
 you could sit in a very small house 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.609
 walk in there and you know there 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.440
 a lot and the misses to go with it 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.209
 I'd do it myself 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.340
 the I would think I'll be able to do this 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.660
 may choose 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.459
 it has a weird name it is not 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.230
 number that sit most most 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.930
 points have a figure they think again 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.450
 so adjust 12 a12 and it is a coincidence 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.190
 and most people have the most 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.750
 shield us have a 12 you in the number 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.579
 but that is that it has something too 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.920
 with the caliber I can still have a 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.540
 sometime have to pass but not in 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.489
 so this case has no number 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.650
 her is just called the mold and that she is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.090
 write as mhl 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.769
 so if you pronounce tops dutch 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.319
 actually describes times and times 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.220
 It is there that is also clear for that 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.470
 you 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.510
 that is a bit like the a12-like shop 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.069
 I can seriously hope that they will 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.019
 anything normal shop can be that one 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.870
 bit scared exin are going back there 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.519
 because I know I see personally 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.130
 she cannot get sick between these two shots 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.959
 really a shot-gun that I like myself 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.169
 really appeals 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.630
 then you have the mts 255 you can 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.320
 actually comparing a bit with the 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.760
 ksg only then is the cheese ships pack 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.530
 are so that you say to every shot 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 must reload and the mts 255 is a name 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.450
 is a bit of an iframe shot-gun 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.860
 I think he just says that 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.900
 but one behind the other can shoot so 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.240
 bit like one and 1014 in mono marver 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.770
 two for the ones that for those 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.790
 whoever does not possess that may know 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.160
 to remind 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.600
 He is not very happy 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.760
 fast he just shoots a bit like 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.890
 I can tell you a 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.060
 boom boom boom boom boom instead of 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.430
 boom boom boom boom boom like the mold 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.320
 does not do very quickly but he has 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.510
 a lot further range and that is 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.010
 nice that is the new fall 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.810
 at least something good will be 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.490
 buns for those who do not know shop 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.080
 You can generally be one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.420
 bit the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.950
 the weapons where a property it 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.820
 most important and that is the distance 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.620
 true 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.230
 where are people can one shot one 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.910
 kill him and if you got it right then 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.380
 actually the shot-gun as standard throughout 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.510
 very good unless you really have a whole 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.460
 slow and fire red as for example 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.420
 then I get the mon again for that 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.400
 I mentioned before 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.040
 the moodle has the farthest range in mono 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.690
 for which 3 only he has just 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.110
 don't eat such a quick fire and that's why 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.220
 so many people only choose 12 or the ksg 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.500
 above the mole 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.970
 but since today I no longer have it 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.740
 today with the mothers want to be wilske 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.690
 and it was really a wonderful weapon 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.580
 to play with and I even had it 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.500
 no bridge and no damage on the star 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.760
 completely finished 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.360
 all in all, life starts to think 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.380
 about what kind of bizarre 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.240
 playing style I must have wanted 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.410
 I still liked that thing 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.260
 but yeah 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.540
 So mts skew five and five things and she 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.250
 may be is a little revolver behind 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.770
 i think this can compare so best 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.830
 revolver is also a dingle stand 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.120
 pyton the python and after the point for the 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.860
 for magnum 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.900
 it actually takes a long time to reload 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.870
 so the complete counterpart of the mold 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.150
 it could reload very quickly and the only one 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.860
 what they are a bit a bit the same 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.020
 is that they can go fairly quickly 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.460
 shoot of course the mold will be a lot 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.180
 shoot faster but they can still 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.740
 both 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.260
 shoot relatively fast if you get it 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.250
 compares with the after a pan actions of 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.390
 to do 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.849
 i hope you enjoyed it i 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.139
 hope you guys 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.119
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.830
 hope you yourself also look forward to call 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:39.499
 or duty ghosts I personally cannot 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.149
 waiting for November 5th and I hope so 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.679
 I also do a bit with this series 

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:44.809
 get that far that you can't either 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:46.309
 at least wait if you like him
