00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 good to everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.200
 learn how to install xperia extreme b3 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.990
 in the samsung galaxy pocket this round 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.389
 is very similar to the roms of xperia and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.030
 he sees his name and as always is a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.100
 very simple process that is equal to the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 installation of several rounds as 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.730
 we always have to have a file 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.730
 located on the memory card which 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.869
 Let's see 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.180
 is this xperia extreme of three points and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.930
 we see the memory card we are going to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.930
 pay our cell phone 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.740
 for this process we are going to need 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.930
 our cell phone rooted and with which 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.190
 installed recovery mode is also going to 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.780
 lose all our data since 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.160
 we will have to do a factory reset 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.170
 therefore it is advisable if not 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.770
 you want to lose your data have a backup 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.770
 Already done 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.579
 you know the cell phone off we go to 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.199
 enter into recovery mode by pressing 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.980
 volume key we risk home button 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 + power button 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.030
 let go of the power 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.030
 and it is already 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.070
 recovery center let's go to the fourth 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.560
 option that is datafactory reset 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.790
 we select with this and we go down with 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.520
 this 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.009
 how is it 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.079
 and with the factor that ceiling finally I 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.810
 will comment on the rom 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:33.579
 the second option and then the first and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.579
 then we look for the file 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.730
 Extreme xperia as you see and we give 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.290
 select we look for the option yes and the 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.570
 you start installing cellular Roma 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.100
 when the rom have been installed let's 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.770
 go back and let's choose the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.190
 option rebut system we will find the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.190
 yes option 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.700
 and the cell is going to restart as 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.350
 always after installation and a branch 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.789
 the first restart will take a little longer 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.700
 but the rest of the restarts are going to be 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.500
 completely normal when our 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.619
 cellular or it has been restarted I choose the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.619
 language 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.870
 and it is already finished and we have our 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.110
 rom installed as we can see the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.230
 interface is very similar 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.870
 the one of the xperia because of that what 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.760
 this rum is based 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.079
 as we can find here 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.819
 about the device as seen here 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:47.590
 xperia extreme of 3 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.019
 since we have that we have version of the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.790
 4.4 as always here this in the version 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.599
 of android 4.4 if it is not a version of 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.330
 4.0 tuned as seen here we have all 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.280
 the characteristics of 4.4 however 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.810
 it's not good I hope that this 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.940
 tutorials is served and if they have 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.379
 Any doubt or concern do not hesitate 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.150

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.150
