good<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.010> they<00:00:26.130> break<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.580> classes<00:00:27.000> down

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150

like<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.140> two

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
like that that you can have two

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.230 
like that that you can have two
different<00:00:28.470> classes<00:00:28.920> within<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.640> original

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
different classes within your original

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.530 
different classes within your original
setting<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> mage<00:00:31.520> also<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.759> an<00:00:32.940> enhancer

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
