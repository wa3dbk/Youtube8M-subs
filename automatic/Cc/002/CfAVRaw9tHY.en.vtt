00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.950
 welcome to the victorious strike of need 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.410
 Today there is a light gate bridge 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.180
 for the patch 1.1 4 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.529
 I already have a patch notes already 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.350
 unfortunately, it is so that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 rockstar the salary of 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.140
 supercars with such glitches 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.830
 that is, who does it here? 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.310
 only about 150,000 per sale 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.230
 dollar 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.270
 but you do not need that much either 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.670
 time for the glitch a maximum of one to two 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 I've always needed millions for that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 whether there will be glitches again in the future 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 in which one for his supercar the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 We have to get the full price 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 look first now shows like this one 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.329
 does that work with the best of the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.129
 Right now, it's about the trick 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.050
 to perform first with you 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.460
 a buddy in your garage and go 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.809
 then on this blue circle around the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.149
 sequence of vehicles in yours 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.710
 garage to change for the vehicle 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.500
 with the hat trick from the volt must 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 where my mentor net is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.909
 in the back right in your garage that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.680
 vehicle with the trick performs 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.659
 make you in and your buddy now 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.119
 the passenger door opens and runs ortega 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.830
 At the moment against, you are distracting 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 with the vehicles slightly to the right with 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.100
 luckily, the whole thing works 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 right with a bit of bad luck needed for that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.150
 a little longer time the vehicle must on 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 end as it stands now 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.110
 the right front full light must be connected to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 be tuned to this black bar and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.159
 the passenger door over this blue 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.210
 circle now you go into the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.280
 passenger door on and while 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.049
 pressed on the d-pad to the right in the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 to sit and while in the vehicle 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.860
 this menu to be in here 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.420
 now swaps the place of samp tornos 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 or from the vehicle to the drive 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.229
 do that with another vehicle 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.299
 no longer needs like a karl 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.040
 may then press to b or circle 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.020
 Thereafter, consoles drive with the vehicle 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.020
 where you are sitting right in yours 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.520
 garage out some are that you can be 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.619
 sell your vehicle directly now 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.810
 I would not recommend that because 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.909
 then I only have 1300 dollars film 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.920
 a vehicle received therefore meant 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.229
 turn around again with your vehicle and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.240
 Now back to your garage 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.770
 You do not have much to do there either 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.629
 just do it again 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 get in the car again 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.360
 found out garage and now you go 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.160
 you to the nearest 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.800
 ls customs at the tuning workshop 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.450

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.880
 inside and inside you can drive the vehicle 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.340
 Now I'm getting for mainz 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.080
 but about 70,000 dollars was also to 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.480
 Part of the fact that the vehicle is not full 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 was filled up and you your centro 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.680

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.390
 Get $ 110,000 or so and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.210
 makes her with NEM occurred VokatÃ½ 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.980
 because you will receive your 150000 there 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.080
 dollar is not as much as at 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.730
 the old money glitches but think it 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.200
 I already a very nice amount who 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.030
 this can definitely be a money- saver 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.620
 and we just have to hope 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.600
 that it will be money again in the near future 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.570

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.100
 You get $ 650,000 you can see 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.900
