00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
for you to actually comment about the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.290 
for you to actually comment about the
great<00:00:22.050> design<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.680> hp20<00:00:23.519> thank<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:24.060> much

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
great design of hp20 thank you very much

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.230 
great design of hp20 thank you very much
and<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.010> question<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> size

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and as for your question about the size

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.990 
and as for your question about the size
of<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.980> designers<00:00:29.400> call<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
of what we at with designers call a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.510 
of what we at with designers call a
tailgate<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.230> backlight<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:33.530> actual<00:00:34.530> size<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
tailgate a backlight the actual size of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
tailgate a backlight the actual size of
the<00:00:36.450> backlight<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.309> determined<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:39.450> design

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the backlight is determined as in design

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.430 
the backlight is determined as in design
what<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.829> call<00:00:41.100> by<00:00:41.370> proportions<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
what we call by proportions and as you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.410 
what we call by proportions and as you
can<00:00:43.620> see<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:44.040> course<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.700> backlight<00:00:45.149> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
can see of course the backlight is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
can see of course the backlight is
slightly<00:00:45.780> smaller<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.890> class<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
slightly smaller so the other class you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.420 
slightly smaller so the other class you
might<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.930> actually<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
might see but when you actually see the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.660 
might see but when you actually see the
line<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.440> call<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.649> body<00:00:53.010> side<00:00:53.340> line

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
line the what we call a body side line

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760 
line the what we call a body side line
running<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.870> way<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> front<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
running all the way from the front to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
running all the way from the front to
the<00:00:55.920> rear<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.750> gradually<00:00:57.750> rising<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> the

the rear and gradually rising to the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.920 
the rear and gradually rising to the
back<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.609> where<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> belt<00:01:00.870> line

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
back you can see where the belt line

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560 
back you can see where the belt line
ends<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:03.120> imagined

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
ends you can actually see an imagined

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.490 
ends you can actually see an imagined
imaginary<00:01:04.409> line<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.799> runs<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
imaginary line that runs all the way to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
imaginary line that runs all the way to
this<00:01:07.500> edge<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.430> backlight<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.479> what

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this edge of the backlight so what

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.490 
this edge of the backlight so what
happens<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.340> overall<00:01:11.670> design<00:01:12.500> actually

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
happens is the overall design actually

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.580 
happens is the overall design actually
determines<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.210> rising<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.020> Beltline

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
determines the rising of the Beltline

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.249 
determines the rising of the Beltline
the<00:01:17.130> body<00:01:17.369> side<00:01:17.610> character<00:01:18.240> what<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.990> call

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the body side character what we call

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.719 
the body side character what we call
side<00:01:19.830> window<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.700> call<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.530> DL<00:01:22.530> load<00:01:22.770> will

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
side window we call it the DL load will

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
side window we call it the DL load will
determine<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> size<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.560> backlight

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
determine the size of the the backlight

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.359 
determine the size of the the backlight
and<00:01:26.299> because<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> overall<00:01:27.869> design<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> hb20

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and because the overall design of hb20

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.990 
and because the overall design of hb20
is<00:01:29.670> very<00:01:29.939> sporting<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:31.200> dynamic<00:01:31.790> there<00:01:32.790> has

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
is very sporting very dynamic there has

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
is very sporting very dynamic there has
been<00:01:33.240> some<00:01:33.600> compromise<00:01:34.200> yes<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.710> true

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
been some compromise yes it's true

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
been some compromise yes it's true
there's<00:01:35.549> been<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.030> compromise<00:01:36.600> with<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
there's been some compromise with the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.399 
there's been some compromise with the
reduction<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> tape<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.630> should<00:01:40.259> say

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
reduction of the tape the I should say

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.969 
reduction of the tape the I should say
the<00:01:40.560> backlight<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.390> believe<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.590> overall

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the backlight but we believe the overall

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.370 
the backlight but we believe the overall
styling<00:01:46.070> would<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.280> good<00:01:47.460> enough<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.869> did

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
styling would be good enough that we did

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.460 
styling would be good enough that we did
make<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> very<00:01:50.159> small<00:01:50.729> compromise<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
make a very small compromise with the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
make a very small compromise with the
size<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> backlight<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.970> thank<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> for

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
size of the backlight so thank you for

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.649 
size of the backlight so thank you for
your<00:01:54.540> question<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> very<00:01:56.250> very

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
your question and that was a very very

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.440 
your question and that was a very very
what<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> call<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.500> intuitive<00:01:59.450> question

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
what you call a very intuitive question

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
what you call a very intuitive question
that<00:02:00.630> you've<00:02:00.750> made<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.590> thank<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.009> your

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that you've made so thank you for your
