there<00:02:00.860> there's<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> few<00:02:02.219> guys<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.729> hear<00:02:02.880> on

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
there there's a few guys I can hear on

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.190 
there there's a few guys I can hear on
the<00:02:03.030> other<00:02:03.210> side<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.450> these<00:02:03.689> crates<00:02:03.990> here

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the other side of these crates here

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.100 
the other side of these crates here
let's<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> take<00:02:05.310> my<00:02:05.520> surprise<00:02:06.110> note

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
let's see if I can take my surprise note

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.609 
let's see if I can take my surprise note
that<00:02:07.140> already<00:02:07.560> down<00:02:08.179> sorry<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:10.440> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
that already down sorry I think this is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.380 
that already down sorry I think this is
taut<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.979> gonna<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.250> flank<00:02:11.580> around<00:02:12.120> behind

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
taut of gonna be a flank around behind

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.580 
taut of gonna be a flank around behind
the<00:02:12.540> enemy<00:02:12.750> team

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the enemy team

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.110 
the enemy team
and<00:02:13.709> if<00:02:13.800> we<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.099> get<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> nice<00:02:14.640> little<00:02:14.849> bit<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and if we can get a nice little bit of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.880 
and if we can get a nice little bit of
accuracy<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.629> that<00:02:15.900> we're<00:02:16.680> gonna<00:02:16.800> be

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
accuracy like that we're gonna be

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.280 
accuracy like that we're gonna be
picking<00:02:17.069> up<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.370> decent<00:02:17.700> amount<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.910> kills

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
picking up a decent amount of kills

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.509 
picking up a decent amount of kills
again<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.470> High<00:02:19.680> Point<00:02:19.709> here<00:02:20.220> should<00:02:20.430> be

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
again this High Point here should be

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.110 
again this High Point here should be
quite<00:02:20.730> good

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
quite good

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.500 
quite good
I'm<00:02:21.209> just<00:02:21.720> generally<00:02:22.760> not<00:02:23.760> getting<00:02:24.120> anywhere

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
I'm just generally not getting anywhere

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.930 
I'm just generally not getting anywhere
near<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.019> middle<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.190> map<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.580> stick<00:02:26.819> to

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
near the middle of the map just stick to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.400 
near the middle of the map just stick to
the<00:02:27.030> outskirts<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.190> go<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:30.410> think

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the outskirts it's the way to go I think

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.050 
the outskirts it's the way to go I think
I'm<00:02:31.920> gonna<00:02:32.040> end<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.459> trouble<00:02:32.760> here<00:02:32.940> though

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
I'm gonna end up in trouble here though

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.690 
I'm gonna end up in trouble here though
I<00:02:33.090> can't<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.720> where<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:33.959> guy<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.700> know

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
I can't see where this guy is I know

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.539 
I can't see where this guy is I know
he's<00:02:35.940> around<00:02:36.060> here<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.940> was<00:02:39.090> poor<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:41.099> got

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
he's around here that was poor so I got

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.490 
he's around here that was poor so I got
him<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.879> end<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.629> first<00:02:42.900> two<00:02:43.049> shots<00:02:43.319> were

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
him in the end the first two shots were

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.460 
him in the end the first two shots were
a<00:02:43.530> little<00:02:43.650> off<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:45.000> trying<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.390> kind<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.200> drag

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
a little off just trying to kind of drag

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.710 
a little off just trying to kind of drag
scope<00:02:46.799> at<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.099> close<00:02:47.430> range<00:02:47.510> not<00:02:48.510> good<00:02:48.690> I

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
scope at that close range not good I

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.970 
scope at that close range not good I
think<00:02:48.870> they're<00:02:49.170> gonna<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.380> probably<00:02:49.709> working

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
think they're gonna be probably working

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.190 
think they're gonna be probably working
their<00:02:50.220> way<00:02:50.250> around<00:02:50.640> from<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.630> Bourne

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
their way around from this Bourne

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.220 
their way around from this Bourne
there's<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.860> nice<00:02:53.040> little<00:02:53.069> gap<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:54.230> fence

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
there's a nice little gap in this fence

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.470 
there's a nice little gap in this fence
but<00:02:55.680> where<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.459> lightning<00:02:56.790> was<00:02:56.880> bright<00:02:57.150> I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
but where that lightning was bright I

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.150 
but where that lightning was bright I
don't<00:02:58.140> really<00:02:58.290> know<00:02:58.440> where<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.739> go<00:02:58.860> there<00:02:59.069> a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
don't really know where to go there a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.319 
don't really know where to go there a
lot<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.370> them<00:02:59.489> were<00:02:59.610> kind<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.879> really<00:03:00.120> far<00:03:00.299> down

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
lot of them were kind of really far down

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.140 
lot of them were kind of really far down

work their way around you know what they
must<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.769> sticking<00:03:14.129> at<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> bottom<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.549> the

here<00:03:17.489> probably<00:03:17.760> very<00:03:18.150> over<00:03:18.709> enemy<00:03:19.709> snipers

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220

fairly<00:03:38.459> similar<00:03:38.849> in<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> way<00:03:39.329> it's<00:03:39.630> used<00:03:40.019> so

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
fairly similar in the way it's used so

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.250 
fairly similar in the way it's used so
I'm<00:03:42.030> actually<00:03:42.209> gonna<00:03:42.419> have<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.630> bit<00:03:42.810> more<00:03:42.959> range

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
I'm actually gonna have a bit more range

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.990 
I'm actually gonna have a bit more range
on<00:03:43.500> my<00:03:43.620> side<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:44.099> can<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.609> know<00:03:44.730> stay<00:03:44.970> a

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
on my side so I can you know stay a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.420 
on my side so I can you know stay a
little<00:03:45.150> further<00:03:45.450> out<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.900> action<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.470> knew

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
little further out of the action I knew

praying<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.819> one<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.060> those<00:03:54.120> no<00:03:54.359> Scouts

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
praying that one of those no Scouts

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.759 
praying that one of those no Scouts
would<00:03:54.780> hear<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.049> but<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:55.319> never<00:03:55.470> worth

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
would hear it but it's never worth

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.909 
would hear it but it's never worth
relying<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.000> noscope<00:03:57.510> he's<00:03:58.260> gonna<00:03:58.500> be<00:03:58.709> one

that's unfortunate I was expecting him
to<00:05:13.610> move<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.480> opposite<00:05:14.780> direction<00:05:14.980> no
