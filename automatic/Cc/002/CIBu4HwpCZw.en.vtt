 Welcome to my mini let's play too 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.210
 great smash brothers for the nintendo 64 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:30.110
 understood why I fell down 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:37.430
 I did not move a millimeter 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:39.980
 sylvies but let me unfold that 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.260
 little really cool there we do not see 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.260
 but really wanted what is going on 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:01:12.320
 I did not think that this 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:14.650
 Ausraster gives this stupid thing age 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 man 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.370
 we had to do that because they did a lot 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.470
 fat and old, but somehow evil 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.350
 especially as bright turn puts so right 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.120
 bent like an old man and he hears 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.740
 also like that 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.850
 then it comes up to the high 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.630
 It will take forever for him to recover 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.630
 aufrappelt 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:02:00.369

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.599
 in the back anyway , I would not have too 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.590
 super works determined against the action 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:25.180
 yes I imagine the situation of 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:32.000
 String bearded plumber from Brooklyn 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:34.040
 I hope I'm not typing so well 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.230

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.370

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.019

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.959

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.880
