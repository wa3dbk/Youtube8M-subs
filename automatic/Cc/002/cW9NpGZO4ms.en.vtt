room<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.630> made<00:00:27.810> its<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.050> nvidia<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> videos

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.229 
room it's made its an nvidia and videos
i<00:00:30.779> believe<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.439> videos<00:00:31.890> were<00:00:32.309> tested<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
i believe that in videos were tested for

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.950 
i believe that in videos were tested for
the<00:00:34.140> intel<00:00:34.620> chips<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.030> mean<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.360> got<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> base

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the intel chips so I mean I got the base

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
the intel chips so I mean I got the base
Mac<00:00:37.290> Pro<00:00:37.559> I'll<00:00:37.710> eventually<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.280> prayed<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
graphics card well i really don't have

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299 
graphics card well i really don't have
much<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.149> preference<00:00:54.570> i<00:00:54.809> would<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
