00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.320 

Hey<00:00:01.770> so<00:00:02.429> I'm<00:00:02.850> stretching<00:00:03.389> from<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.080> 2<00:00:04.650> gauge<00:00:05.330> to

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
Hey so I'm stretching from a 2 gauge to

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.919 
Hey so I'm stretching from a 2 gauge to
a<00:00:06.359> zero<00:00:07.350> gauge<00:00:07.859> which<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.760> probably<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
a zero gauge which is probably the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.610 
a zero gauge which is probably the
biggest<00:00:10.590> stretch<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.250> will<00:00:11.460> make<00:00:12.320> other<00:00:13.320> than

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
biggest stretch you will make other than

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.310 
biggest stretch you will make other than
maybe<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.130> think<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.580> zero<00:00:14.820> two<00:00:15.059> zero<00:00:16.049> zero

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
maybe I think at the zero two zero zero

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.400 
maybe I think at the zero two zero zero
to<00:00:17.070> double<00:00:17.580> zero<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> also<00:00:18.199> pretty<00:00:19.199> piece

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to double zero is also pretty piece

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.880 
to double zero is also pretty piece
watch<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.279> gonna<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.550> putting<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:20.910> these

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
watch so I'm gonna be putting on these

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.370 
watch so I'm gonna be putting on these
it's<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.900> not<00:00:24.900> obviously<00:00:25.140> see

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it's kind of like that not obviously see

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.720 
it's kind of like that not obviously see
that<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.859> same<00:00:26.039> gauge<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.670> everything

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
that the same gauge and everything

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.500 
that the same gauge and everything
poopee<00:00:30.380> right<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:33.140> first<00:00:34.140> put<00:00:34.559> some<00:00:34.739> jelly<00:00:35.510> on

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
poopee right now first put some jelly on

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
poopee right now first put some jelly on

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.550 

stretched<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:04.979> long<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:06.020> like<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.260> weird

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560

my<00:02:09.910> god<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:13.350> mean<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.440> hurts<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.220> moment

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
my god I mean it hurts in the moment

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.810 
my god I mean it hurts in the moment
definitely<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:17.040> definitely<00:02:18.040> was<00:02:18.430> that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
definitely but it definitely was that

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.310 
definitely but it definitely was that
definitely<00:02:19.240> was<00:02:19.390> more<00:02:19.600> pain<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.080> most

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
definitely was more pain the most

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.190 
definitely was more pain the most
painful<00:02:20.770> stretch<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.220> done<00:02:22.200> obviously

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
painful stretch it done obviously

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.800 
painful stretch it done obviously
because<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.560> too<00:02:24.220> milk<00:02:24.490> jump<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.390> millimeter

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
because it's too milk jump to millimeter

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.040 
because it's too milk jump to millimeter
jump<00:02:26.910> about<00:02:27.910> anyways<00:02:28.830> yeah<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.250> here's<00:02:30.520> my<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
jump about anyways yeah so here's my to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.200 
jump about anyways yeah so here's my to
gauge<00:02:32.320> tunnels<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.760> gauge<00:02:36.970> but<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:39.210> definitely

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
gauge tunnels to gauge but I definitely

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:48.750 
gauge tunnels to gauge but I definitely
do<00:02:40.570> like<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.870> hearing<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.800> this<00:02:48.400> one's<00:02:48.610> ever

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
do like the hearing so this one's ever

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.400 
do like the hearing so this one's ever
gonna<00:02:48.940> hurt<00:02:49.120> cuz<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.720> my<00:02:49.750> problematic

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
gonna hurt cuz this is my problematic

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.020 
gonna hurt cuz this is my problematic
here<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:53.400> probably<00:02:54.400> should've<00:02:54.730> done<00:02:54.790> this

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
here so I probably should've done this

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:23.280 
here so I probably should've done this
numbers<00:03:11.370> around<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:15.090> make<00:03:16.090> sure<00:03:16.120> my<00:03:18.180> ear<00:03:22.290> so

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
numbers around it make sure my ear so

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.290 
numbers around it make sure my ear so
this<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.950> showed<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.370> before<00:03:24.490> but<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:25.060> is
