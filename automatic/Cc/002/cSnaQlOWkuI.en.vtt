00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello and svami I l'cy I am now 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.629
 show you how to learn the strongest 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.690
 weapons in dark souls 2 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.179
 probably you think it's a katana or 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.929
 some big sledgehammer but no 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.510
 This is a ladle cook, I think not all 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.420
 know how to get this imbalance 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.760
 and weapons to give you need to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.359
 tutorial locations kill two hits 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.490
 who inhabit the beach near the coffin i 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.380
 I do not know why they are called about gram I 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 Hippo they call them the same 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.969
 pretty with one eye think 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.320
 bite your head a couple of times that I 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.230
 time dodge 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.629
 that's just the same video I got on these 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 ogres and now i will show you how you can 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 quickly kill and behind we lowered a tree 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.710
 during the tutorial just 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 with the grief of these ogres we go to this 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 tree and just do roll on this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 tree to Agar You tried to kill her 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.000
 when he flop back will do 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.520
 coup he fall into the water 2 ogres so 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.100
 kill will not work because he is yours 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.479
 there will not go because the Ogara zone 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 it will be smaller 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.180
 and it will just fill up neatly 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.729
 Well, or you can also try to throw it off 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.229
 in fact there is plenty of room on the side 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.439
 where can he fall 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 but I'm like real knights taking a character 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.960
 on dex for this video decided by 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.229
 roll there in all directions with 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.720
 his saber and in the end it turned out the same 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.720
 the most as in the first series of passage 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.740
 but my pronounced curvature gave about himself 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.300
 know and if you are like glory 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.450
 god if you killed 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.220
 1 grown again will not sleep so 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.369
 you will need to fight only with 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.190
 second but after that comes for its 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.910
 awards mile misfortunes she will give you this 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.910
 pilgrim 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.920
 this formidable weapon is so harsh that 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.920
 his backswing is the same as morgin stern and 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.190
 for example, and it requires a lot 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.430
 stamina so you go nuts how fast you are 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.310
 have achieved for that just look at 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.210
 this crazy damage zombies fly off on 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.000
 one two 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.160
 it only takes five or six hits 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.490
 who spend all your mouth but when 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.200
 In this you do not kill the enemy 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.540
 don't really know what to say about it 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.460
 ladles you just look 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.840
 seriously what katanas are there 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.270
 the greatest weapons that can be 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.180
 get just by killing the hippo here 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.250
 the very beginning of the game this ladle can 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.550
 The whole game is easy to pass 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.840
 have you seen how fast it breaks 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.300
 for it is the only negative but the damage is worth 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.200
 to break after 30 hits 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.750
 then did you see this cool 63 damage 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.910
 just fell zealous stats 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.540
 dagger with its two and a half 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.750
 thousands resting just what else on 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.700
 dogs went to pvp i'm sure i'm sure 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.510
 all people run away at the sight of my 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.600
 ladle 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.610
 Well, that's what I said the enemy is not 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.550
 you can find everyone heard that I have 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.580
 ladle and immediately opp taking into account or 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.160
 want to fight you opponent 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.930
 found and here is the fire ladle of death 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.540
 goes hunting 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.000
 you see an opponent so scared 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.030
 of my super weapon that immediately 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.220
 drank everything with an ace and well then I decided not to 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.040
 to eat or wait for him to drink 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.410
 estusa I realized that with such damage I will kill 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.080
 its pretty fast and right here 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.570
 a critical error occurred i fell down 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.900
 but she still did not stop me from holding 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.630
 good positions you just look already 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.870
 a whole hundred damage to my fiery 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.300
 ladle here is good that I managed 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.650
 roll and word armed 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.330
 went on the attack and here I was polished and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.330
 i lost 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.690
 not because this ladle is full 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:25.770
 shit just because i'm still 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.510
 more crappy pvp shlek well here I am 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.820
 finished the story about this 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.370
 imbalance weapons in the game him a lesson 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.550
 sarcasm and ends up speaking at 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 purity and this is the only weapon not yet 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.220
 he is less than a punch and she has 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.190
 the lowest strength in the game but at 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.490
 This does not prevent you from using only 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.800
 these arms go through the whole game well, and in this 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.390
