00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
works out great now it removes bacteria

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.270

it's almost like a Maura neck knife and
that's<00:01:47.200> exactly<00:01:47.560> what<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:47.950> would<00:01:48.100> compare<00:01:48.579> it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
that's exactly what I would compare it

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.429
