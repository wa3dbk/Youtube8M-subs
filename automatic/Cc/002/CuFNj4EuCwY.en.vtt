00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.510
 Hello 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.100
 in this meeting 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:16.560
 I want to give you the suggestions of how 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.710
 remove the fat from the hash 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.410
 they left the suggestion to this one because I know 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.390
 that due to health problems 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.520
 many people love picadillo but 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.890
 they can not eat it simply because 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.480
 was in the high fat content that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.860
 have then we go to the suggestion 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.300
 let's take the hash that you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.440
 want to cook and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.440
 and then to put 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.730
 in a container that can go to the fire and 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.360
 what's going 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.860
 In the container 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.640
 he's going to pour water he's going to pour water 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.370
 to cover it and put it on fire 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 what did you say the neighborhood is going to 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.740
 put on fire and when it starts to rise 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.350
 lower the fire and keep it boiling 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.810
 approximately two minutes nothing else is 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 we just want to get rid of 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.040
 grease 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.500
 well see you see how 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.810
 but the picadillo covered with 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.810
 liquid is submerged in all the water 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.690
 that is, when the hot water goes 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 to get to everything that is the peccadillo and 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.420
 his grace 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.270
 Now let's open it for two 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.760
 minutes as I told you always 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.970
 watching the later we leave it 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.110
 cool after it's cool almost 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.350
 cold we put it in the refrigerator 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.930
 when 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.420
 cool the fat is going to go 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.240
 detaching and the fat is going to go 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.429
 freezing up and that's what 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.429
 we'll see later, let's go and cook 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.920
 once served the picadillo for two 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.920
 minutes 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.270
 we were letting it rest and refresh 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.600
 this is very important 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.250
 I observed the color you acquired not the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.470
 points of these clearer that has 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.310
 above that are natural own cubes 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.550
 of the flesh but that yellow color 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.270
 dark that is acquiring that is the 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.320
 fat that is already rising and 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.220
 start thinking now is in process 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.200
 of solidification that we are going to complete 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.770
 and do it much more quickly in the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.770
 fridge 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.890
 we already take the picadillo with the water 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.700
 refrigerator observe how the grease 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:19.230
 froze and covered the surface then 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.230
 now we are going to download it to detach 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.980
 see how the layer is fragmented 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.769
 thick that was formed 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.860
 and then we started to take it out let's 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.810
 try to have something flat 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.810
 how is this spoon to see them 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.550
 saw how much fat you can 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.550
 remove 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.560
 see 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.980
 It is a lake 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.980
 of thanks 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.220
 is observing the amount of fat that 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.220
 we have been taking him out 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.510
 that is to say that this hash has 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.310
 practically 90% of the fat 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.380
 eliminated 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.380
 I would say that a cow of 5 considered 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.530
 all right 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.220
 if we are worried that he has stayed 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.990
 had the walls of the container 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.230
 some fats because we change it from 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.230
 container 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.350
 we change it from the container 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.630
 and ready 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.780
 all right 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:28.000
 saw that free and where thank you now this 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.280
 remaining liquid is the juice that I had 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.670
 the flesh the common and detached with the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.700
 Water 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.730
 then we are going to save it, we are going to 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.510
 have here for a next occasion in 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.550
 I am going to show you how to elaborate 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.129
 aesthetics of it was going to be delicious 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.050
 with that same amount of liquid 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.050
 until a next meeting and thanks
