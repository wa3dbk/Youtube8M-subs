can see by the back there are some

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.340 
can see by the back there are some
inputs<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.920> I'll<00:01:08.070> explain<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:10.140> ones

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
inputs that I'll explain now the ones

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
inputs that I'll explain now the ones
first<00:01:10.740> we're<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> cover<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> Wi-Fi

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
first we're going to cover is the Wi-Fi

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
first we're going to cover is the Wi-Fi
antenna<00:01:12.840> ok<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.740> obviously<00:01:13.979> gives<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
antenna ok so obviously gives you that

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.800 
antenna ok so obviously gives you that
decent<00:01:15.330> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.780> signal<00:01:16.729> down<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> back<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
decent Wi-Fi signal down on the back of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
decent Wi-Fi signal down on the back of
the<00:01:18.990> device<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.009> left<00:01:20.040> hand<00:01:20.729> side<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.360> do

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the device on the left hand side you do

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.359 
the device on the left hand side you do
get<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> Ethernet<00:01:22.530> port<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.950> connect<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.310> your

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
get the Ethernet port to connect to your

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.630 
get the Ethernet port to connect to your
LAN<00:01:23.640> network<00:01:24.200> ok<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> also<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> USB

to a PC on the right-hand side you do

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.990 
to a PC on the right-hand side you do
get<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> power<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.159> aux<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.820> well

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
get the power in and the aux in as well

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
get the power in and the aux in as well
as<00:01:36.270> long<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.990> well<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> network
