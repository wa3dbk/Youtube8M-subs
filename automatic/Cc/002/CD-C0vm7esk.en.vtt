hello Diana hello hi um the planets

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.130 
hello Diana hello hi um the planets
there's<00:00:05.820> really<00:00:06.180> on<00:00:06.420> this<00:00:06.569> planet<00:00:06.930> right<00:00:07.110> now

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.079 
there's really on this planet right now
a<00:00:07.319> change<00:00:07.799> in<00:00:08.040> frequency<00:00:08.759> and<00:00:08.940> vibration

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:09.089 
a change in frequency and vibration

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.699 
a change in frequency and vibration
what's<00:00:09.959> going<00:00:10.349> on<00:00:10.499> what<00:00:11.749> change<00:00:12.749> yes<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.469> can

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:13.709 
what's going on what change yes we can

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.680 
what's going on what change yes we can
prepare<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.339> it<00:00:14.459> and<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.969> angels<00:00:15.389> are<00:00:15.539> coming

now<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.320> mass<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.010> help<00:00:17.250> us<00:00:17.430> prepare<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
now on mass to help us prepare and the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.690 
now on mass to help us prepare and the
unicorns<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.650> orbs<00:00:20.040> that<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.400> see

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
unicorns and the orbs that we see

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.760 
unicorns and the orbs that we see
because<00:00:21.540> we're<00:00:21.750> moving<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.500> third

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
because we're moving from a third

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.440 
because we're moving from a third
dimensional<00:00:23.430> planet<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> fifth

dimensional planet in a very short space
of<00:00:26.970> time<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.830> frequency<00:00:29.310> arises<00:00:30.090> so

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
of time and as the frequency arises so

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.899 
of time and as the frequency arises so
we're<00:00:31.020> able<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.470> connect<00:00:31.950> to<00:00:32.279> more<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:32.909 
we're able to connect to more of the

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.299 
we're able to connect to more of the
angelic<00:00:33.030> beings<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:34.289> the<00:00:34.440> higher<00:00:34.769> and<00:00:35.100> faster

frequency<00:00:36.149> beings<00:00:36.539> all<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.379> whom<00:00:37.589> can<00:00:37.859> help<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
frequency beings all of whom can help to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.029 
frequency beings all of whom can help to
raise<00:00:38.489> our<00:00:38.730> frequency<00:00:39.319> because<00:00:40.319> really<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
raise our frequency because really the

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.029 
raise our frequency because really the
planet<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.670> rising<00:00:42.210> towards<00:00:42.749> ascension<00:00:43.409> so

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
planet is rising towards ascension so

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.590 
planet is rising towards ascension so
that<00:00:44.249> everybody<00:00:44.819> can<00:00:45.059> become<00:00:45.390> enlightened

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that everybody can become enlightened

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.579 
that everybody can become enlightened
and<00:00:46.260> ascend<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.370> by<00:00:47.609> ascension<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.479> mean<00:00:48.749> bring

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
and ascend and by ascension I mean bring

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.520 
and ascend and by ascension I mean bring
in<00:00:49.620> more<00:00:50.579> light<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.210> their<00:00:51.479> iron<00:00:51.899> presents

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
in more light from their iron presents

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.309 
in more light from their iron presents
their<00:00:52.710> original<00:00:53.190> divine<00:00:53.579> spark<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:55.019> have

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:55.319 
their original divine spark and we have

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.069 
their original divine spark and we have
a<00:00:55.699> massive<00:00:56.699> opportunity<00:00:56.999> for<00:00:57.600> spiritual

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
a massive opportunity for spiritual

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.289 
a massive opportunity for spiritual
growth<00:00:58.199> now<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:59.309> than<00:00:59.429> we<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.729> ever<00:01:00.179> had

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
growth now more than we have ever had

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.469 
growth now more than we have ever had
before<00:01:00.479> and<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:02.460> universes<00:01:03.269> are

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
before and all the universes are

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.400 
before and all the universes are
watching<00:01:04.260> us<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.950> awe<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.820> wonder<00:01:06.300> as<00:01:06.480> we<00:01:07.050> make

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
watching us in awe and wonder as we make

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
watching us in awe and wonder as we make
this<00:01:07.760> transformational<00:01:08.760> leap<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.510> humankind

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
this transformational leap for humankind

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.540 
this transformational leap for humankind
mmm

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
mmm

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.580 
mmm
so<00:01:11.910> it's<00:01:12.120> up<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> us<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> raise<00:01:13.200> our<00:01:13.380> frequency

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so it's up to us to raise our frequency

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.150 
so it's up to us to raise our frequency
it's<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> us<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.940> open<00:01:15.750> our<00:01:15.900> hearts<00:01:16.410> yeah

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
it's up to us to open our hearts yeah

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.370 
it's up to us to open our hearts yeah
it's<00:01:17.580> mainly<00:01:17.970> about<00:01:18.420> opening<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.140> heart

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it's mainly about opening the heart

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.590 
it's mainly about opening the heart
center<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.730> this<00:01:20.910> by<00:01:21.120> walking<00:01:21.480> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
center and you can do this by walking in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
center and you can do this by walking in
nature<00:01:21.810> by<00:01:22.320> working<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.860> animals<00:01:23.370> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
nature by working with animals just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.260 
nature by working with animals just
sending<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.420> love<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> helping<00:01:25.740> them<00:01:26.010> and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
sending them love and helping them and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.540 
sending them love and helping them and
by<00:01:27.270> making<00:01:28.080> sure<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:29.010> out<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
by making sure that you go out and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.090 
by making sure that you go out and
ground<00:01:29.910> yourself<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.630> nature<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.860> there

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
ground yourself in nature because there

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.850 
ground yourself in nature because there
were<00:01:32.160> two<00:01:32.430> cosmic<00:01:32.940> moments<00:01:33.420> coming<00:01:33.870> one<00:01:34.590> on

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
