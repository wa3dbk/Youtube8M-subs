00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.889
 the threat of winter flooding many residents 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:05.060
 Khakassia today are afraid of flooding 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.180
 after the accident at Sayano Shushenskaya hydroelectric station in 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.030
 Krasnoyarsk water reservoir 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.969
 start arriving that will say to that 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.419
 specialist 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.699
 water area pastoral reservoir beginning 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.169
 to fill up after a catastrophe on sayan 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.380
 Shushenskaya hydroelectric station 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.380
 the inhabitants of Khakassia, the so-called 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.679
 floods are associated with the accident 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.779
 The stations say this reason experts 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.550
 but only partly 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.500
 went to the reservoir again 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.039
 and once again convinced 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.150
 there is no danger and the water level 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.290
 low and good protection 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.559
 four times already 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.550
 the reservoir was filled before this 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.850
 marks therefore some 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.760
 flooding takes place to be obtained 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.719
 new year by year is nothing and no one 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 threatened 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.100
 this is a normal working condition 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.670
 Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric coastal residents 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.620
 build worry that their there a 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.900
 the water coming is sure to flood 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.170
 but the misery say all fears are in vain 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.020
 krasnoyarsk reservoir in 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.310
 People also call the sea 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.880
 if really sometimes 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.690
 developing very widely behind my back 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.380
 Now water is usually 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.290
 the largest influx was exactly 17 years ago at 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.690
 October ninety second year and even 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.180
 then to the maximum level 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 12 centimeters left and now 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200
 it is far away at all 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.880
 maximum measures at Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric station to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.549
 a critical mark of 36 centimeters across 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.920
 he will not be crossed by Putin's guests for 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.690
 this will follow 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.420
 take part 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.550
 so to speak 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.970
 in monitoring this situation then the level 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.870
 water he was though it is not our main 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.570
 task but 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.140
 as we have 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.580
 on the equipment is at the court of the corresponding 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.290
 including vodka 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.400
 hovercraft large 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.370
 inflow into the Krasnoyarsk reservoir give 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.810
 lateral tributary of the yenisei river abakan on 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.370
 tobacco 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.680
 they say that this year's record 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.479
 indicators 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 but with 8 less 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.710
 and already at the beginning of winter the agency assures 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.010
 floods in the water area 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.240
 Krasnoyarsk reservoir 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.440
 people will be forgotten 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.500
 Olesya Krechetova and the words of the guard 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.520
 lead Khakassia
