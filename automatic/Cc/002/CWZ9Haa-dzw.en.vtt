going<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:46.550> I've<00:00:47.550> seen<00:00:47.820> better<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
going on here I've seen better but it is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
going on here I've seen better but it is
unique<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.520> doesn't<00:00:50.820> look<00:00:50.850> too<00:00:51.180> terrible

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
unique and it doesn't look too terrible

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.010 
unique and it doesn't look too terrible
it<00:00:51.899> fits<00:00:52.289> nicely<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> stats<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> has

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it fits nicely as for the stats it has

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.110 
it fits nicely as for the stats it has
fusion<00:00:55.530> rifle<00:00:55.829> ammo<00:00:56.129> nothing<00:00:56.640> special<00:00:56.910> about

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
fusion rifle ammo nothing special about

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.470 
fusion rifle ammo nothing special about
that<00:00:57.410> upgrade<00:00:58.410> defense<00:00:59.149> nothing<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that upgrade defense nothing really to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
that upgrade defense nothing really to
special<00:01:00.780> about<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.109> however<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> heavy

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
special about that however the heavy

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.460 
special about that however the heavy
weapon<00:01:02.670> ammo<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.480> increases<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.110> amount<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
weapon ammo it increases the amount of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
weapon ammo it increases the amount of
heavy<00:01:04.860> weapon<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.430> ammunition<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.909> can

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
heavy weapon and ammunition you can

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
heavy weapon and ammunition you can
carry<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> great<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.049> rockets<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.830> let

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
carry this is great for rockets and let

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.990 
carry this is great for rockets and let
me<00:01:08.070> explain<00:01:08.159> why<00:01:09.350> say<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.490> rocket

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
me explain why say if you have a rocket

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.830 
me explain why say if you have a rocket
launcher<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.900> three<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.189> tube<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
launcher that has three in a tube that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060 
launcher that has three in a tube that
means<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.439> through<00:01:16.680> rockets

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
means you're going through rockets

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.710 
means you're going through rockets
really<00:01:17.460> quickly<00:01:17.850> when<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.119> firing<00:01:18.420> them

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
really quickly when you're firing them

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.280 
really quickly when you're firing them
to<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.200> most<00:01:19.380> damage<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:21.290> when

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to get your most damage out of it when

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
to get your most damage out of it when
you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.560> pick<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.310> heavy<00:01:23.700> weapon

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you can pick up more heavy weapon

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.660 
you can pick up more heavy weapon
ammunition<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.650> max<00:01:25.920> I'd<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.460> means

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
ammunition at your max I'd that means

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.920 
ammunition at your max I'd that means
when<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> actually<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.939> weapon<00:01:29.939> ammo

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
when you actually get the weapon ammo

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350 
when you actually get the weapon ammo
pack<00:01:31.140> you'll<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.070> getting<00:01:32.280> more<00:01:32.520> ammo<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
pack you'll be getting more ammo from it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840 
pack you'll be getting more ammo from it
because<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.780> based<00:01:33.990> off<00:01:34.170> percents<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:35.610> least

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
because it's based off percents at least

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.749 
because it's based off percents at least
I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:37.200> beforehand<00:01:38.159> i'll<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.490> one

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
I think it is up beforehand i'll get one

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.390 
I think it is up beforehand i'll get one
two<00:01:39.060> maybe<00:01:39.540> three<00:01:40.049> rockets<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> pack

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
two maybe three rockets out of a pack

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.090 
two maybe three rockets out of a pack
now<00:01:42.119> i<00:01:42.150> usually<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.930> three<00:01:43.200> four<00:01:43.619> maybe<00:01:43.890> five

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
now i usually get three four maybe five

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.179 
now i usually get three four maybe five
it<00:01:44.759> does<00:01:45.450> make<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.659> difference<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.140> PvE<00:01:46.409> however

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it does make a difference in PvE however

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.740 
it does make a difference in PvE however
it's<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:48.479> important<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.020> PvP<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> find

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
it's more important in PvP I find

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's more important in PvP I find
rockets<00:01:51.750> will<00:01:52.320> one-shot<00:01:52.799> people<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.640> if

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
rockets will one-shot people so if

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.249 
rockets will one-shot people so if
you're<00:01:53.970> good<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.240> rockets<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.990> are

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you're good with rockets you are

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.569 
you're good with rockets you are
completely<00:01:56.689> cleaning<00:01:57.689> house<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.579> can

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
completely cleaning house with it I can

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.609 
completely cleaning house with it I can
shoot<00:01:59.759> three<00:01:59.939> rockets<00:02:00.240> at<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> time<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:01.140> since

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
shoot three rockets at a time but since

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
shoot three rockets at a time but since
