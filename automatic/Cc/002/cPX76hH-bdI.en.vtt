into<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> blue<00:00:52.170> portal<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:53.100> each<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.489> of

into the blue portal now each one of
these<00:00:53.940> objects<00:00:54.510> has<00:00:54.690> different<00:00:55.050> sort<00:00:55.199> of

menu<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.149> actually<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.719> what<00:00:58.320> each<00:00:58.500> one

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
menu you can actually see what each one

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.729 
menu you can actually see what each one
does<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> what's<00:01:00.629> interesting<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.199> found<00:01:01.500> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
does but what's interesting I found is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.470 
does but what's interesting I found is
that<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> actually<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.730> multi<00:01:03.270> touch

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that you can actually have multi touch

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.920 
that you can actually have multi touch
and<00:01:03.870> drag<00:01:04.350> them<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.750> toss<00:01:06.750> them

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and drag them in like that and toss them

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.910 
and drag them in like that and toss them
in<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.799> careful

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
in there now you do want to be careful

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
in there now you do want to be careful
because<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.490> whip<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.670> across<00:01:09.000> too<00:01:09.210> fast

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
because if you whip it across too fast

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
because if you whip it across too fast
it'll<00:01:09.990> disappear<00:01:10.380> off<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> screen<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it'll disappear off the screen and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.350 
it'll disappear off the screen and
that's<00:01:11.280> gone<00:01:11.490> forever<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.030> whole<00:01:12.150> point

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that's gone forever and the whole point

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
that's gone forever and the whole point
of<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.200> many<00:01:13.530> points<00:01:14.040> as

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
of this is to get as many points as

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.149 
of this is to get as many points as
possible<00:01:14.780> now<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.380> goes<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.070> I'll

interesting I'm go ahead and jump into

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.510 
interesting I'm go ahead and jump into
the<00:01:20.729> levels<00:01:20.970> back<00:01:21.180> again<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> I'll<00:01:23.340> jump

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the levels back again here and I'll jump

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
the levels back again here and I'll jump
into<00:01:23.670> level<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> we'll<00:01:25.110> show<00:01:25.170> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
into level for now and we'll show you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.510 
into level for now and we'll show you
how<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.710> starts<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.130> interesting

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
how it starts to get really interesting

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
how it starts to get really interesting
here<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.540> you'll<00:01:27.720> notice<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> sides<00:01:28.530> we

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
here so you'll notice on the sides we

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
here so you'll notice on the sides we
have<00:01:29.040> these<00:01:29.250> two<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.610> bars<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.630> what

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
have these two little bars here now what

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289 
have these two little bars here now what
happens<00:01:31.200> when<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.890> bounce<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.000> bars

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
happens when I bounce them off the bars

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.530 
happens when I bounce them off the bars
is<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.979> point<00:01:35.250> multiplier<00:01:35.970> now

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
is they have a point multiplier now

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.330 
is they have a point multiplier now
what's<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.170> throw<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> mix<00:01:38.040> they<00:01:38.189> also

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
what's to throw it in the mix they also

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010 
what's to throw it in the mix they also
have<00:01:38.579> these<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:38.820> sort<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> minds<00:01:39.900> or

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
have these little sort of minds or

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.679 
have these little sort of minds or
obstacles<00:01:40.590> where<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.490> orb<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.390> whatever

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
obstacles where if your orb or whatever

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.510 
obstacles where if your orb or whatever
it<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.869> hits<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:43.770> disappears<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it is hits it it just disappears and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.950 
it is hits it it just disappears and
obviously<00:01:44.909> you're<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> gain<00:01:45.780> any

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
obviously you're not going to gain any

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
obviously you're not going to gain any
points<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.700> want<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
points for that so if you really want to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.550 
points for that so if you really want to
be<00:01:48.030> good<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.420> eat<00:01:48.570> fling<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> across<00:01:49.229> really

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
be good about eat fling it across really

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
be good about eat fling it across really
quickly<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> bar<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.460> bounces<00:01:51.060> gets<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
quickly to the bar it bounces gets the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
quickly to the bar it bounces gets the
points<00:01:51.810> multiplier<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> finds<00:01:53.220> its<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.399> its

on<00:04:32.940> how<00:04:33.060> they<00:04:33.180> did<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.419> what<00:04:33.629> I'm<00:04:33.720> not<00:04:33.840> going

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
on how they did this what I'm not going

on how they did this what I'm not going
to<00:04:34.020> blame<00:04:34.169> them<00:04:34.349> because<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.680> paid<00:04:34.860> version

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
to blame them because the paid version

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.830 
to blame them because the paid version
is<00:04:35.190> pretty<00:04:35.340> good<00:04:35.460> but<00:04:35.669> if<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.449> do<00:04:36.569> have<00:04:36.720> the
