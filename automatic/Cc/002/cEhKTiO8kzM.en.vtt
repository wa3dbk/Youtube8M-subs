kuz<00:04:13.110> types<00:04:13.530> are<00:04:13.799> unknowns<00:04:14.310> basically<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.000> have

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
kuz types are unknowns basically I have

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.460 
kuz types are unknowns basically I have
no<00:04:15.450> idea<00:04:15.750> what<00:04:15.959> you

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
no idea what you

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.750 
no idea what you
of<00:04:17.829> course<00:04:18.100> but<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.820> failed<00:04:19.290> stop<00:04:20.290> failing

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.030 

let's<00:04:24.330> check<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.600> master<00:04:25.020> ball<00:04:25.200> for<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.410> fun<00:04:25.710> I

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
let's check a master ball for the fun I

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.190 
let's check a master ball for the fun I
guess

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.380 

yeah<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:30.130> course<00:04:30.340> it's<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.640> brick

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
yeah of course it's a brick

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.270 
yeah of course it's a brick
Ella

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.300 

you<00:04:35.280> can't<00:04:35.639> affect

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.070 

I<00:04:38.370> think<00:04:39.120> most<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.420> them<00:04:39.510> comes<00:04:39.750> with<00:04:39.990> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
I think most of them comes with the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.680 
I think most of them comes with the
moves<00:04:40.290> jamming<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.430> some<00:04:42.060> other<00:04:42.180> things<00:04:42.300> that

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
moves jamming and some other things that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
moves jamming and some other things that
I<00:04:42.960> don't<00:04:43.200> know<00:04:43.380> but<00:04:44.010> they<00:04:44.160> got<00:04:44.190> ruined

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
I don't know but they got ruined

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.430 
I don't know but they got ruined
