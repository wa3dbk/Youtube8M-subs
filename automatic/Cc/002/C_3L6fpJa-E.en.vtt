 every time we visit something through the

 keyboard because the idea also lasts this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.740
 video is to deactivate the vibration of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.660
 keyboard the next is to activate the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.380
 vibration of the screen and in the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.480
 next is to activate the sounds when 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.829

 we invite you to that our new 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 website tricks to make room for 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 dot com cell phones where they can 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 find a complete list all 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.430
 tricks and videos that we have already done since 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 cell and other dollars then we go 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.540
 with the procedure as such of how 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.760
 eliminate by what happens here 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.700
 we use for example the keyboard k 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.080
 Carlos and introduce book text in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.350
 this case you suddenly are not 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 feeling but the keyboard vibrates and also 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.940
 of that sounds what we want to eliminate in 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 the vibration of the keyboard and with this 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.350
 we can also knit earn a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 little bit of vibration battery like this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.010
 that the battery runs out faster for 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 delete this keyboard duration 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.530
 simply what we do is the link 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.050
 doctor 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.700
 let's finish by configuration 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.160
 we enter configuration configuration 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.110
 remember that we are visiting something 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 when we are typing something we are 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.900
 doing things that have to do with 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.350
 keyboard 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.090
 let's go here to language and input 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.840
 of data and what we do is download 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.119
 we enter here and it tells us bubble key 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.890
 we are here and here is the option of 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.979
 start vibrates when you press the keys 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.530
 we just activate and that's how it is 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.970
 simple we have disabled 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.350
 here is another option is that we do not 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.680
 interest we can disable the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.420
 vibration when entering data by 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.700
 keyboard let's do the test to see if 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.260
 indeed the duration was eliminated is 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.330
 exactly at this moment the keyboard 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.959
 is not achieving when I enter text 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.300
 but if it frees me when I digit or squeezed 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.310
 any other part of the screen what 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.870
 which will be part of the following good in 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.840
 this time only the keyboard was left 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 sounding commands vibrating especially for 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.970

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.400
