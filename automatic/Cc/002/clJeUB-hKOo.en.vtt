 mind that vampires and werewolves 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.820
 they ran freely until a shaman 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.440
 he cursed them to limit their power from 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.910

 the power of a place marked by 100 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.750

 so what is klaus werewolf 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.890
 vampire 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.260
 he told me stories about vampires but 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.720
 I never thought it could be sad 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.010
 it's the curse that sorcerers 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.450
 servants of nature left the 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.710
 part of my brother's werewolf 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.840
 asleep 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.600
 Goni can kill Clau without suffering damage

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.420
 to the hell 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.160
 Klaus is a vampire of a lineage of 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.840
 werewolves the curse prevents the 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.210
 werewolf manifest but if the 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.980

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.690
 transmit a message the sacrifice will be 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.000
 tonight the ritual is relatively 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.500
 simple is a witch who will analyze the 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.960
 power of the full moon to release the 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.360
 spell linked to the stone after 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.920
 klaus as a werewolf and vampires 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.050
 will sacrifice one of each species and 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.040
 winning klaus must drink the blood of the 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.040
 replica to kill 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.479
 without the man then he can not do the 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.979
 ritual tonight first rule have 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.120
