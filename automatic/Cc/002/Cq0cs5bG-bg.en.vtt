mood<00:01:40.170> when<00:01:40.350> I'm<00:01:40.500> trying<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> pixel<00:01:41.939> or

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
mood when I'm trying it to do a pixel or

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
mood when I'm trying it to do a pixel or
like<00:01:42.210> I'll<00:01:42.360> get<00:01:42.509> enough<00:01:42.780> fighting<00:01:43.140> mood<00:01:43.320> when

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
like I'll get enough fighting mood when

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
like I'll get enough fighting mood when
it<00:01:43.619> comes<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> Mortal<00:01:44.159> Kombat<00:01:44.399> I'll<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.970> like

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
it comes to Mortal Kombat I'll get like

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359 
it comes to Mortal Kombat I'll get like
in<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:46.259> say<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> Halo<00:01:47.340> or

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
in a would say if it was like a Halo or

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850 
in a would say if it was like a Halo or
called<00:01:47.850> Duty<00:01:48.180> I'd<00:01:48.329> watch<00:01:48.689> some<00:01:48.990> gameplay<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
called Duty I'd watch some gameplay of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.940 
called Duty I'd watch some gameplay of
that<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.210> play<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.479> afterwards<00:01:51.950> but

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that and want to play it afterwards but

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.429 
that and want to play it afterwards but
yeah<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> murse<00:01:54.060> myself<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.229> know

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
yeah I murse myself in it I know

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.260 
yeah I murse myself in it I know
daylight's<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> does<00:01:57.119> look

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
daylight's going down but it does look

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
daylight's going down but it does look
kind<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.570> cool<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> dark<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.890> I'll<00:01:59.159> let<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
kind of cool in the dark so I'll let the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.630 
kind of cool in the dark so I'll let the
Sun<00:01:59.729> set<00:02:00.049> it'll<00:02:01.049> set<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.829> minute<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
Sun set it'll set about a minute and a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.429 
Sun set it'll set about a minute and a
half<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.570> does<00:02:03.840> look<00:02:04.020> cool<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
half but this does look cool with the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.929 
half but this does look cool with the
Stars<00:02:04.740> behind<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.340> didn't<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.850> don't

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
Stars behind it I just didn't I don't

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.639 
Stars behind it I just didn't I don't
know<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.090> used<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> post<00:02:06.750> pictures<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.170> pixels

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
know I used to post pictures of pixels

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.020 
know I used to post pictures of pixels
in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.399> dark

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
in the dark

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.600 
in the dark
having<00:02:09.390> glowstone<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.860> after<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
having glowstone around it but after a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.070 
having glowstone around it but after a
while<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.849> didn't<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.959> was

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
while I didn't really like it it was

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.780 
while I didn't really like it it was
just<00:02:13.319> too<00:02:13.440> good

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
just too good

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.399 
just too good
Eric<00:02:13.969> I<00:02:14.060> kept<00:02:14.269> doing<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:14.780> every<00:02:14.959> pixel<00:02:15.230> art

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
Eric I kept doing it for every pixel art

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.099 
Eric I kept doing it for every pixel art
and<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.680> lost<00:02:15.920> its<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:17.269> don't<00:02:17.510> know<00:02:17.689> it's

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
and it lost its I don't know it's

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.559 
and it lost its I don't know it's
something<00:02:18.950> special<00:02:19.099> about<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.640> but<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.420> does

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
something special about it but it does

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.119 
something special about it but it does
look<00:02:20.750> cool<00:02:20.930> with<00:02:21.109> the<00:02:21.260> Stars<00:02:21.530> behind<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
look cool with the Stars behind it so

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.640 
look cool with the Stars behind it so
I'll<00:02:22.219> let<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.519> Sun<00:02:22.730> set<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.409> we'll<00:02:24.409> go<00:02:24.530> ahead

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
I'll let the Sun set and we'll go ahead

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.550 
I'll let the Sun set and we'll go ahead
and<00:02:24.799> cut<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:25.219> the<00:02:26.000> sky<00:02:26.569> fading<00:02:27.349> to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and cut to that the sky fading to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.869 
and cut to that the sky fading to
darkness<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.219> could<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:28.489> those<00:02:28.640> little

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
darkness you could see those little

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.130 
darkness you could see those little
lines<00:02:29.239> behind<00:02:29.810> scorpions<00:02:30.590> fading<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.280> stars

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
lines behind scorpions fading the stars

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.819 
lines behind scorpions fading the stars
appearing<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:34.099> looks<00:02:34.400> cool<00:02:35.019> I'm<00:02:36.019> in<00:02:36.290> on<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
appearing this looks cool I'm in on the

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.460 
appearing this looks cool I'm in on the
way<00:02:37.010> I'm<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.939> the<00:02:38.090> way<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.420> pixel<00:02:38.810> art<00:02:39.019> but

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
way I'm in the way of the pixel art but

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.170 
way I'm in the way of the pixel art but
this<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.889> a<00:02:39.920> massive<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:40.639> is<00:02:40.760> one<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
this is a massive this is one of the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.910 
this is a massive this is one of the
largest<00:02:41.540> pixel<00:02:41.930> art<00:02:42.049> I've<00:02:42.230> done<00:02:42.590> I'm<00:02:42.859> not

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
largest pixel art I've done I'm not

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280 
largest pixel art I've done I'm not
exactly<00:02:43.819> sure<00:02:44.030> which<00:02:44.389> one<00:02:44.599> is<00:02:44.689> the<00:02:44.900> tallest

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
exactly sure which one is the tallest

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.649 
exactly sure which one is the tallest
pixel<00:02:45.950> art<00:02:46.129> but<00:02:47.650> see<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.430> has<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.359> be<00:02:50.480> like

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
pixel art but see this is has to be like

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.110 
pixel art but see this is has to be like
the<00:02:50.870> second<00:02:51.769> tallest<00:02:51.980> or<00:02:52.370> perhaps<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.849> third

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
the second tallest or perhaps the third

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.349 
the second tallest or perhaps the third
tallest<00:02:53.329> pixel<00:02:53.870> art<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.290> believe<00:02:55.069> Ultron<00:02:56.060> is

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
tallest pixel art I believe Ultron is

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.270 
tallest pixel art I believe Ultron is
the<00:02:56.659> tallest<00:02:57.049> pixel<00:02:57.590> which<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:57.829> still<00:02:58.040> have<00:02:58.159> to

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
the tallest pixel which I still have to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.890 
the tallest pixel which I still have to
go<00:02:58.400> back<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:58.730> work<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.329> tutorial<00:02:59.750> for

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
go back and work on the tutorial for

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.319 
go back and work on the tutorial for
that<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:00.620> yes<00:03:00.769> this<00:03:00.919> is<00:03:01.069> an<00:03:01.159> extremely<00:03:02.150> large

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
that but yes this is an extremely large

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.000 
that but yes this is an extremely large
pixel<00:03:02.840> art<00:03:02.930> maybe<00:03:03.200> I'll<00:03:03.349> do<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.590> as<00:03:03.680> quick

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
pixel art maybe I'll do it as quick

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.240 
pixel art maybe I'll do it as quick
demonstration<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:05.030> it

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
demonstration of it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.420 
demonstration of it
I<00:03:07.250> need<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.459> block<00:03:07.970> old<00:03:08.750> place<00:03:09.019> let's<00:03:09.859> see<00:03:10.099> well

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
I need a block old place let's see well

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.710 
I need a block old place let's see well
place<00:03:10.609> two<00:03:10.819> different<00:03:11.150> blocks<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.540> can

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
place two different blocks so you can

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.679 
place two different blocks so you can
see<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.049> height<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.919> let's<00:03:13.549> see<00:03:13.760> do<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.359> have<00:03:14.389> it

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
see the height so let's see do I have it

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.819 
see the height so let's see do I have it
do<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.840> have<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.079> do<00:03:15.139> I<00:03:15.169> have<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:15.439> do<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:15.709> it

do I have it do I have it do it have it

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.890 
do I have it do I have it do it have it
inventory<00:03:16.400> there<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:17.120> go<00:03:17.239> there's<00:03:17.450> one<00:03:17.540> and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
inventory there we go there's one and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.729 
inventory there we go there's one and
there's<00:03:18.500> two
