for<00:00:03.340> sport<00:00:03.850> photography<00:00:04.480> the<00:00:04.870> idea<00:00:05.109> is<00:00:05.350> to

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
for sport photography the idea is to

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.769 
for sport photography the idea is to
have<00:00:05.740> a<00:00:05.800> very<00:00:06.130> fast<00:00:06.430> shutter<00:00:06.850> speed<00:00:07.210> so<00:00:07.390> you

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:07.779 
have a very fast shutter speed so you

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.170 
have a very fast shutter speed so you
can<00:00:07.930> stop<00:00:08.200> the<00:00:08.380> motion<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:09.580> in<00:00:09.700> order<00:00:09.820> to<00:00:09.940> set

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
can stop the motion now in order to set

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.420 
can stop the motion now in order to set
this<00:00:10.299> up<00:00:10.510> there<00:00:10.930> are<00:00:11.080> a<00:00:11.170> couple<00:00:11.379> options<00:00:11.619> you

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
this up there are a couple options you

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.520 
this up there are a couple options you
can<00:00:12.610> go<00:00:12.789> with<00:00:13.000> the<00:00:13.600> camera<00:00:13.930> does<00:00:14.080> have<00:00:14.289> an

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
can go with the camera does have an

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.580 
can go with the camera does have an
automatic<00:00:15.190> option<00:00:15.699> you<00:00:16.630> can<00:00:16.840> do<00:00:16.990> this<00:00:17.199> by

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
automatic option you can do this by

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.330 
automatic option you can do this by
moving<00:00:18.010> your<00:00:18.310> mode<00:00:18.490> dial<00:00:18.520> to<00:00:19.680> SCN<00:00:20.680> this<00:00:21.040> dance

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
moving your mode dial to SCN this dance

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.570 
moving your mode dial to SCN this dance
for<00:00:21.520> scene<00:00:21.760> mode<00:00:22.090> and<00:00:22.330> in<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.350> scene<00:00:23.590> mode<00:00:23.890> you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
for scene mode and in the scene mode you

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.990 
for scene mode and in the scene mode you
have<00:00:24.820> access<00:00:25.420> to<00:00:25.840> sport<00:00:26.770> right<00:00:27.460> now<00:00:27.580> I'm<00:00:27.760> set

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
have access to sport right now I'm set

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.680 
have access to sport right now I'm set
up<00:00:28.030> to<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:29.350> portrait<00:00:29.880> profile<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:31.120> can<00:00:31.539> just

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
up to the portrait profile I can just

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.709 
up to the portrait profile I can just
use<00:00:31.840> my<00:00:32.020> dial<00:00:32.430> move<00:00:33.430> that<00:00:33.640> over<00:00:33.820> until<00:00:34.390> I<00:00:34.449> get

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
use my dial move that over until I get

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.560 
use my dial move that over until I get
to<00:00:35.019> sport<00:00:35.519> now<00:00:36.519> with<00:00:36.670> sport<00:00:37.030> what's<00:00:37.390> going<00:00:37.539> to

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
to sport now with sport what's going to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.450 
to sport now with sport what's going to
happen<00:00:37.929> is<00:00:38.140> it's<00:00:38.499> going<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:38.739> do<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.039> best<00:00:39.249> it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
happen is it's going to do the best it

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.809 
happen is it's going to do the best it
can<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:40.359> increase<00:00:40.749> the<00:00:41.409> shutter<00:00:41.620> speed<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.579> for

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:42.819 
can to increase the shutter speed so for

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:45.930 
can to increase the shutter speed so for
example<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.480> press<00:00:44.140> my<00:00:44.289> shutter<00:00:44.530> halfway<00:00:45.460> and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
example I press my shutter halfway and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.790 
example I press my shutter halfway and
you<00:00:46.569> can<00:00:46.690> see<00:00:46.870> right<00:00:47.050> now<00:00:47.229> I'm<00:00:47.800> at<00:00:47.979> ISO<00:00:49.800> 401

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
you can see right now I'm at ISO 401

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.189 
you can see right now I'm at ISO 401
five<00:00:51.190> hundredth<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.819> a<00:00:51.999> second<00:00:52.420> which<00:00:52.839> is<00:00:52.989> very

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
five hundredth of a second which is very

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.840 
five hundredth of a second which is very
fast<00:00:53.469> probably<00:00:54.010> good<00:00:54.129> enough<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:54.519> just<00:00:54.729> about

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
fast probably good enough for just about

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.840 
fast probably good enough for just about
any<00:00:55.089> sport<00:00:55.389> and<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.829> should<00:00:57.069> be<00:00:57.100> just<00:00:57.339> fine<00:00:57.429> I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
any sport and this should be just fine I

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.239 
any sport and this should be just fine I
wouldn't<00:00:58.479> want<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.690> decrease<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.649> ISO<00:01:00.069> from

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
wouldn't want to decrease the ISO from

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.910 
wouldn't want to decrease the ISO from
400<00:01:00.909> at<00:01:01.389> least<00:01:01.629> not<00:01:01.839> with<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.440> current<00:01:02.859> amount

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
400 at least not with the current amount

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.280 
400 at least not with the current amount
of<00:01:03.129> light<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.699> have<00:01:03.940> available<00:01:04.180> because<00:01:04.900> then

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
of light I have available because then

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.560 
of light I have available because then
my<00:01:05.620> shutter<00:01:05.950> speed<00:01:06.010> will<00:01:06.580> decrease<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:07.480> I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
my shutter speed will decrease and I

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.450 
my shutter speed will decrease and I
certainly<00:01:07.810> don't<00:01:08.200> want<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.530> any<00:01:08.710> slower<00:01:09.070> than

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
certainly don't want it any slower than

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
certainly don't want it any slower than
one<00:01:09.640> over<00:01:09.880> five<00:01:10.090> hundredth<00:01:10.480> of<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.660> second

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
one over five hundredth of a second

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.200 
one over five hundredth of a second
the<00:01:13.960> bad<00:01:14.380> part<00:01:14.740> about<00:01:14.950> using<00:01:15.550> this<00:01:15.670> mode<00:01:15.970> is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
the bad part about using this mode is

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.150 
the bad part about using this mode is
that<00:01:16.570> my<00:01:16.780> white<00:01:17.050> balance<00:01:17.470> is<00:01:17.620> set<00:01:18.010> to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
that my white balance is set to

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.280 
that my white balance is set to
automatic<00:01:18.700> now<00:01:19.390> if<00:01:19.510> you're<00:01:19.660> outdoors<00:01:20.050> that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
automatic now if you're outdoors that

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.840 
automatic now if you're outdoors that
should<00:01:20.470> be<00:01:20.590> fine<00:01:20.860> but<00:01:21.490> if<00:01:21.580> you're<00:01:21.730> in<00:01:21.790> a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
should be fine but if you're in a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.170 
should be fine but if you're in a
stadium<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.250> night<00:01:24.430> game<00:01:24.640> where<00:01:25.060> you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
stadium and it's a night game where you

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.420 
stadium and it's a night game where you
have<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.690> lights<00:01:25.990> on<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.620> may<00:01:26.770> not<00:01:26.950> be<00:01:27.010> as

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
have the lights on that may not be as

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.720 
have the lights on that may not be as
good<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.510> may<00:01:28.660> want<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.960> use<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.730> white

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
good and you may want to use a white

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.180 
good and you may want to use a white
balance<00:01:30.970> set<00:01:31.540> to<00:01:31.900> tungsten<00:01:32.260> or<00:01:32.620> fluorescent

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
in this mode is that the drive mode is

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.440 
in this mode is that the drive mode is
set<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.170> continuous<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.730> is<00:01:45.910> automatically

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
set to continuous this is automatically

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.940 
set to continuous this is automatically
set<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.720> continuous<00:01:47.230> for<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.710> what<00:01:47.830> this

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
set to continuous for you and what this

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.100 
set to continuous for you and what this
does<00:01:48.220> is<00:01:48.730> allow<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.360> press<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.960> shutter

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
does is allow you to press the shutter

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.370 
does is allow you to press the shutter
button<00:01:50.280> hold<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.490> button<00:01:51.790> down<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:52.330> as<00:01:53.080> long

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
button hold the button down and as long

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.140 
button hold the button down and as long
as<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.650> button<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.010> pressed<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.610> held<00:01:54.910> down

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
as the button is pressed and held down

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.060 
as the button is pressed and held down
the<00:01:55.390> camera<00:01:55.780> will<00:01:55.900> keep<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.290> taking<00:01:56.680> pictures

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
the camera will keep on taking pictures

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.120 
the camera will keep on taking pictures
so<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.240> good<00:01:58.480> if<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.140> want<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.680> capture

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130

an<00:03:55.910> outdoor<00:03:56.270> event<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:57.320> I'm<00:03:57.410> going<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.590> use

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
an outdoor event so I'm going to use

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.370 
an outdoor event so I'm going to use
daylight<00:03:58.160> if<00:03:58.489> it's<00:03:59.239> indoors<00:03:59.750> or<00:04:00.020> if<00:04:00.260> the

about<00:04:23.330> focusing<00:04:24.020> at<00:04:24.229> this

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
about focusing at this

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.960 
about focusing at this
and<00:04:25.750> you<00:04:26.750> can<00:04:26.930> see<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.560> with<00:04:27.889> one<00:04:28.250> 500th<00:04:28.819> of<00:04:28.880> a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.620 
and you can see that with one 500th of a
second<00:04:29.389> my<00:04:29.990> aperture<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.800> not<00:04:31.580> only<00:04:31.729> F<00:04:32.000> 2.8

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
second my aperture is not only F 2.8

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.839 
second my aperture is not only F 2.8
which<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.050> as<00:04:33.199> big<00:04:33.229> as<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.650> can<00:04:33.740> get<00:04:34.039> probably

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
which is as big as it can get probably

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.999 
which is as big as it can get probably
not<00:04:35.060> what<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.270> want<00:04:35.539> for<00:04:35.599> sports<00:04:36.050> because<00:04:36.889> this

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
not what I want for sports because this

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.710 
not what I want for sports because this
is<00:04:37.130> going<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.310> produce<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.669> very<00:04:37.880> shallow<00:04:38.389> depth

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
is going to produce a very shallow depth

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.110 
is going to produce a very shallow depth
of<00:04:38.810> field<00:04:38.870> but<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:39.620> also<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:39.979> red<00:04:40.220> when<00:04:40.970> it's

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
of field but it's also in red when it's

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.950 
of field but it's also in red when it's
in<00:04:41.270> red<00:04:41.449> it<00:04:41.690> means<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.490> my<00:04:43.539> shutter<00:04:44.539> speed<00:04:44.840> is

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
in red it means that my shutter speed is

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.050 
in red it means that my shutter speed is
too<00:04:45.169> fast<00:04:45.199> and<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.860> can't<00:04:46.099> compensate<00:04:46.520> enough

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
too fast and it can't compensate enough

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.110 
too fast and it can't compensate enough
for<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.229> proper<00:04:48.650> amount<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:48.919> light<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.940> way<00:04:50.090> I

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
for the proper amount of light the way I

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.650 
for the proper amount of light the way I
can<00:04:50.360> fix<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.199> by<00:04:51.380> increasing<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:52.220> ISO

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
can fix that is by increasing the ISO

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.360 
can fix that is by increasing the ISO
increasing<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.780> ISO<00:04:53.870> will<00:04:54.830> make<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.160> camera

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
increasing the ISO will make the camera

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.100 
increasing the ISO will make the camera
more<00:04:55.610> sensitive<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.509> available<00:04:56.930> light

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
more sensitive to the available light

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.089 
more sensitive to the available light
and<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.800> will<00:04:57.949> allow<00:04:58.159> me<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.520> have<00:04:58.819> a<00:05:00.099> smaller

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
and that will allow me to have a smaller

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.230 
and that will allow me to have a smaller
aperture<00:05:02.050> so<00:05:03.050> I'm<00:05:03.440> going<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.979> turn<00:05:04.310> my<00:05:04.759> ISO

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
aperture so I'm going to turn my ISO

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.140 
aperture so I'm going to turn my ISO
dial<00:05:05.919> I'll<00:05:06.919> increase<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:08.530> 400<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:10.150> I'll

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
dial I'll increase that to 400 and I'll

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.730 
dial I'll increase that to 400 and I'll
try<00:05:11.389> again<00:05:11.509> press<00:05:12.349> the<00:05:12.470> shutter<00:05:12.620> button

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
try again press the shutter button

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.870 
try again press the shutter button
halfway<00:05:13.539> now<00:05:14.539> I<00:05:14.569> see<00:05:14.840> that<00:05:14.870> my<00:05:15.020> aperture<00:05:15.560> is

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
halfway now I see that my aperture is

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.089 
halfway now I see that my aperture is
5.6<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:17.509> in<00:05:17.630> white<00:05:17.900> which<00:05:18.440> is<00:05:18.560> great<00:05:18.830> I

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
5.6 and it's in white which is great I

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.860 
5.6 and it's in white which is great I
know<00:05:19.370> my<00:05:19.610> exposure<00:05:20.060> is<00:05:20.240> going<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.479> be<00:05:20.569> just

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
know my exposure is going to be just

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.339 
know my exposure is going to be just
fine

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
fine

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.559 
fine
so<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.740> don't<00:05:21.860> need<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.430> increase<00:05:22.759> the<00:05:23.000> ISO<00:05:23.090> any

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
so I don't need to increase the ISO any

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.010 
so I don't need to increase the ISO any
more<00:05:23.750> than<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:25.120> now<00:05:26.120> for<00:05:26.599> taking<00:05:26.900> the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
more than that now for taking the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.189 
more than that now for taking the
