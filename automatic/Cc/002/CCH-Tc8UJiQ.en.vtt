this<00:04:35.580> before<00:04:35.759> but<00:04:36.509> puff<00:04:36.810> pastry<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.940> though

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
this before but puff pastry is though

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.339 
this before but puff pastry is though
that<00:04:38.970> has<00:04:39.810> been<00:04:40.940> rolled<00:04:41.940> out<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.629> folded<00:04:43.229> over

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
that has been rolled out and folded over

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.589 
that has been rolled out and folded over
hold<00:04:43.860> out<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:44.190> pulled<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.460> over<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:44.909> so

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
hold out and pulled it over it and so

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.710 
hold out and pulled it over it and so
that<00:04:46.440> creates<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.009> lot<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.310> layers<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.030> when<00:04:48.389> it

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
that creates a lot of layers so when it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.189 
that creates a lot of layers so when it
is<00:04:49.050> in<00:04:49.699> the<00:04:50.699> oven<00:04:50.789> it<00:04:51.090> puffs<00:04:51.330> up<00:04:51.539> and<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.020> think

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
is in the oven it puffs up and I think

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.839 
is in the oven it puffs up and I think
there's<00:04:52.379> also<00:04:52.530> butter<00:04:52.889> involved<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.729> all

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
there's also butter involved and all

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.499 
there's also butter involved and all
that<00:04:53.879> stuff<00:04:54.210> but<00:04:55.009> yep<00:04:56.009> so<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.490> hope<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.300> guys
