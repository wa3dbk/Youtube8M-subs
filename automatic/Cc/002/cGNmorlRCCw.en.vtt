00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
offense before I don't know I actually

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.440 
offense before I don't know I actually
had<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.800> sort<00:03:21.800> of<00:03:21.830> thing<00:03:21.980> on<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> one<00:03:22.370> game<00:03:22.640> by

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
had a sort of thing on the one game by

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.760 
had a sort of thing on the one game by
him<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:24.850> he's<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.880> he<00:03:26.660> got<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.870> size<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.440> he's

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
him but he's a he got a size and he's

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.070 
him but he's a he got a size and he's
young<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.610> think<00:03:29.120> eventually<00:03:29.540> he'll<00:03:29.930> be<00:03:30.050> a

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
young so I think eventually he'll be a

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:42.730 
young so I think eventually he'll be a
good<00:03:30.230> player<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:40.840> think<00:03:41.840> it's<00:03:41.990> great<00:03:42.170> for<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740
