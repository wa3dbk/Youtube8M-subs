00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
let's get this going this is the basic

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
let's get this going this is the basic
jig<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.880> really<00:00:25.210> nothing<00:00:25.630> fancy<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.860> use<00:00:27.130> a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
jig it's really nothing fancy you use a

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.019 
jig it's really nothing fancy you use a
straight<00:00:27.640> cutting<00:00:27.910> bit<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.740> cut<00:00:30.670> your<00:00:30.850> dowels

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
straight cutting bit to cut your dowels

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.240 
straight cutting bit to cut your dowels
and<00:00:31.359> then<00:00:32.079> you<00:00:32.320> have<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.890> block<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:35.680> each<00:00:35.829> size

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
and then you have a block for each size

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.419 
and then you have a block for each size
of<00:00:37.089> dowel<00:00:37.449> that<00:00:37.719> you<00:00:37.839> want<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.199> cut<00:00:38.469> with<00:00:39.309> an

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
rough stock and an exit hole that

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.719 
rough stock and an exit hole that
corresponds<00:00:44.769> with<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.979> finished<00:00:45.309> size<00:00:45.519> of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
corresponds with the finished size of

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.680 
corresponds with the finished size of
dowel<00:00:46.499> there's<00:00:47.499> also<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.889> bottom<00:00:48.249> hole<00:00:49.120> here

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
dowel there's also a bottom hole here

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.299 
dowel there's also a bottom hole here
that<00:00:50.219> aligns<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:52.510> your<00:00:52.629> bit<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:54.039> I'm<00:00:54.159> gonna

to show clarity for the video normally

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.430 
to show clarity for the video normally
when<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.430> dowel<00:01:49.000> exits<00:01:49.450> out<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.659> exit<00:01:50.170> port

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
when the dowel exits out the exit port

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.649 
when the dowel exits out the exit port
it'll<00:01:51.220> just<00:01:51.430> go<00:01:51.580> right<00:01:51.790> into<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.420> hose

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
it'll just go right into the hose

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
into how that can be it just works

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.700 
into how that can be it just works
you<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.420> see<00:01:58.659> here<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.200> I've<00:01:59.320> got<00:01:59.350> some
