this<00:00:12.210> week<00:00:12.450> we're<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.170> talking

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
this week we're going to be talking

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.660 
this week we're going to be talking
about<00:00:13.560> strength<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.520> structure<00:00:15.619> so

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
about strength that structure so

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.800 
about strength that structure so
everybody<00:00:17.670> must<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.570> strong<00:00:18.869> stuff

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
everybody must be the strong stuff

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.420 
everybody must be the strong stuff
try

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.380 

yeah<00:00:27.410> okay<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.190> two<00:00:29.790> cubes<00:00:30.150> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
yeah okay so here we have two cubes that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
yeah okay so here we have two cubes that
are<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.600> wireframe<00:00:30.890> it's<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.010> one<00:00:32.190> millimeter

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
are a wireframe it's a one millimeter

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.300 
are a wireframe it's a one millimeter
wire<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> way<00:00:33.390> around<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.040> one<00:00:35.040> has

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
wire all the way around and one has

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.630 
wire all the way around and one has
triangles<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.500> other<00:00:37.650> one<00:00:37.860> has

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
triangles in it and the other one has

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.810 
triangles in it and the other one has
squares<00:00:39.060> and<00:00:39.800> i'm<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> show<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.190> what

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
squares and i'm going to show you what

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.020 
squares and i'm going to show you what
the<00:00:42.150> difference<00:00:42.540> between<00:00:42.809> these<00:00:43.140> two<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:44.030> here

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the difference between these two is here

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.320 
the difference between these two is here
we<00:00:45.150> have<00:00:45.300> our<00:00:45.570> incredibly<00:00:46.230> scientific<00:00:47.330> weight

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
we have our incredibly scientific weight

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.299 
we have our incredibly scientific weight
that<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.920> test<00:00:50.130> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that we are going to use to test the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.620 
that we are going to use to test the
strength<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> q

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
strength of this q

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.070 
strength of this q
so<00:00:52.810> wait<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:53.920> Diet<00:00:54.190> Coke<00:00:54.490> lighter<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.840> can<00:00:56.050> it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
so wait is Diet Coke lighter just can it

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.410 
so wait is Diet Coke lighter just can it
be<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.840> we're<00:00:59.230> going<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.500> very<00:00:59.920> gently<00:01:00.420> place

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
be so we're going to very gently place

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.130 
be so we're going to very gently place
it<00:01:01.500> whoa<00:01:04.020> okay<00:01:05.020> that<00:01:05.230> lost<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.770> two<00:01:06.160> seconds

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it whoa okay that lost it two seconds

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.590 
it whoa okay that lost it two seconds
here<00:01:08.140> we<00:01:08.230> have<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.530> triangles<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:10.180> more<00:01:10.420> try

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
here we have the triangles one more try

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.230 
here we have the triangles one more try
same<00:01:11.380> co<00:01:11.620> can<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:14.680> scan<00:01:15.190> Huck<00:01:15.490> so<00:01:15.880> he<00:01:16.030> sure

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
same co can now scan Huck so he sure

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.950 
same co can now scan Huck so he sure
he's<00:01:16.390> not<00:01:16.570> holding<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:17.050> dr.<00:01:17.920> dirt<00:01:18.960> triangles

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
he's not holding it dr. dirt triangles

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.860 
he's not holding it dr. dirt triangles
for<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.380> win<00:01:20.620> let's<00:01:21.580> look<00:01:21.790> at<00:01:22.060> how<00:01:22.270> much<00:01:22.630> it's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
for the win let's look at how much it's

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.130 
for the win let's look at how much it's
bending<00:01:23.380> there<00:01:23.620> wait<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.790> bit<00:01:25.119> quite<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:25.510> bit<00:01:25.630> all

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
bending there wait a bit quite a bit all

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.440 
bending there wait a bit quite a bit all
right<00:01:26.290> that's<00:01:26.560> one<00:01:26.860> cut<00:01:27.190> can<00:01:27.490> are<00:01:28.150> we<00:01:28.300> going<00:01:28.390> to

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
right that's one cut can are we going to

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.620 
right that's one cut can are we going to
put<00:01:28.570> another<00:01:28.690> one<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.670> more<00:01:30.940> there<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.540> is

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
put another one on one more there it is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.180 
put another one on one more there it is
in<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.900> background<00:01:32.110> I'm<00:01:32.530> just<00:01:32.740> gonna<00:01:32.860> focus

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
in the background I'm just gonna focus

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.460 
in the background I'm just gonna focus
in<00:01:33.550> on<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:38.550> all<00:01:39.550> right<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:41.020> only<00:01:41.200> did<00:01:41.440> it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
in on this all right not only did it

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.730 
in on this all right not only did it
break<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:41.970> disintegrated<00:01:43.350> let's<00:01:44.350> see<00:01:44.560> what's

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
break it disintegrated let's see what's

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.190 
break it disintegrated let's see what's
under<00:01:45.009> there<00:01:45.190> whoa<00:01:45.640> it's<00:01:46.210> from<00:01:46.540> back<00:01:46.750> but<00:01:47.080> it

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
under there whoa it's from back but it

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.700 
under there whoa it's from back but it
did<00:01:47.350> bring<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.950> definitely<00:01:48.430> did<00:01:48.640> break<00:01:48.910> yep

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
did bring it definitely did break yep

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.499 
did bring it definitely did break yep
but<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.800> took<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.250> cook<00:01:51.520> em<00:01:51.759> so<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.270> means

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
but it took to cook em so that means

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.820 
but it took to cook em so that means
it's<00:01:52.900> scientifically<00:01:53.440> twice<00:01:54.250> as<00:01:54.610> strong<00:01:55.830> so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
it's scientifically twice as strong so

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.100 
it's scientifically twice as strong so
we<00:01:57.100> just<00:01:57.340> learned<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:57.729> adding<00:01:58.660> those<00:01:58.810> few

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
we just learned that adding those few

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.870 
we just learned that adding those few
extra<00:01:59.440> strokes<00:01:59.710> can<00:01:59.979> make<00:02:00.220> things<00:02:00.460> stronger

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
extra strokes can make things stronger

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.559 
extra strokes can make things stronger
yes<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.780> best<00:02:04.929> part<00:02:05.050> is<00:02:06.179> this<00:02:07.179> one<00:02:07.420> in

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
yes and the best part is this one in

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:08.660 
yes and the best part is this one in
this<00:02:07.720> one

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
this one

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.480 
this one
fifteen<00:02:09.240> cents<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.599> fair<00:02:09.750> price<00:02:10.020> whoa<00:02:10.679> so

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
fifteen cents a fair price whoa so

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.089 
fifteen cents a fair price whoa so
adding<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:12.090> those<00:02:12.270> extra<00:02:12.690> lines<00:02:13.080> makes<00:02:13.860> it

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
adding all those extra lines makes it

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.190 
adding all those extra lines makes it
twice<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.400> strong<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:15.209> only<00:02:15.330> fifteen<00:02:15.840> cents

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
twice as strong for only fifteen cents

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.660 
twice as strong for only fifteen cents
that's<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.980> Wow<00:02:18.470> okay<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.489> see

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that's it Wow okay so as you can see

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.010 
that's it Wow okay so as you can see
from<00:02:21.080> triangle<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.280> extremely<00:02:23.280> scientific

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
from triangle and extremely scientific

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.790 
from triangle and extremely scientific
experiments<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.350> how<00:02:25.590> much

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
experiments you can see how much

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.160 
experiments you can see how much
stronger<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:27.120> adding<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> triangle<00:02:27.959> sense

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
stronger just adding the triangle sense

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.160 
stronger just adding the triangle sense
well<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.520> any<00:02:29.700> more<00:02:29.880> questions
