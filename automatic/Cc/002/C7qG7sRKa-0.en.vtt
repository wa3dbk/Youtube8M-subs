00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.340
 among all the next gen titles one of the most 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.020
 interesting in absolute terms without shadow 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.119
 of doubt the latest work by 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.349
 eat and ambitious huge and gives 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.119
 the impression of being able to blend to the fullest 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.829
 of the items that made the headlines 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.930
 of the previous generation of the true 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.579
 classics is a shooter but a look 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.110
 complex system similar to that of 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.149
 borderlands with a development system 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.770
 dual that is based both on weapons and 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.450
 on the abilities of the characters and it seems 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.309
 offer great freedom to the player a 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.230
 boundless world to explore and a 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.730
 use of 1600 solitude in 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.650
 cooperative but above all in 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.150
 there was a cooperative at the games week 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.070
 developers so we couldn't 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.210
 sure let us miss the chance to make us 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.980
 a chat 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.810
 we talked to eric osborne the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.530
 community home manager 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.530
 this is what he told us 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 leo games in sound destinies looks like one 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.080
 of the most promising games of the new 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.850
 generation has a remarkable look it seems 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.350
 really complex in particular me 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.480
 very intrigues the system of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 double linked development is the skills of the 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.840
 characters that has an internal system of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.130
 upgrade weapons with skill 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.900
 specifications for each guns 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.490
 you can elaborate a you can explain me better 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.750
 how it all works 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.190
 you have then had some problems with 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.300
 balancing with such a number of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.300
 factors to consider 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.500
 we play every day to be 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.960
 sure that everything is fine 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.270
 balanced is a super important factor 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.280
 for us it is superficially a title 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.660
 simple to play appreciate but more 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 go to the bottom and start leveling up 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.920
 and more new ones are introduced to you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.259
 skill new weapons movement skills 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.940
 and equipment everything is explained 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.530
 in an understandable way to allow the 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.330
 player to understand the depth and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.729
 complexity of the chosen character 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.560
 in short, for her game we wanted to have a 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.880
 lot of people with a differentiated look 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.890
 and also from the style of play 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.600
 differentiated only in his to have will be 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.039
 a very cooperative but also experience 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.750
 playable in singles as much as you are 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.460
 concentrate on the element co op 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.780
 the campaign is calculated to be a lot 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.800
 more enjoyable in the company or is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.870
 equally enjoyable by ourselves we have one 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.760
 philosophy that recites everything you do 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.740
 it's more fun made with friends 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.569
 we know the multiplayer titles there 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.460
 we have been working for a very long time 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.810
 you can also go and see before aloe 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.209
 find a lot of titles from us 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.260
 built as collective experiences 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.000
 we love this kind of thing 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.770
 let's go see the people who collaborate 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.330
 and you pass the time great you can 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.160
 play alone in destiny have moments 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.590
 private but meet other players 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.030
 at the crossroads we will have public spaces in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.830
 which you will see other users 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.050
 but during the cinematics the choice 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.580
 If you want to enjoy a story, enjoy yourself 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.680
 a movie will not place the others 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.750
 players to ruin you there because you could 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.550
 don't have fun so we want you to 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.650
 choose whether to form a party and turn 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.330
 with friends but still we want 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.370
 be sure that everything is fun 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.500
 to play and that it is even more so with 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.959
 therefore there are many friends 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.480
 cooperative elements in the game only 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.099
 read the creation you created a 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.840
 new world is not some work recently 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.360
 what inspired you in this process 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.140
 books science fiction movies comics 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.380
 something in particular 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.120
 well spies wenders there are tons of 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.980
 things that offer inspiration during the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.630
 development of such a world yes 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.400
 speaks of hundreds of people who 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.790
 work on the same project for various 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.380
 years 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.209
 so yes we read a lot of 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.190
 science fiction and we see a lot of films 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.990
 we are fans of game of thrones is the wire 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.970
 just name something and you will find 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.500
 someone in the studios who is a fan you can 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.030
 see even influences from the souls 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.440
 in the artistic style 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.790
 there is even a hint of thunder and the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.320
 barbarian in art style 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.360
 the challenge is not to draw 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.560
 inspiration from certain elements but 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.150
 in merging the many sources of 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.370
 inspiration so as to achieve a 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.690
 original and unique feeling is a work of 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.730
 desks and we want to leave ours 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.410
 clear mark on the finished product in 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.739
 so that a player is aware of 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.510
 how unique it is ours and speaking of 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.640
 game of thrones we should expect of 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.030
 drama between the various factions intrigues and 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.030
 similar stuff 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.739
 well we have competitive multiplayer not 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.630
 we still talked about photos of 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.610
 group system but at the moment it can be 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.720
 go to bungie.net and form a group 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.070
 if desired 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.540
 however we cannot yet 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.109
 learn more about the system 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.310
 faction of the game you will talk about it shortly 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.190
 absolutely in the future we will talk about it 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 the multiplayer was a compact car 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.340
 back on the competitive multiplayer 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.020
 you will aim for a balance at the height 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.220
 of sports you want to add it 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.260
 mainly as a pastime 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.290
 fun to behold the complexity 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.780
 of the system mainly the game must 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.640
 be fun you have to want but to play 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.440
 the sport or not we are 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.120
 absolutely competitive players 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.040
 we keep back to the weekly to which 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.750
 we participate and we have many skilled people 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.190
 players in the studio but we are 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.690
 concentrating to make the game 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.000
 fun at all skill levels 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.470
 for us it is very important that the title 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.270
 both enjoyable and for those with time 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.010
 play a half hour a week for that 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.990
 who wants to spend each night there 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.160
 explore each complex element e 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.390
 live thoroughly in multiplayer 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.530
 competitive every night with you 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.300
 moved from the gameplay point of view 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.310
 you bet on a very system 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.440
 intuitive the so-called faces from 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.850
 learn but difficult to master either 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.740
 you want to offer a plethora of immediately 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.890
 mechanical and absorb gradually 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.539
 player 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.919
 both actually every game tries to 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.360
 starting accessible way later 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.320
 become deeper rich with the 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.520
 spend some time 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.680
 here it starts easily and 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.690
 and a character and the world opens man 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.610
 hand that advances and then culminates with 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.379
 something like a raid where you are 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.970
 in the company of six very good friends 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.340
 to overcome an incredibly challenge 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.020
 difficult this kind of thing is 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.879
 designed to be appreciated to the limit 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.289
 maximum of the title and force a 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.270
 think carefully about the equipment 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.460
 to be used in the combination of 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.650
 power class and every movement because 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.300
 every movement matters in these phases 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.710
 we want to be sure to balance between 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.180
 funny moments where you can 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.280
 simply turn off the brain and 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.800
 deep tactical phases that 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.629
 require plans and great skill 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.699
 hello hello I'll ask you a question that 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.349
 many will have already done it but you know that 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.120
 there is considerable attention around the 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.879
 I play the real part of the community PC 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.470
 absolutely the are the community manager 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.220
 therefore I constantly check that 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.229
 kind of feed 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.050
 we currently have no announcements to make to 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.190
 respect but we listen to people then 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.599
 you wo n't tell me anything about 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.340
 a possible pc version 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:18.690
 we go out on four platforms and not 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.849
 we have other announcements to make 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.229
 we are simply concentrating for 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.669
 make the game as good as possible on 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.930
 those platforms 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.639
 there is much work to be done we must 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.419
 make sure those versions are 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:36.199
 absolutely perfect a man always 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.199
 dreaming 6 1 masha what a value
