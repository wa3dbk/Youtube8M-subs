noticed<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.579> i<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:48.000> open<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> from<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
noticed that i did open it from the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.170 
noticed that i did open it from the
bottom<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.430> flap<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:51.060> in

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
bottom that was because this flap was in

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.219 
bottom that was because this flap was in
the<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.540> i<00:01:51.600> didn't<00:01:51.810> want<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.110> around

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the way and i didn't want to go around

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.929 
the way and i didn't want to go around
the<00:01:52.530> flap<00:01:52.770> i<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.250> trying<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> keep<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.759> in

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the flap i was trying to keep this in

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.480 
the flap i was trying to keep this in
mint<00:01:54.180> shape<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.649> one<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> did<00:01:56.310> was

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
mint shape so this one what I did was

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.069 
mint shape so this one what I did was
I've<00:01:56.759> been<00:01:56.790> opening<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.329> from<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> top<00:01:57.840> again

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
I've been opening it from the top again

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.289 
I've been opening it from the top again
I've<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.469> been<00:01:58.799> using<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.340> butter<00:01:59.759> knife<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I've just been using my butter knife and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.200 
I've just been using my butter knife and
I've<00:02:00.630> been<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.799> very<00:02:02.159> slowly<00:02:02.790> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I've been going in very very slowly so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.840 
I've been going in very very slowly so
let's<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.829> wiggle<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.460> open

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
let's just see if I can wiggle this open

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.410 
let's just see if I can wiggle this open
all<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> way<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.079> quite<00:02:07.890> carefully<00:02:08.459> so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that I don't damage anything like this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
that I don't damage anything like this
and<00:02:11.610> US<00:02:11.790> collectors<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.170> keep

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and US collectors we want to keep

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.880 
and US collectors we want to keep
everything<00:02:13.530> in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
everything in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.640 
everything in
good<00:02:14.220> shape<00:02:14.819> hopefully<00:02:15.630> I've<00:02:15.810> wedged<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.440> up

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
good shape hopefully I've wedged that up

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.220 
good shape hopefully I've wedged that up
enough<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.610> will<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:17.940> see<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:19.080> this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
enough we will just see if I can do this

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.100 
enough we will just see if I can do this
there<00:02:20.220> we<00:02:20.340> go<00:02:20.459> perfect<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.660> box<00:02:21.930> is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
there we go perfect so now the box is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
there we go perfect so now the box is
cracked<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.770> no<00:02:23.190> longer<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.670> brand<00:02:24.000> new<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.209> did

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
cracked it's no longer a brand new I did

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.699 
cracked it's no longer a brand new I did
that<00:02:24.630> pretty<00:02:24.870> well<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.410> really<00:02:25.560> good

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that pretty well so that's a really good

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.290 
that pretty well so that's a really good
way<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.890> doing<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.310> actually<00:02:26.640> from<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.090> top

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
way of doing it actually from the top

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.210 
way of doing it actually from the top
worked<00:02:27.540> really<00:02:27.810> well<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.230> then<00:02:28.590> BAM<00:02:28.890> right

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
worked really well and then BAM right

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.770 
worked really well and then BAM right
away<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.580> time<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.060> those<00:02:30.240> Maxwell

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
away this time we have those Maxwell

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.590 
away this time we have those Maxwell
batteries<00:02:31.380> first<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.700> foremost<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.420> let's

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
batteries first and foremost so let's

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.030 
batteries first and foremost so let's
move<00:02:34.140> those<00:02:34.380> aside<00:02:35.780> batteries<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.920> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
move those aside batteries out this is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.260 
move those aside batteries out this is
obviously<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.459> way<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.640> was<00:02:38.760> supposed<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.150> be

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
obviously the way it was supposed to be

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.930 
obviously the way it was supposed to be
opened<00:02:39.800> not<00:02:40.800> from<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> bottom

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
opened not from the bottom

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.390 
opened not from the bottom

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the a buttons obviously green the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.350 
the a buttons obviously green the
buttons<00:03:29.100> are<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.340> yellow<00:03:29.489> obviously<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> think

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
buttons are in yellow obviously I think

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.770 
buttons are in yellow obviously I think
to<00:03:30.660> match<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.110> buttons<00:03:31.980> actually<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> Luigi

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
to match the buttons actually on a Luigi

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.370 
to match the buttons actually on a Luigi
and<00:03:33.959> then<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.160> massive<00:03:35.820> L<00:03:36.030> looks<00:03:36.570> spectacular

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
and then the massive L looks spectacular

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.410 
and then the massive L looks spectacular
the<00:03:38.010> home<00:03:38.220> button<00:03:38.549> obviously<00:03:38.910> again<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.239> blue

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
the home button obviously again is blue

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.270 
the home button obviously again is blue
and<00:03:39.540> green<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.320> one<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.620> two<00:03:40.769> buttons<00:03:41.070> are

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
and green the one and two buttons are

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.190 
and green the one and two buttons are
that<00:03:41.489> burnt<00:03:41.940> red<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.540> kind<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.959> looked<00:03:43.140> like

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
that burnt red that kind of looked like

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.289 
that burnt red that kind of looked like
they're<00:03:43.470> exactly<00:03:44.010> like<00:03:44.190> Luigi's<00:03:44.880> shoes

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
they're exactly like Luigi's shoes

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.630 
they're exactly like Luigi's shoes
hopefully<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.350> case<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.459> back

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
hopefully that is the case and the back

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.420 
hopefully that is the case and the back
B<00:03:47.880> button<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.299> also<00:03:48.660> red<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.829> coolest<00:03:50.160> part<00:03:50.340> of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
B button is also red the coolest part of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.100 
B button is also red the coolest part of
the<00:03:50.489> controller<00:03:50.880> about<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.540> controller<00:03:51.900> is

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the controller about the controller is

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.650 
the controller about the controller is
the<00:03:52.500> L<00:03:52.650> insignia<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.850> see<00:03:54.090> here<00:03:54.450> and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
the L insignia that you see here and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.530 
the L insignia that you see here and
obviously<00:03:55.650> there<00:03:55.799> is<00:03:55.890> Wii<00:03:56.010> MotionPlus<00:03:56.400> inside

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
obviously there is Wii MotionPlus inside

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.420 
obviously there is Wii MotionPlus inside
I<00:03:57.570> did<00:03:58.079> mention<00:03:58.290> with<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.680> Mario<00:03:59.010> controller

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
I did mention with the Mario controller

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.250 
I did mention with the Mario controller
so<00:03:59.610> this<00:03:59.700> wouldn't<00:03:59.970> be<00:04:00.060> new<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.420> this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
so this wouldn't be new to you this

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.840 
so this wouldn't be new to you this
controller<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.040> Luigi<00:04:02.370> one<00:04:02.519> was<00:04:02.700> actually

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
controller the Luigi one was actually

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.880 
controller the Luigi one was actually
modeled<00:04:03.329> after<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.810> Gamecube<00:04:04.440> Luigi

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
modeled after the Gamecube Luigi

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.340 
modeled after the Gamecube Luigi
controller<00:04:05.430> which<00:04:06.209> came<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:06.750> box<00:04:07.079> only

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
controller which came in this box only

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.110 
controller which came in this box only
in<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:07.829> box<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.310> was<00:04:08.400> released<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:08.790> Japan

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
in this box that was released in Japan

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.699 
in this box that was released in Japan
through<00:04:09.420> Club<00:04:09.750> Nintendo<00:04:09.959> says<00:04:10.530> right<00:04:10.680> there

through Club Nintendo says right there

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.470 
through Club Nintendo says right there
at<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:10.980> top<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.850> controller<00:04:12.239> looks

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
at the top and that controller looks

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.930 
at the top and that controller looks
something<00:04:12.840> like<00:04:13.019> this<00:04:13.560> one<00:04:13.799> right<00:04:14.010> here<00:04:14.519> so

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
something like this one right here so

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.550 
something like this one right here so
you<00:04:15.030> see<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.420> L<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.049> GameCube

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
you see that L on the GameCube

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.409 
you see that L on the GameCube
controller<00:04:16.919> was<00:04:17.190> also<00:04:17.519> put<00:04:17.729> on<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.209> Wii

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
controller was also put on the Wii

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.909 
controller was also put on the Wii
controller<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.049> I'm<00:04:19.140> not<00:04:19.320> complaining<00:04:19.829> it

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
controller and I'm not complaining it

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.590 
controller and I'm not complaining it
was<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.070> great<00:04:20.430> design<00:04:20.760> I'm<00:04:20.970> really<00:04:21.180> happy<00:04:21.359> they

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
was a great design I'm really happy they

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.140 
was a great design I'm really happy they
did<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.500> looks<00:04:22.830> fantastic<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:23.700> having

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
did do this it looks fantastic so having

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.120 
did do this it looks fantastic so having
this<00:04:24.360> pair<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.840> match<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.410> think<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:25.950> really

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
this pair to match I think is really

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.350 
this pair to match I think is really
cool<00:04:26.460> the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
cool the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.230 
cool the
is<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.780> deep<00:04:28.259> shade<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.979> blue<00:04:29.250> it's<00:04:29.460> very<00:04:29.849> dark

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
is a deep shade of blue it's very dark

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.020 
is a deep shade of blue it's very dark
Jean<00:04:30.599> Grae<00:04:30.900> if<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.500> compare<00:04:31.889> it<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.159> the<00:04:32.460> Mario

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
Jean Grae if you compare it to the Mario

Jean Grae if you compare it to the Mario
controller<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.810> just<00:04:34.110> got<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.560> did<00:04:35.009> put

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
controller that I just got I did put

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.909 
controller that I just got I did put
this<00:04:35.400> back<00:04:35.759> in<00:04:36.060> its<00:04:36.240> casing<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.560> let<00:04:37.680> me<00:04:37.770> just

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
this back in its casing so let me just

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.529 
this back in its casing so let me just
rip<00:04:38.159> this<00:04:38.310> out<00:04:38.490> really<00:04:38.759> quickly<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.270> show<00:04:39.300> you

different<00:04:42.300> Nintendo<00:04:42.870> did<00:04:43.080> take<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.409> time

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
different Nintendo did take the time

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.950 
different Nintendo did take the time
because<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.460> genes<00:04:44.759> that<00:04:44.909> Luigi<00:04:45.509> wear<00:04:45.689> and

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
because the genes that Luigi wear and

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.510 
because the genes that Luigi wear and
the<00:04:46.050> genes<00:04:46.289> that<00:04:46.349> Mario<00:04:46.710> wear<00:04:46.889> are<00:04:47.069> apparently

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the genes that Mario wear are apparently

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.010 
the genes that Mario wear are apparently
different<00:04:47.699> genes<00:04:48.090> even<00:04:48.569> though<00:04:48.840> they're

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
different genes even though they're

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.629 
different genes even though they're
brothers<00:04:49.349> apparently<00:04:49.889> they're<00:04:50.009> not<00:04:50.039> handy

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
brothers apparently they're not handy

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.140 
brothers apparently they're not handy
downs<00:04:51.319> so<00:04:52.319> this<00:04:52.469> controller<00:04:52.889> it's<00:04:53.159> $40<00:04:53.909> it

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150
