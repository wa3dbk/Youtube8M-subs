compass and GPS unit off of everything I
figured<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.200> know<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:22.470> I'll<00:00:22.650> tear<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> down

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
the inside and maybe talk a little bit

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.380 
the inside and maybe talk a little bit
about<00:00:27.570> how<00:00:28.290> that<00:00:28.350> affects<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.850> frequency

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
about how that affects the frequency

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
about how that affects the frequency
choices<00:00:31.020> that<00:00:31.200> you<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.460> for<00:00:32.460> your<00:00:32.640> video<00:00:32.790> now

it<00:00:33.510> uses<00:00:33.899> these<00:00:34.430> specialty<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.990> believe<00:00:36.990> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it uses these specialty I believe that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.520 
it uses these specialty I believe that
they're<00:00:37.410> pentalobe<00:00:38.340> screws<00:00:39.440> they're<00:00:40.440> either

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
they're pentalobe screws they're either

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.870 
they're pentalobe screws they're either
the<00:00:40.650> either<00:00:41.070> their<00:00:41.310> pedal<00:00:41.610> over<00:00:41.880> there<00:00:42.030> Torx

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
the either their pedal over there Torx

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.160 
the either their pedal over there Torx
figure<00:00:44.880> it<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.720> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:45.900> too

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
figure it out that one was a little too

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:57.700 
figure it out that one was a little too
small<00:00:46.380> let's<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.590 

let's<00:00:58.250> go<00:00:58.400> to<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:58.640> one<00:01:02.080> no<00:01:03.080> too<00:01:03.260> big<00:01:04.600> all

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
let's go to this one no too big all

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.360 
let's go to this one no too big all
right<00:01:05.660> so<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.080> turns<00:01:06.350> out<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.100> screws

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
right so it turns out that the screws

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.780 
right so it turns out that the screws
that<00:01:07.460> they<00:01:07.520> use<00:01:07.760> on<00:01:07.940> here<00:01:08.240> are<00:01:09.010> t4<00:01:10.010> Torx<00:01:10.460> and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
that they use on here are t4 Torx and

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.930 
that they use on here are t4 Torx and
I'm<00:01:11.780> just<00:01:11.930> using<00:01:12.080> this<00:01:12.320> little<00:01:12.590> security<00:01:13.580> bit

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
I'm just using this little security bit

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.090 
I'm just using this little security bit
set<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.420> got<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.690> Amazon<00:01:14.860> so<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:15.979> pretty

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
GPS receiver this here's a backup

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.949 
GPS receiver this here's a backup
battery<00:02:15.629> I<00:02:15.900> believe<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:18.510> they're

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
battery I believe this I think they're

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.559 
battery I believe this I think they're
using<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.290> entire<00:02:19.709> back<00:02:20.099> plate<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
using the entire back plate it's like a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.559 
using the entire back plate it's like a
patch<00:02:21.930> antenna<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.769> what<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.040> looks<00:02:23.190> like

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
patch antenna that's what it looks like

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.039 
patch antenna that's what it looks like
see<00:02:24.569> if<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.930> flip<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.290> over<00:02:25.470> put<00:02:26.840> out<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
see if I can flip it over put out and

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.449 
see if I can flip it over put out and
take<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> look<00:02:28.410> at<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:30.769> yeah<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.799> don't<00:02:32.099> think<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
take a look at it yeah I don't think I

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.690 
take a look at it yeah I don't think I
should<00:02:32.640> do<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.140> adhered<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.290> this

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
should do that it's adhered in this

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.589 
should do that it's adhered in this
thing<00:02:35.700> right<00:02:35.910> here<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.450> setup<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.349> believe<00:02:37.829> is

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
thing right here this setup I believe is

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.120 
thing right here this setup I believe is
part<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.810> magnetometer<00:02:40.709> actually

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
part of the magnetometer actually

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.440 
part of the magnetometer actually
because<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.640> little<00:02:41.760> secondary<00:02:42.420> board

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
because it's a little secondary board

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.330 
because it's a little secondary board
now<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:46.380> thing<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:46.860> did<00:02:47.099> notice

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
now the one thing that I did notice

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.640 
now the one thing that I did notice
about<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.150> there's<00:02:48.390> no<00:02:48.450> saw<00:02:48.989> filter<00:02:49.470> in

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
about this is there's no saw filter in

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.920 
about this is there's no saw filter in
here<00:02:50.150> that's<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.269> be<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.480> pretty<00:02:51.660> serious

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
here that's gonna be a pretty serious

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.460 
here that's gonna be a pretty serious
problem<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.579> guys<00:02:53.760> using<00:02:54.140> 1.3<00:02:55.140> gigahertz

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
problem for you guys using 1.3 gigahertz

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.300 
problem for you guys using 1.3 gigahertz
for<00:02:55.829> your<00:02:55.980> video<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:57.079> GPS<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.680> 1.5

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
for your video because GPS is on 1.5

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000 
for your video because GPS is on 1.5
gigahertz<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.510> you're<00:03:00.720> very<00:03:00.959> likely<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.590> swap

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
gigahertz so you're very likely to swap

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.660 
gigahertz so you're very likely to swap
out<00:03:02.569> your<00:03:03.569> GPS<00:03:04.019> receiver<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:04.769> you're<00:03:05.010> like<00:03:05.489> me

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
out your GPS receiver if you're like me

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.039 
out your GPS receiver if you're like me
and<00:03:05.849> you're<00:03:05.940> running<00:03:06.209> something<00:03:06.480> ridiculous

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
and you're running something ridiculous

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.229 
and you're running something ridiculous
like<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.260> watt<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.769> half<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> recommend

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
like a watt and a half so I recommend

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.729 
like a watt and a half so I recommend
that<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.359> guys<00:03:09.510> usually<00:03:09.930> use<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> low-pass

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
that you guys usually use a low-pass

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.180 
that you guys usually use a low-pass
filter<00:03:10.769> or<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> nosh<00:03:11.760> filter<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:13.200> your<00:03:13.260> VTX

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
filter or a nosh filter on your VTX

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.610 
filter or a nosh filter on your VTX
to<00:03:14.549> prevent<00:03:15.150> interference<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:16.350> your<00:03:16.500> nozzle

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to prevent interference with your nozzle

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.699 
to prevent interference with your nozzle
GPS<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.900> said<00:03:19.079> it's<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.260> very<00:03:19.470> simple

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
GPS but like I said it's a very simple

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.860 
GPS but like I said it's a very simple
design<00:03:19.980> there's<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> lot<00:03:21.269> going<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.660> in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
design there's not a lot going on in

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.150 
design there's not a lot going on in
there<00:03:22.049> if<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.290> were<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.590> I'd<00:03:22.739> put<00:03:22.950> another

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
there if I were you I'd put another

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.330 
there if I were you I'd put another
little<00:03:23.459> drop<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:24.560> canopy<00:03:25.560> glue<00:03:25.799> or<00:03:26.010> something

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
little drop of canopy glue or something

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.039 
little drop of canopy glue or something
in<00:03:26.459> there<00:03:26.609> to<00:03:26.730> protect<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.180> wires<00:03:27.420> but<00:03:27.840> you

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
in there to protect the wires but you

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.210 
in there to protect the wires but you
know<00:03:28.139> that's<00:03:28.260> all<00:03:28.470> there<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.950> it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
know that's all there is to it

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.360 
know that's all there is to it
and<00:03:29.340> these<00:03:30.060> are<00:03:30.209> all<00:03:30.329> SMD<00:03:31.190> components<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.250> they

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and these are all SMD components so they

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.659 
and these are all SMD components so they
should<00:03:32.549> be<00:03:32.700> actually<00:03:32.880> very<00:03:33.329> very<00:03:34.220> easy<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
should be actually very very easy to

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.430 
should be actually very very easy to
service<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.329> guys<00:03:36.419> have<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> reflow

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
service if you guys have like a reflow

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.250 
service if you guys have like a reflow
gun<00:03:37.709> or<00:03:37.919> a<00:03:37.950> really<00:03:38.099> small<00:03:38.220> tip<00:03:38.700> iron<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.810> this

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
gun or a really small tip iron but this

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.379 
gun or a really small tip iron but this
whole<00:03:40.440> thing<00:03:40.709> because<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.519> v2<00:03:41.819> came<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.209> is

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
whole thing because the v2 came out is

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.009 
whole thing because the v2 came out is
now<00:03:43.130> ridiculously<00:03:44.130> inexpensive<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:45.930> you

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
now ridiculously inexpensive so if you

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.559
