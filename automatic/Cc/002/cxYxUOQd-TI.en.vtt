separate<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> 8<00:01:24.960> by<00:01:25.200> 10<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:26.009> save<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> from

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
separate it 8 by 10 you save it from

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
separate it 8 by 10 you save it from
separation<00:01:26.970> studio<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.720> 8<00:01:27.810> by<00:01:27.930> 10<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.350> then

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
separation studio as an 8 by 10 and then

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
separation studio as an 8 by 10 and then
you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.920> import<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> into<00:01:29.400> CorelDraw<00:01:29.970> with

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you can import it into CorelDraw with

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
you can import it into CorelDraw with
that<00:01:30.780> production<00:01:31.110> file<00:01:31.409> size<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.770> mine<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
that production file size of mine so you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
that production file size of mine so you
just<00:01:32.369> left<00:01:32.549> mouse<00:01:32.759> click<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
just left mouse click but I do want to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.300 
just left mouse click but I do want to
point<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.290> let's<00:01:34.470> say<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> huge<00:01:35.100> file

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
point out let's say we have a huge file

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.609 
point out let's say we have a huge file
too<00:01:35.520> large<00:01:35.700> maybe<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:36.960> 8<00:01:37.200> by<00:01:37.350> 10

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
too large maybe it's a you know 8 by 10

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
too large maybe it's a you know 8 by 10
but<00:01:37.740> we're<00:01:37.860> gonna<00:01:37.950> print<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.400> maybe<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but we're gonna print it maybe on the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.490 
but we're gonna print it maybe on the
front<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.509> garment<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.170> smaller

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
front of a garment it's gonna be smaller

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
front of a garment it's gonna be smaller
so<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.250> left<00:01:41.610> mouse<00:01:41.759> click<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.479> drag

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
so I can left mouse click and I can drag

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.560 
so I can left mouse click and I can drag
and<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.740> actually<00:01:43.979> resize<00:01:44.579> using<00:01:45.450> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and I can actually resize using this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.880 
and I can actually resize using this
dialog<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.560> I'll<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.680> ahead<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
dialog here so I'll go ahead and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.249 
dialog here so I'll go ahead and
reposition<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.579> let<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> that's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
reposition this now let go and that's

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
reposition this now let go and that's
been<00:01:49.439> resized<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:49.979> me<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> point

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
important is I can take text and I can

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.300 
important is I can take text and I can
add<00:04:15.519> text<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.209> top<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.660> my<00:04:16.810> separated<00:04:17.769> file<00:04:18.070> I

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
add text on top of my separated file I

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.190 
add text on top of my separated file I
could<00:04:18.370> add<00:04:18.579> different<00:04:19.329> vector<00:04:19.599> elements<00:04:20.049> into

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
could add different vector elements into

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.930 
could add different vector elements into
the<00:04:20.289> background<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.010> really<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.579> value<00:04:21.849> of

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
the background and really the value of

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.670 
the background and really the value of
this<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.300> can<00:04:22.690> take<00:04:22.840> advantage<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.409> spot

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
this is I can take advantage of the spot

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.530 
this is I can take advantage of the spot
color

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
color

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.090 
color
you<00:04:25.140> know<00:04:25.200> colors<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.590> are<00:04:25.680> being<00:04:25.800> used<00:04:25.980> in

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
you know colors that are being used in

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.940 
you know colors that are being used in
my<00:04:26.220> design<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.690> can<00:04:27.840> assign<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.350> to

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
my design and I can assign that to

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.670 
my design and I can assign that to
produce<00:04:29.160> crisp<00:04:29.670> you<00:04:30.330> know<00:04:30.420> vector<00:04:30.780> text<00:04:31.230> so

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
produce crisp you know vector text so

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.080 
produce crisp you know vector text so
I'm<00:04:31.740> going<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.160> know<00:04:32.220> change<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.550> site<00:04:32.850> or

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
I'm going to you know change the site or

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.030 
I'm going to you know change the site or
change<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:33.570> style<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:33.960> font<00:04:34.500> being<00:04:34.740> deployed

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
change the style of font being deployed

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.130 
change the style of font being deployed
I'll<00:04:35.280> change<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.640> size<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.270> what<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:36.810> could<00:04:37.020> do

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
I'll change the size and what I could do

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.260 
I'll change the size and what I could do
is<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.620> can<00:04:37.680> click<00:04:38.070> one<00:04:38.310> time<00:04:38.340> on<00:04:38.820> one<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:39.090> these

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
is I can click one time on one of these

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.210 
is I can click one time on one of these
spot<00:04:39.630> colors<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.170> assign<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:41.130> that

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
spot colors and assign that to that

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.520 
spot colors and assign that to that
vector<00:04:41.520> text<00:04:42.090> or<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.750> vector<00:04:42.870> shapes<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.470> I

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
vector text or the vector shapes that I

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.260 
vector text or the vector shapes that I
want<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.800> take<00:04:43.920> advantage<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.460> again<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.150> is

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
want to take advantage of again this is

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.900 
want to take advantage of again this is
going<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.450> give<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.720> way<00:04:46.530> more<00:04:46.860> quality<00:04:47.640> when

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
going to give you way more quality when

going to give you way more quality when
dealing<00:04:48.150> with<00:04:48.300> text<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:48.990> if<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.200> can<00:04:49.530> if<00:04:49.800> you

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
dealing with text so if you can if you

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.440 
dealing with text so if you can if you
have<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.220> ability<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:51.180> know<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.360> you're

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
have the ability to you know and you're

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.150 
have the ability to you know and you're
controlling<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.990> design<00:04:52.290> you're<00:04:52.980> going<00:04:53.100> to

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
controlling the design you're going to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.650 
controlling the design you're going to
want<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.310> separate<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.850> digital<00:04:54.240> elements

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
want to separate the digital elements

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.480 
want to separate the digital elements
and<00:04:54.810> then<00:04:55.350> try<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.530> preserve<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.220> vector

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
and then try to preserve the vector

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.310 
and then try to preserve the vector
elements<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.000> layer<00:04:57.150> those<00:04:57.390> on<00:04:57.630> at<00:04:57.870> this

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
elements and layer those on at this

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.350 
elements and layer those on at this
stage<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.710> workflow<00:04:59.100> okay<00:05:00.000> so<00:05:00.060> what<00:05:00.270> we're

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
stage in the workflow okay so what we're

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.460 
stage in the workflow okay so what we're
going<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.510> do<00:05:00.600> now<00:05:00.720> again<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.230> know<00:05:01.290> make<00:05:01.440> sure

going to do now again you know make sure
you<00:05:01.620> have<00:05:01.710> your<00:05:01.800> separation<00:05:02.460> marks<00:05:02.820> we<00:05:03.300> can<00:05:03.420> go

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
you have your separation marks we can go

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.620 
you have your separation marks we can go
