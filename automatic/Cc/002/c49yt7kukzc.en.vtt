00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.770
 hello to all to divide to for 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.320
 boys for girls because 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.960
 I'll show you how I cook the pumpkin 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.420
 unfortunately due to the program of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 assembly does not make me insert in short, the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 first part of the video where simply 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.320
 I tell you that I use 4 pieces of pumpkin for 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.290
 which I will obviously cut the peel 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.399
 nothing transcendental and I used to view 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.920
 so nothing I send you a big kiss 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.230
 good pumpkin everyone is clear in what hello 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:59.660
 once cleaned the makeup I go to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:59.660
 cut into touches of this size 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.610
 then landro to insert in one 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.180
 non-stick pan with two wedges 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.210
 of garlic still extinguished once 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 put to cook all the pumpkin companies 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.729
 stove and I also add a handful 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.560
 of parsley 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.110
 now we wait about a minute and then 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.759
 we're going to add half a glass of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.060
 water and we will cover our pan with 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.060
 a lid 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.460
 at this point 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.460
 I'm going to add water 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.770
 a glass of water 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.580
 here after about 4 minutes and when the 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.009
 pumpkin started to get a little more 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:17.440
 soft and the time came 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:23.190
 add half vegetable nut and lo 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.190
 I crumble a little for the whole pa of the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:33.330
 so then it will melt and go to give 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.330
 pumpkin flavor 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.550
 now we add also I add one of 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.020
 these chillies that were preskin but 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.530
 that I did I did dry in the sun 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.610
 we also add a little pepper is a 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.610
 pinch of salt 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:26.810
 who was wrong okay Giono 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:33.969
 stirred and cover again in 5 minutes 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.969
 I'll come and see what my pumpkin will look like 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.370
 it's time to turn off the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:48.280
 fire as our pumpkin is ready 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.370
 see when I don't think about this 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.290
 consistency and water will practically be 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.349
 been absorbed by the pumpkin will mean 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.359
