result of how the quilt is going to look
in<00:00:43.500> my<00:00:43.649> head<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.610> start<00:00:45.329> making

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
in my head I just start making

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
in my head I just start making
components<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> first<00:00:47.280> components<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
components so the first components that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.600 
components so the first components that
I<00:00:48.000> made<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> quilt<00:00:49.800> were<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.370> dresden

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
I made with this quilt were the dresden

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.709 
I made with this quilt were the dresden
plates<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:52.100> i<00:00:53.100> knew<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> i<00:00:54.449> needed

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
plates and i knew that i needed

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.750 
plates and i knew that i needed
something<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> center<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> i<00:00:56.489> didn't

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
something in the center and i didn't

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
something in the center and i didn't
want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> put<00:00:57.090> another<00:00:57.270> dresden<00:00:57.719> plate<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
want to put another dresden plate in it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.900 
want to put another dresden plate in it
so<00:00:58.410> i<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.649> kind<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> started<00:00:59.219> drafting<00:00:59.460> some

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so i just kind of started drafting some

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
so i just kind of started drafting some
stuff<00:01:00.289> that<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.320> thought<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> look

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
stuff that i thought was going to look

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
stuff that i thought was going to look
nice<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:02.730> i<00:01:02.789> throw<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.390> my<00:01:03.539> design

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
nice and then i throw it up on my design

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320 
nice and then i throw it up on my design
board<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:05.010> start<00:01:05.250> kind<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.240> know

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

board and just start kind of you know
looking<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> sometimes<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.950> up

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
looking at it and sometimes it's up

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.590 
looking at it and sometimes it's up
there<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> week<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.970> i<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.390> motivation

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
there for a week and i get my motivation

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.730 
there for a week and i get my motivation
and<00:01:10.200> other<00:01:10.290> times<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.549> months

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
and other times it's up there for months

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
and other times it's up there for months
until<00:01:13.740> i<00:01:14.070> figure<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.610> how<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.360> i<00:01:15.390> want<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> do

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
until i figure out how how i want to do

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.789 
until i figure out how how i want to do
it<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.049> i<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it and so that's kind of how i go and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.630 
it and so that's kind of how i go and
then<00:01:20.009> once<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.790> put<00:01:21.030> together<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
then once it's all put together the the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
then once it's all put together the the
actual<00:01:24.030> quilting<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.140> something<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.040> i

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
actual quilting is something that i

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
actual quilting is something that i
design<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.580> paper<00:01:26.850> first<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.229> always

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
design on paper first so it's always

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.580 
design on paper first so it's always
drawn<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> DVD<00:01:31.409> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
drawn out and I actually have a DVD that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.980 
drawn out and I actually have a DVD that
explains<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.670> philosophy<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> go

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
explains the philosophy and how I go

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.800 
explains the philosophy and how I go
about<00:01:34.020> designing<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.640> actual<00:01:36.119> quilting<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
about designing the actual quilting to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.480 
about designing the actual quilting to
it<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:38.030> simple<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:40.189> know<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it because it's really simple I know it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.760 
it because it's really simple I know it
doesn't<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.259> simple

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
doesn't but it is a really really simple

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.630 
doesn't but it is a really really simple
method<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.869> everybody<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.110> grasp<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.770> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
method that everybody can grasp and I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.109 
method that everybody can grasp and I
have<00:01:48.000> some<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.390> fun<00:01:48.509> hand<00:01:49.140> beading

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
have some really fun hand beading

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.460 
have some really fun hand beading
shouldn't<00:01:51.119> say<00:01:51.240> fun<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.200> how<00:01:52.320> much

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
shouldn't say fun I don't know how much

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
shouldn't say fun I don't know how much
fun<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.399> doing<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
fun it was when I was doing it but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
with it I teach a lot so most of my

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.520 
with it I teach a lot so most of my
quilts<00:04:07.390> do<00:04:07.630> come<00:04:07.810> along<00:04:08.049> with<00:04:08.200> me<00:04:08.230> when<00:04:08.470> I

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
quilts do come along with me when I

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.570 
quilts do come along with me when I
teach<00:04:08.829> so<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.220> can

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
teach so that I can

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.630 
teach so that I can
show<00:04:09.850> people<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:11.500> know<00:04:11.620> what<00:04:12.310> they<00:04:12.490> can

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
show people you know what they can

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.600 
show people you know what they can
achieve<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:14.100> after<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.280> don't<00:04:15.430> know<00:04:15.550> I

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
achieve and after that I don't know I

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.729 
achieve and after that I don't know I
might<00:04:15.850> sell<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.330> don't<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:17.140> don't<00:04:17.440> know<00:04:17.709> I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
might sell it I don't I don't know I

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.470 
might sell it I don't I don't know I
guess<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.190> can<00:04:18.310> only<00:04:18.400> use<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:18.940> many<00:04:19.030> quilts

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
guess you can only use so many quilts

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.940 
guess you can only use so many quilts
and<00:04:19.630> since<00:04:19.810> these<00:04:19.959> aren't<00:04:20.170> bed<00:04:20.380> quilts<00:04:20.799> it's
