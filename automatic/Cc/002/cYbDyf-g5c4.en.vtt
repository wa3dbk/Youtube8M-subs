00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
you're ready to put it in this is how

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.820 
you're ready to put it in this is how
you<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:06.080> now<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.560> called

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you go about it now when they are called

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.150 
you go about it now when they are called
micro<00:01:08.009> braids<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.950> sections<00:01:10.950> are

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
micro braids is because the sections are

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.630 
micro braids is because the sections are
quite<00:01:11.399> smooth<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.190> best<00:01:14.430> way<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
quite smooth and that's the best way to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.600 
quite smooth and that's the best way to
work<00:01:14.940> with<00:01:15.119> human<00:01:15.479> hair

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
work with human hair

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
work with human hair
why<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:18.090> human<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.050> slippery<00:01:21.560> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
why because human has very slippery and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
why because human has very slippery and
if<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> make<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.250> chance<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.759> lot<00:01:23.940> bigger

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
if you make this chance a lot bigger

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.889 
if you make this chance a lot bigger
then<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.780> will<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.080> look<00:01:25.229> beautiful<00:01:26.899> so

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
then they will not look beautiful so

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.520 
then they will not look beautiful so
once<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.350> gone<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:30.810> braid<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.410> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
once it's gone in you braid it to the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.150 
once it's gone in you braid it to the
point<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> go<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.619> most<00:01:34.619> times<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
point you want it to go to most times is

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.719 
point you want it to go to most times is
used<00:01:35.459> for<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.940> call<00:01:36.149> pick<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> drop<00:01:37.729> pick

and drop when the hair is short then

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.210 
and drop when the hair is short then
it's<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.090> drop<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.569> quicker<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.069> your

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it's you drop it quicker but when your

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.029 
it's you drop it quicker but when your
client<00:01:44.610> sea<00:01:44.729> has<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.179> long<00:01:45.920> depending<00:01:46.920> on

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
client sea has really long depending on

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.969 
client sea has really long depending on
the<00:01:47.160> texture<00:01:47.550> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.970> hair<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:49.440> may<00:01:49.619> decide

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
off just the bits where you connect a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.140 
off just the bits where you connect a
distance<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.530> station<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
distance of a station so this is a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.600 
distance of a station so this is a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
nearly full head of a station that we've

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.900 
nearly full head of a station that we've
done<00:02:19.010> see<00:02:20.010> how<00:02:20.280> beautiful<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.240> looks
