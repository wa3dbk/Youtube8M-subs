because<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.060> demonstrated<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.750> jig<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.080> a

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
because I demonstrated this jig in a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.600 
because I demonstrated this jig in a
previous<00:03:55.500> video<00:03:55.620> mine<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.010> won't<00:03:56.280> go<00:03:56.430> into

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
previous video mine I won't go into

but<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> would<00:03:59.160> like<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.460> mention<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.790> couple

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
but I would like to mention a couple

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.550 
but I would like to mention a couple
points<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.570> thought<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.900> didn't<00:04:01.260> go<00:04:01.350> into

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
points that I thought I didn't go into

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.580 
points that I thought I didn't go into
well<00:04:02.190> enough<00:04:02.460> on<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.700> last<00:04:02.850> video<00:04:03.350> in<00:04:04.350> order

have a granite surface plate and I'm
just<00:05:02.790> going<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:02.940> spray<00:05:03.300> this<00:05:03.450> down<00:05:03.660> with<00:05:03.900> a

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
just going to spray this down with a

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.469 
just going to spray this down with a
little<00:05:04.050> ease<00:05:04.380> of<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.990> then<00:05:06.990> attach<00:05:07.560> my

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
little ease of and then attach my

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:15.940 
little ease of and then attach my
sandpaper<00:05:09.479> right<00:05:09.870> on<00:05:09.990> top

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.800 

once<00:05:16.550> you<00:05:16.640> have<00:05:16.790> your<00:05:16.880> knife<00:05:17.120> locked<00:05:17.510> in<00:05:17.690> the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
once you have your knife locked in the

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.420 
once you have your knife locked in the
jig<00:05:18.050> go<00:05:18.230> ahead<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.470> take<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.620> sharpie<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.160> run

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
jig go ahead and take a sharpie and run

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.310 
jig go ahead and take a sharpie and run
it<00:05:19.550> down<00:05:19.700> the<00:05:19.760> entire<00:05:20.330> width<00:05:20.630> of<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:20.900> bevel

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
it down the entire width of the bevel

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.200 
it down the entire width of the bevel
that<00:05:22.040> way<00:05:22.220> it'll<00:05:22.370> be<00:05:22.430> much<00:05:22.640> easier<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.090> see

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
that way it'll be much easier to see

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.120 
that way it'll be much easier to see
your<00:05:23.330> progress<00:05:23.570> as<00:05:23.990> you're<00:05:24.140> sharpening<00:05:27.130> okay

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
your progress as you're sharpening okay

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
your progress as you're sharpening okay
so<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.370> next<00:05:28.460> thing<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:28.730> want<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:28.910> do<00:05:29.030> is

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
so the next thing you want to do is

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.730 
so the next thing you want to do is
adjust<00:05:29.270> your<00:05:29.570> bevel<00:05:29.870> angle<00:05:29.990> adjustment<00:05:30.530> rod

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
adjust your bevel angle adjustment rod

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.800 
adjust your bevel angle adjustment rod
until<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.610> bevel<00:05:31.880> of<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.000> knife<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:32.540> sitting

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
until the bevel of the knife is sitting

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.160 
until the bevel of the knife is sitting
flat<00:05:33.020> on<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.440> face<00:05:33.980> of<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.220> sandpaper<00:05:34.700> and

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
flat on the face of the sandpaper and

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.360 
flat on the face of the sandpaper and
then<00:05:36.170> after<00:05:36.470> that<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.740> just<00:05:36.770> want<00:05:37.040> to<00:05:37.130> spritz

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
then after that you just want to spritz

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.550 
then after that you just want to spritz
it<00:05:37.490> down<00:05:37.670> with<00:05:37.850> a<00:05:37.880> little<00:05:38.000> water<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:41.380> like<00:05:42.380> to

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
it down with a little water I like to

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.040 
it down with a little water I like to
start<00:05:42.800> with<00:05:42.920> the<00:05:43.220> jig<00:05:43.700> in<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.540> back<00:05:44.720> portion

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
start with the jig in the back portion

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.220 
start with the jig in the back portion
of<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:46.150> sandpaper<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.510> just<00:05:47.570> simply<00:05:47.960> pull<00:05:48.200> it

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
of the sandpaper and just simply pull it

00:05:48.230 --> 00:06:02.350 
of the sandpaper and just simply pull it
