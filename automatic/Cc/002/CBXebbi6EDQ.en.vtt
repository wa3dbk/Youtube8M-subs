00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.139
 today we will learn how to do it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.120
 buy and preserve ground beef 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.799
 it's already a load a little more 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.710
 complicated to buy because the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.090
 normal meat because the normal part 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.140
 We know how she had little. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.960
 manipulation 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 it has little influence there for 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 be contaminated 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.109
 When we talk about ground beef to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 most of the load that becomes 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.050
 in ground meat it is usually meat 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 that was used is separated to be that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.630
 ground meat what we call it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.980
 second ground beef 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.050
 changing in kids according to she will have 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.610
 a greater amount of fat sometimes 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 a little money in it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.480
 How can we see this? 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.789
 the more red meat for the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.190
 better quality it will be the more 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.079
 white dots as it has more color 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 pink has exactly this 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 number of white dots more than 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 second quality it will be you have 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.000
 a good ground beef 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.460
 I suggest you go to a butcher 's 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.680
 confidence choose piece of meat you 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.510
 Do you want to die for your butcher? 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.659
 clean this piece of meat and that he 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.920
 gizzards at least two to three times 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.290
 this will make you have a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.900
 very good ground beef for you to make 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 any kind of meat preparation 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.080
 she tries hard and she has to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.210
 be a very bright red color well alive 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.920
 if it has some filaments 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.509
 some wires this already means a meat 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 of low quality 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.650
 buying ground beef is always a risk 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 depending on where you buy 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.299
 because the meat grinder should be 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.680
 very clean for her to have 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.320
 always a meat of excellent quality 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.990
 and that's not how we know it 's just 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.909
 really trusting our butchery 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 so always buy in your life your 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.759
 Trust your own to 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.350
 to keep the ground meat has a 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.810
 We're going to do the following, little secret. 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:03.960
 get a purse of these and freeze 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 put the ground meat inside and there they go 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.550
 Say, it's so far so far. 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.520
 the novelty is the following we go 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.080
 flatten the ground beef so that it 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.910
 stay very thin 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.580
 this is doing two things first 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.640
 you make the minimum of space within the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.980
 freezer and second it will freeze well 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.050
 fast and will defrost too much 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.330
 Quick when we put here I 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.650
 I'm more or less a pound of 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.540
 ground meat you can freeze up 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.400
 portions when freezing 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.940
 portions and I suggest you make the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.840
 next can pick up the handle of a 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.740
 handle a spoon and you'll cut it 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.460
 in smaller parts without you cutting 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.080
 truth 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.880
 this will make him create 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.350
 exactly this 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:03:00.450
 This link here doubles her. 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:02.160
 on the back and it is ready to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.080
 freeze when you go 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.989
 thawed you can defrost only 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.709
 a part of two or all of them of a 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.959
 turn 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.330
 so you will have ground beef in the portion 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.510
 for one person two or three people or 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.550
 more people and that's how we do it 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.550
 buy and preserve ground beef
