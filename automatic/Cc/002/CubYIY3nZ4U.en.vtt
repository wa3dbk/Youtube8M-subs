at what you're doing you should push a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.920 
at what you're doing you should push a
little<00:02:54.920> harder<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.460> should<00:02:55.730> prove<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.300> you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
little harder you should prove that you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.480 
little harder you should prove that you
deserve<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.320> have<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.830> following<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.400> know

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
deserve to have that following you know
