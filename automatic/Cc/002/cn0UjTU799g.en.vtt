actually<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.380> would<00:03:29.650> be<00:03:29.680> possible<00:03:31.110> why<00:03:32.110> not

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
actually that would be possible why not

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.100 
actually that would be possible why not
I'm<00:03:32.680> gonna<00:03:33.370> think<00:03:33.730> about<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:33.970> but<00:03:34.780> anyways

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
I'm gonna think about that but anyways

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.530 
I'm gonna think about that but anyways
you<00:03:35.290> have<00:03:35.410> here<00:03:35.620> now<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.830> option<00:03:36.310> um<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
you have here now the option um the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.319 
you have here now the option um the
possibility<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.200> check<00:03:38.620> out<00:03:38.799> what<00:03:39.250> i'm<00:03:40.060> using

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
possibility to check out what i'm using

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.210 
possibility to check out what i'm using
for<00:03:40.989> example<00:03:41.049> here<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.590> think<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
for example here I think that the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.270 
for example here I think that the
graphics<00:03:42.640> section<00:03:43.239> is<00:03:43.390> pretty<00:03:44.280> interesting

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
graphics section is pretty interesting

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.360 
graphics section is pretty interesting

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.080 
it anyways so I'm gonna make a charter
and<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:36.009> think<00:04:37.009> it<00:04:37.099> will<00:04:37.219> be<00:04:37.280> pretty<00:04:37.550> cool<00:04:37.819> the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
and I think it will be pretty cool the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.170 
and I think it will be pretty cool the
new<00:04:38.210> intro<00:04:38.509> I<00:04:39.189> don't<00:04:40.189> spend<00:04:40.490> too<00:04:40.669> much<00:04:40.819> time<00:04:40.879> in

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
new intro I don't spend too much time in

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.439 
new intro I don't spend too much time in
it<00:04:41.419> but<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.139> will<00:04:42.289> be<00:04:42.319> shorter<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.069> I<00:04:44.060> think<00:04:44.389> it

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
it but it will be shorter so I think it

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.010 
it but it will be shorter so I think it
would<00:04:44.539> be<00:04:44.569> pretty<00:04:44.810> cool<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:46.389> yes<00:04:47.389> I'm<00:04:47.659> live

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
would be pretty cool and yes I'm live

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.230 
would be pretty cool and yes I'm live
streaming<00:04:48.349> later<00:04:48.680> on<00:04:48.949> I<00:04:49.189> hope<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.939> see<00:04:50.120> you
