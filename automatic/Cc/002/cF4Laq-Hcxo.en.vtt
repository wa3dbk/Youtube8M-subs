when I saw this apartment I saw Anthony

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.720 
when I saw this apartment I saw Anthony
all<00:00:05.100> over<00:00:05.400> it

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730

all over it
Anthony's<00:00:06.299> work<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.870> infused<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.529> the

Anthony's work is infused with the
timeless<00:00:08.280> Sensibility<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.900> think<00:00:10.170> that

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
timeless Sensibility and I think that

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.410 
timeless Sensibility and I think that
speaks<00:00:10.769> true<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.429> veranda<00:00:11.820> reader<00:00:12.030> we

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
speaks true to the veranda reader we

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.330 
speaks true to the veranda reader we
thought<00:00:12.599> Anthony<00:00:13.170> would<00:00:13.380> work<00:00:14.009> really<00:00:14.190> well

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
thought Anthony would work really well

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.129 
thought Anthony would work really well
with<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.700> modern<00:00:15.059> space<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.839> modern

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.779 
with a modern space this is a modern
loft<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.890> thought<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.130> he<00:00:17.430> would<00:00:17.580> bring

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
loft and we thought that he would bring

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.849 
loft and we thought that he would bring
a<00:00:17.940> certain<00:00:18.150> sensuality<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.470> at<00:00:19.710> certain

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
a certain sensuality to it at certain

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.160 
a certain sensuality to it at certain
exotic<00:00:20.490> ism<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.270> when<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.779> showing<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
exotic ism to it when I was showing the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.490 
exotic ism to it when I was showing the
space<00:00:22.439> by<00:00:22.800> Carolyn<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.840> quite<00:00:25.080> taken<00:00:25.350> by

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
space by Carolyn I was quite taken by

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.429 
space by Carolyn I was quite taken by
its<00:00:26.250> openness<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.869> thought<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.289> myself

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
its openness and and I thought to myself

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.200 
its openness and and I thought to myself
who<00:00:29.070> would<00:00:29.220> live<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.580> apartment<00:00:29.760> you
