the<00:03:13.160> back<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:14.240> I<00:03:14.480> think<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.290> plastic

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
the back and I think that the plastic

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.640 
the back and I think that the plastic
covering<00:03:16.300> stripes<00:03:17.300> is<00:03:17.510> for<00:03:17.840> grip<00:03:18.140> grip<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:20.650> it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
covering stripes is for grip grip so it

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.230 
covering stripes is for grip grip so it
actually<00:03:21.860> feels<00:03:22.160> really<00:03:22.340> nice<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:24.170> have
