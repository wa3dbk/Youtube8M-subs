00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.769
This is it, The Firewire Spitfire
Thanks to Surfshop Medusa in Bruges for the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.769
delivery!

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.470
What is so special about Firewire Spitfire?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.150
Uhm well at first it's a board made out of
Firewire material

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.940
Firewire Boards are Hybrid Boards
Which means they are not 100% handmade or

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.260
shaped
But the material makes the boards more durable

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.340
and stronger
Even more important is that they have a much

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.012
bigger flex
which will stay during the entire lifecycle

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:40.940
of the board
As you can see the upper side of the board

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.270
is in Bamboo
That makes this Board the Rapidfire series

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.380
This Bamboo layer makes the Board stronger
and gives it the necessary flex without using

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.090
a stringer
If we turn the board you can see that there

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.600
is no stringer used
In the early days of Firewire you could see

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.780
some black stripes on this side of the board
which made the board extra strong like a stringer

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.700
They are still inside the board, made in the
foam, so you don't see them anymore

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
What is so special about the Spitfire model?

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.110
Well this is if you look at it a shortboard
shape

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.220
But it's not a normal high performance shortboard
but a fat and more wider shortboard for extra

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.780
small days
it's made like a Dominator shape, so in the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.700
same familiy of Firewire boards
You can see that there is almost no rocker

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.290
This makes the board very easy to paddle and
to catch waves very early

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.870
So this shape is like the Dominator shape
but

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.729
at the end you can see that the tail is made
different, somewhat more radical

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.930
This is a diamond tail where the surface is
made smaller if you compare it to the normal

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.090
Dominator roundhouse tail
and they added also a stepdown at the rails

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.619
which make the rails sharper and less surface
when turning

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.869
Don't know if you can see it on the video
but there's a part removed a both sides of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.020
the rails wich gives the board more grip in
the waves

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.750
You can also get them in 2 fin systems, FCS
and Future Fin system, this is FCS

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.079
Like all the Dominator boards you can also
change the fin settings and ride this board

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:30.490
as a Thruster or as Quad
I'm very curious how this board will perform

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.090
in Northsea waves
Can't wait to take it for a surf

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.310
Stay tuned, review will be posted on the Surfbuddha

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.380
Ciao bye bye
