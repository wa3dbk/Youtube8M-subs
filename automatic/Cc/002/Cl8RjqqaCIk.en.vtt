00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.440
 hello everyone face loneliness 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.510
 today we 'll talk direct 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 matrix parameters are very affected 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.440
 also on picture quality 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.859
 how is he showing we are now social 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 consider for example, well , first of all, let's start 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.270
 from the size of the matrix the size of the matrix is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.039
 different we consider three types first type 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.010
 these are small matrices that is now 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 see before you used in 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.560
 compact cameras let parodies 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 called we flew up to here the matrix y 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.210
 follow us little matrix type this 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 middle matrix called medium 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 photographer krapom matted matrix 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.520
 maybe you heard these here it is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520
 is transmitted 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.449
 used in primary cameras 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.300
 level of such you are allowed when 1650 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.300
 also in some allow model 305 100 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.850
 use the 3 matrix button and 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.360
 cameras are already professional 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.939
 level where the matrix size is equal to the size 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.130
 captive lashes then naturally we raise 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.150
 standard buttons 35 millimeters then 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.189
 the frame that fits in this film 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.750
 equal in size to the size of this frame 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.210
 underground 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.880
 in this matrix that it makes it clear that 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.290
 and in the crooked matrix in the matrix 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 full size we can with you 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.909
 cram whistle can have the same 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.520
 the number of megapixels i.e. 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.360
 the number of points registering it 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.810
 Images 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.040
 but not everything is so simple the fact is that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.909
 It appears to understand how dynamic 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 range what is dynamic range 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.009
 dynamic range is the amount 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.259
 levels of contrast which can 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:03.570
 fix look difficult to explain 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:06.090
 but for example, remember how you see 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.220
 let's say a forest on a bright background would not you 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.900
 at the same time you can look at the sky and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:17.010
 forest let's see how it turns out 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.620
 on the camera here's a baby in front of you 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.690
 we see that we can very well 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.360
 see all the details of the child but 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.440
 That if we now come look at 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.300
 the sky then the sky we overexposed that is 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.510
 we don't see the details of the sky 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.530
 and the clouds are not colors. if we are now 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.550
 look at the next frame 00 or focus 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.330
 but not about this 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.300
 we need to show i called we see what 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.400
 the sky here we have drawn perfectly we 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.760
 see the color I would see clouds 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.610
 but we have not seen a child that is 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.310
 that very moment came that very moment 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.310
 when this here 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.450
 the contrast here this was not between and 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.510
 but not highlighted in the foreground 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 particulars now flash is very difficult 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.020
 fix the matrices so here is the matrix with 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.640
 large dynamic range ie 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.050
 look 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.240
 full sized they with such tasks 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.050
 cope easier then see here 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.050
 frame 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.519
 correct yes that is, we see here and 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.550
 foreground well and we see also 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.040
 we can see the details of the sky clouds 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.260
 means why 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.060
 full-size matrix they have a divider 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.239
 shame more why they handle it 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.450
 then here is a picture of you 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.069
 answers this question we see that 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.170
 let's say a matrix of 18 megapixels 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.750
 the crooked matrix is ​​admissible 20 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.910
 megapixels full size yes but you 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.340
 look at the pixel location 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.010
 which registers the light falling 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.989
 matrices that eat and drink or which 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.060
 are close to each other they are small and 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.120
 there is a noise effect , we ask you 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.030
 already talked accordingly 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:17.220
 register here some shares 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.049
 light changes in particular here we have 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.419
 here is a contra contrast 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.060
 spoke here what share change here 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.190
 this is the contrast on the smaller pixels 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.740
 The size is much more complicated than per pixel 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.530
 well, let 's take this principle no secret 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.010
 that is, do not chase megapixels 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.100
 comrades pay attention dynamic 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.139
 the range that is now appeared 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.460
 soapboxes or on which it is written that to us 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.960
 12 megapixels 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.270
 expose what awful there 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.340
 dynamic range. the size 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.580
 the physical size of the pixels itself is still 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.580
 less then there is a dynamic range there 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.310
 very bad well, naturally automation 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.970
 electronics and 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.780
 fulfills it and the processor which 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.360
 trying to compact 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.680
 in compacts they are very smart that is 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.599
 despite the fact that the camera seems to be 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.580
 it seems very simple but they are just 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.330
 engaged in automatically 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.080
 pull out that's all fine-tune the exposure 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.960
 correct 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.830
 and cope with such complex 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.729
 objects when all the sky is bright and 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.770
 dark-dark guys understandable yes here in 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.949
 principle and all that matter is me which means 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.800
 dynamic range and by the way forgot 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.060
 add that crop matrices from 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.099
 full sized connects 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.530
 about one and a half times why 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.099
 approximately because there is one and 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.340
 six 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:44.370
 there is this 114 and so on but 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.169
 approximately one and a half times the matrix 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:52.680
 Large is smaller than the size of the photo frames 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.159
 that is, the full-fat size is not that is 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.400
 matrices 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:59.419
 Crop size up to mirror 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.759
 cameras and full-size matrix 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:06.539
 full matrix is ​​definitely better 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:10.139
 in terms of dynamic range in 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.939
 In principle, matrices are probably all for everyone 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.830
 bye to my channel 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.830
 spread being happy
