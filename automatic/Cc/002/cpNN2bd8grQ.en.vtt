 with thin rope, what is there to do? 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.850
 late 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.850
 a little more 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.530
 of rosary 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.410

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.849
 November we are spinning ordinary you 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.330
 we help 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.330
 good said 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.080
 actually 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:23.230
 the boy 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.230
 but the people always or marrakech 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.539
 the insurance that I want so much 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.970
 something show you just based on the room 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.259
 uncontrolled breakdown 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.819
 but more than anything they are from Morocco the 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.949
 true that the real madrid the club if 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.599
 he takes it seriously but the fans do not 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.090
 they are so involved in the club world cup 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.129
 is very close and they say that the most 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.479
 nothing will be fan of san lorenzo and 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.310
 much Moroccan who will fight for the 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.990
 real madrid because obviously it's the 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.199
 team that is more attractive with a 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.939
 logical question and others not here in 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.699
 Argentina 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.800
 blue to see that's the question for fede 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.550
 or real madrid I'm fighting hard 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.550
 by the rancher 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.710
 I like it that way 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.150
 accompanying them all week 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.950
 the stages of the liberators 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.510
 so keep in mind is these play 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.820
 with real madrid also to san lorenzo 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:27.840
 with the Australian team the winners 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.760
 they play on Saturday 16 30 in the final here 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.770
 let's hope this san lorenzo tomorrow goes 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.420
 for his party I hope that salary because 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.070
 be an Argentine team again a 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.260
 end of silver students with 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.400
 that barcelona that is not given is almost in 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.990
 the last minute beat Barcelona 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.450
 dementia that the record of that candle 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.250
 so why can not you give a 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.800
 room bump those deadlines passed 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.780
 first as I said see it in racing but 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.210
 It is also on the sides because because 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.940
 first you have to watch today's game of 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.480
 rne madrid a bear and tomorrow's match 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:59.400
 obviously from san lorenzo against australia 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.120
 no I'm not very calm to this part 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.870
 Hernán gives me tranquility 

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.870
 is a person
