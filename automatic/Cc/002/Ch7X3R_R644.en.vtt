 minecraft every very holy time to one 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.159
 beautiful interface not even heavy 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.259
 look how easy it opens up and let's go to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.119
 see the move as you see it now 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.290
 inside the 1.8 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.119
 look how nice we guys are in 1.8 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.890
 1.8 let's see if there are any 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.380
 things are the new doors here 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.900
 the 1.8 who is this the door of the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.150
 point them 8 and we finally have the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.909
 boxing and map with hicks opens the map 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.560
 great we can if I'm not mistaken to zoom 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.049
 plus we can put away points 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.490
 with the abi boys and with the b but i 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.259
 waypoint and the cool one 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.820
 in what sense the physical one , that is you 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 remember those other bad maps that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.670
 they are now chasing me these 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.280
 beautiful lights that indicate yours 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.220
 mark and distance indicate the name in 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.270
 correct way ie and look at the mini 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.920
 map as you see well 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.439
 look in the mini but then i will 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.969
 triangles instead of diamonds, those and yes 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.780
 they see all the mo's because they are now 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.490
 underground 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.750
 look now i'm going underground 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.460
 in fact begin to see each other too 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 new elements 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.489
 it is also compatible with the nether very well 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.080
 from what was written in the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.509
 description or god we are in front of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 zombie 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.769
 hello zombie you can see very well too 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.239
 underground we see a lot of you 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.370
 surely others will know it not 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.269
 have never seen but I think the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.390
 I believe that the map is the fashion of the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.670
 Minecraft's best maps are not there 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.590
 nothing compares to this map is 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.079
 best map to the best fashions for the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.190
 maps and now the day for 1.8 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.049
 together with the ate lauder 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.549

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.510
