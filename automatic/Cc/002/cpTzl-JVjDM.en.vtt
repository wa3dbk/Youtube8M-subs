00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
interesting I thought how they put that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.729 
interesting I thought how they put that
in<00:04:16.310> here<00:04:16.489> because<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:17.140> haven't<00:04:18.140> read<00:04:18.380> about<00:04:18.680> a

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
in here because I haven't read about a

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.039 
in here because I haven't read about a
guy<00:04:19.580> living<00:04:19.850> in<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.120> ground<00:04:20.360> as<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.570> mushroom

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
guy living in the ground as a mushroom

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.500 
guy living in the ground as a mushroom
in<00:04:21.650> any<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.220> books<00:04:22.460> or<00:04:22.760> any<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.180> movies

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
in any of the books or any of the movies

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.990 
in any of the books or any of the movies
but<00:04:24.200> it's<00:04:24.470> probably<00:04:24.920> just<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.490> thing

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
but it's probably just the thing

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.030 
but it's probably just the thing
