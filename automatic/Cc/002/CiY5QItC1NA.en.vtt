00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 we want to share with all of you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.359
 It's called pudding and it's perfect for 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.189
 all those who do not be 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 daring ever to prepare a cake or a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 biscuit has some very simple steps 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.000
 for its preparation and also the advantage 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.609
 that is a very very economical recipe 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 for the ingredients that you take you see that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 the basis of the ingredients is a ghana 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.850
 of old bread with which will begin with the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 recipe saving and converting a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.059
 hard-boiled bread of those who hear in a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.710
 dessert to surprise our 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.540
 no more guests 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 I'm going to show you the ingredients 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.079
 we are going to need 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.899
 about three-quarters of a bar 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.829
 old bread we need 250 grams of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.250
 sugar about 30-40 grams of breadcrumbs 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.989
 four eggs and 500 milliliters of milk 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.270
 we have also reserved a little bit of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.160
 flour and margarine to put in the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.600
 mold before pouring the mixture and when 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.790
 we put it to give what does not stick 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.340
 The first thing we are going to do is take a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.799
 well wide container to start 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.659
 make the mixture we will remove around 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.659
 a quarter of the loaf of bread and we 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 we keep and we will catch on the others 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.850
 three quarters of loaf of bread we're going to 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.960
 cut into pieces like that by hand and we're going 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.960
 to go throwing everything in the container 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.350
 and there we have it the following 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.439
 we will do is to throw that half a liter of 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.439
 milk 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.930
 of the 250 grams of sugar we are going to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.880
 have to reserve a little bit for 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.979
 then sprinkle over so what 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.659
 let's go throwing and we will try 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.380
 stay more or less with a fifth 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.360
 part about 50 grams so more or less 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.960
 it's fine the next thing we'll do is going to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.890
 be lay eggs 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.890
 one by one 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.870
 and four eggs 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.940
 with a fork we will take care of 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.590
 break the eggs and mix everything 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.450
 all right 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.940
 we are going to make sure everything is fine 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.610
 distributed so that the bread of the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 sugar from eggs and milk to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.000
 equal parts 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.800
 let's leave it for about 10 minutes 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.810
 soak well and we will take advantage of that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.400
 time to prepare the mold and 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.470
 preheating the oven to 210 degrees 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.220
 with the help of a brush or if we do not have 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.930
 with a kitchen paper we are going to extend 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.090
 butter or margarine for all 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.620
 edges of our mold and so we will avoid 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.379
 that the pudding sticks when we are in 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.689
 the special oven care for cultures 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.970
 and to the corners when you see that it is 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.069
 all well well smeared that we have not 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.349
 left not a single part without putting 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.230
 butter or margarine what we will do 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.310
 It will be with a little bit of flour 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.310
 sprinkle inside 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.480
 handing out the giving so 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.380
 taps so that it stays throughout the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.820
 so we have our mold 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.190
 ready to directly cast the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.900
 content what we are going to do now is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.430
 crumble everything well with the help of a 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.430
 blender so let's go there 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.840
 and well, it's already after about 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.880
 minutes beating you have like the dough 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.040
 become much more homogeneous and is the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.390
 moment of talk in the mold is now 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.400
 the moment to recover the touch that 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.530
 we had saved and the breadcrumbs that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.980
 I told you at the beginning we go with the help of 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.960
 a spatula or a spoon to throw 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.180
 all the contents of the bowl inside the 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.250
 mold with the content inside the mold 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.560
 what we are going to do is sprinkle that 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.300
 bread crumbs on top after giving 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.440
 that layer of bread crumbs we go with the 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.690
 sugar 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.970
 little by little we will go throwing 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.250
 over with bread crumbs and sugar 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.290
 sprinkled over we're going to 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.740
 add a little cinnamon that we 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.740
 love 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.500
 with that little bit of cinnamon that you put 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.750
 your taste is the time to put it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.460
 we're going to put the body in the oven 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.460
 the furnace carefully burn us 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.229
 Y 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.650
 after 40 minutes we are going to take out the pudding 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.650
 from the oven 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.860
 well nothing after the 40 minutes of 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.379
 oven that have been needed to finish 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.340
 our gooding here we have it 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.080
 practically ready to take to the 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.180
 table will only need attention 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.759
 a little bit between one and two hours so 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.529
 serve it hot and now we hope that 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.659
 this recipe that is true of lamu 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.210
 I encourage you to try in your 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.159
 houses and that you enjoy it so from 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.330
