 for another video and this time I'm going 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.000
 present to you a helmet the power 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:16.049
 hjc rph 10 graphite lorenzo which is a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 replica of pilot jorge lorenzo was 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.750
 used in the year 2013 last year in 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.519
 race and won in the city of catalunya 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:31.009
 is practically identical to rph models 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.140
 10 is the only line changes only the graphics 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.719
 it only rained the front of the company 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.059
 exactly this party to say here a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.450
 clear visor with these outputs 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.200
 air and here the series the front 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.879
 I have the option to close here I have 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.309
 the side 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.309
 sponsored by the monster which is a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.739
 energy drink here has the signal 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.989
 the symbol that is also inscribed 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 monster energy 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 You're looking at animal graphics. 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.070
 It was pretty much also has some 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.210
 things written on him orland too 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 It is online and has several things written 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 I'll tell you more about this graphic than the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 technology is used in this helmet a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.590
 actually fiber integration 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.630
 various fibers 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.329
 This is a template that contains apm one 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.090
 acronym in English that translating would be a 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.720
 matrix maid premium which is compound 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 of carbon fiber together with fiber 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.380
 organic fiber glass plus one fiber 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.890
 special that is a temptation a term 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.829
 different that it is an Aramid time then 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 are four compounds that make up this 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.210
 The English mix would be premium 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.299
 I integrated matrix so it 's a composition 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.590
 of four components in the hull of this 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.119
 this helmet here that ends up 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.009
 in a very light capacity and a 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.640
 very light and extremely medium helmet 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.090
 here is the weight of him one thousand and 350 grams 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.870
 thousand 350 grams it also has a system 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.290
 is called acs and by our Portuguese 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.480
 would be advanced ventilation system that 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.160
 It's this theme from the front. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.470
 I no longer think it 's best for you 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.640
 see her grandmother driving here one by 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.050
 delayed there is exactly here in the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.959
 front of the helmet then there are two of the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.810
 two buttons here that I spin 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.570
 I rule and will leave the helmet well. 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.450
 the air vents are exactly 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.900
 Behind you you 'll get well but these are 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.760
 two exits here so you have one 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.820
 helmet that has a very good relation 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.100
 you've had very little 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.950
 noise from outside is a helmet 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.280
 the racing then you can rotate very high 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.989
 speed you practically stay 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.730
 very well 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.620
 is both in the sense of protection and 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.959
 also you sound practically new 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.110
 a lot is happening outside of course 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.720
 you hear but not so much and the ventilation 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.079
 A great one is also excellent. 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.790
 it is also composed of an ep the 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.340
 fire that most people are patient with, right? 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.890
 which is a very easy system of exchange of 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.019
 visor you already know who also 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.329
 pinocchio system also in my opinion 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.150
 but today this helmet is a system 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.320
 anti rather than actually here on the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.269
 front 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.709
 it's one thing to avoid buying separate 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.480
 There is a film inside that visor. 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.829
 that you can blow inside that does not 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.260
 gets blurry 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.100
 it's awesome it's a separate accessory 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.690
 I put it here since it is very quiet 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.380
 you hardly stay, you do not stay 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.540
 Blurry is practically $ 20 more 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.709
 or less the price of those hours you do not see 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.750
 helmet 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.299
 I did not like you, but it 's in the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.950
 church in his bin is very good a lot 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.630
 even to see until when you go is 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.359
 using in traffic to reconsider you 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.070
 because it makes it difficult to pass 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.470
 real here it is to be used in high 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.329
 velocity 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.169
 so if you use this majority here in 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.390
 City 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.530
 I advise you not to use it because it will 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.030
 stay one day inspired 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.920
 America is very good 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.590
 also has an uncle system is 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.550
 if you open the visor 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.150
 You close and here's a treatment 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.460
 Special 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.850
 You 'll hear it, but there's a 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.110
 here lever she raises 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.120
 You have to be quite generous about 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.440
 The longer you use a lot of time without washing 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:50.460
 you'll hardly feel you'll feel 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.540
 the odors needed here, then the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.770
 here it facilitates the absorption of sweat and 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.700
 will not leave much scent on your 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.950
 helmet 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.260
 this is very useful legal that also 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.330
 closing owner who is the 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.940
 best closure is that it is 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.610
 used on moto gp 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.780
 the safest closure you have 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.900
 different from those latches 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.080
 I am sincerely the first criterion 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.350
 that I use when buying a helmet is if 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.600
 His closure is that's how it is here. 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.180
 which is safer than it is in the world 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.250
 you can buy it with your eyes closed and 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.660
 look what happened to already home 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.310
 since the helmet left the head of the group 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.550
 pilot's 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.680
 very few exceptions, I do not know if it 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.520
 happens imagine with that treatment 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.710
 there lock it is the most conventional 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.940
 and helmet it was designed these 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.890
 drawings that you see here in the 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.680
 here was designed by 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.380
 A girl named Nave is a Spanish. 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.460
 now she has to dominate and she's done 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.500
 doing here 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:01.830
 the detailing all the helmet graphics 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.640
 was made by her including a 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.610
 curiosity 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:10.800
 Jorge lorenzo he he the helmet he 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:14.430
 used in the race mended for children of the 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.220
 amount raised in the auction was used 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.940
 to help children with 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.520
 down 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.229
 there Catalonia in Spain then this is it 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.180
 so guys, I really liked this one. 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.580
 helmet I think a helmet 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.070
 excellent top of the line 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.530
 the graphics of it without even talking is 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.700
 very beautiful, and the price of it 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.780
 costs $ 600 is a high price 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.810
 helmets masks united states 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.190
 this price 600 dollars already with the tax 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.050
 from round up 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.810
 here in brazil no comments you 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.280
 find law punishes 600 000 and 700 real or 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.419
 up to at least this is the minimum value 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.790
 that you find 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:55.660
 I've been using it already for a while 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.220
 Okay, I hoped to close some time with him. 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.260
 to know if it really is good helmet 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.200
 or his mother of that boy edited until 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.290
 Thinking about taking another model is in the 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.750
 true even model the rp h10 only with 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.150
 other graphics because I really liked

 helmet here too I bought the visors 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.930

 But you are what?
