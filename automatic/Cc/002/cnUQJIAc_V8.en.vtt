00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello how about blasini good today 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.670
 I bring you this tutorial of how pixels 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.930
 to the image that you want for 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.930
 example this would be the image of me 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.480
 profile the profile and good picture has 200 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.770
 in width by 200 in height can see 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.070
 It is completely made blocks of 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.070
 Minecraft 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.590
 It is an excellent portrait and good 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.930
 I will teach how to do it let's go to the tutorial 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.300
 ok the first thing we have to have are 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.370
 these files that would be the kraft sprint 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.739
 foods and the ms editor that would be the map 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.140
 editor and the image of the image that you 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.440
 you want pixel and ok 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.390
 well first we open the brand 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.010
 this is to increase the memory in the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.050
 descriptions I'll leave in case you want to see 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.940
 the tutorial that is once opened in 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.580
 macramÃ© forming a player that was the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.270
 new world an objective mode the 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.460
 options of the world we put super flat and 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.850
 we give you create the world but we hope 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.720
 yard 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.860
 ok once I load the world 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.790
 we hope that we will surrender less 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.720
 we place here below 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.720
 qatar blocks 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.090
 wait a good moment now we give 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.750
 we must go to save and return to the menu 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.940
 principal 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.690
 Well now what we do is verify 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.690
 to see if our world 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 perfect 4-4 and the amount we got 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.580
 from here 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.230
 we opened the kraft spray 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.230
 where says run spain full 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.149
 the most serious we look for the image that 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.729
 we want it would be choose a transform 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.590
 would this be the measures that I recommend 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.409
 it's 200 x 200 that you mentioned that you can 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.049
 rendering puts in sight and good 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.659
 we have been among the biggest I put it 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.140
 better treated in the image so it looks 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.010
 we give know here they know where you say you know 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.110
 that there is more 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.150
 we chose a saved route that 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.239
 would the desk be a name for 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.239
 example 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.650
 dominique to save we close here 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.890
 we close here that it's over with this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.490
 folder now normal for the editor map 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.490
 a map edited in 56 was very expensive 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.030
 let's see the world 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.030
 the new world that we create right now 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.910
 and there we are, let's see here where it says 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.810
 import 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.260
 we look where we keep this clinic 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.310
 April 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.310
 we place here 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.980
 see an excellent portrait we give import 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.670
 control 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.189
 we have here where you know or 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.049
 simply the improvement and once 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.660
 controls and we expect you to load the 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.270
 bar quickly 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.310
 we close alternate 4 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.640
 now the only thing left is to open 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.640
 mime 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.629
 the world that we would have created 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.790
 and good as you can see it was created 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.680
 perfectly the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.680
 the pixelated of transformers 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.300
 in a perfect portrait 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.090
 what the rendering has to be 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.970
 traveling all 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.970
 all the box and about rendering 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.270
 to be a very good portrait 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.120
 a picture of different textures like 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.120
 trunks of wool and all that stuff 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.350
 and if we move away we can see 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.970
 exactly the same photo I had of 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.320
 although there are some transformers to the 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.150
 tutorial remember upload all the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.150
 Monday and Friday and see you in a 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.840
 next metlife occasion if you liked it 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.840
 and chau
