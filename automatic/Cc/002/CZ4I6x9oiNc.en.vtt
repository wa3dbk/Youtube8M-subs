00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
is only 36 feet under the ground or off

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.130 
is only 36 feet under the ground or off
the<00:01:51.800> static<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.150> it's<00:01:53.360> very<00:01:53.570> close<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
the static so it's very close to the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.570 
the static so it's very close to the
surface<00:01:54.470> which<00:01:54.620> makes<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:54.980> ideal<00:01:55.070> because<00:01:55.460> you

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
surface which makes it ideal because you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.310 
surface which makes it ideal because you
have<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.850> do<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.060> last<00:01:56.210> warp<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.810> bring<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> up

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
have to do the last warp to bring it up

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.250 
have to do the last warp to bring it up

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
hose on the other side of the tee as a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.970 
hose on the other side of the tee as a
spigot<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:32.990> hard<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> see<00:02:33.470> on<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.770> side

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
spigot you it's hard to see on that side

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.090 
spigot you it's hard to see on that side
but<00:02:34.430> just<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.700> standard<00:02:35.060> spigot<00:02:35.870> go<00:02:36.680> ahead<00:02:36.950> and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
but just a standard spigot go ahead and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.729 
but just a standard spigot go ahead and
take<00:02:37.430> your<00:02:37.520> spigot<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.720> screw<00:02:39.230> your<00:02:39.350> hose<00:02:39.500> to

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
take your spigot and screw your hose to

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.699 
take your spigot and screw your hose to
it<00:02:40.120> make<00:02:41.120> sure<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.360> open<00:02:41.660> your<00:02:41.780> spigot<00:02:42.170> and

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
it make sure you open your spigot and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.110 
it make sure you open your spigot and
now<00:02:42.920> what<00:02:43.100> we're<00:02:43.250> doing<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.610> when<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:43.880> pump

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
now what we're doing is when we pump

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.150 
now what we're doing is when we pump
we're<00:02:44.330> back<00:02:44.600> feeding<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.080> whole<00:02:45.230> system<00:02:45.650> so

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
we're back feeding the whole system so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.620 
we're back feeding the whole system so
instead<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.430> getting<00:02:46.550> water<00:02:46.880> here<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.300> get<00:02:47.540> it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
instead of getting water here I get it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.199 
instead of getting water here I get it
right<00:02:47.780> at<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.900> house<00:02:48.310> it's<00:02:49.310> very<00:02:49.610> easy<00:02:49.970> to

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
right at the house it's very easy to

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.600 
right at the house it's very easy to
pump<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.750> I'm<00:02:50.840> only<00:02:51.350> got<00:02:51.590> 36<00:02:51.950> feet<00:02:52.400> but

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
pump see and I'm only got 36 feet but

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.650 
pump see and I'm only got 36 feet but
left<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.489> can<00:02:55.670> pressurize<00:02:56.060> my<00:02:56.360> pressure

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
left and I can pressurize my pressure

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.390 
left and I can pressurize my pressure
tank<00:02:57.080> if<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.860> well<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
tank if you have a well you have a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.500 
tank if you have a well you have a
pressure

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.649 

right<00:03:02.440> now<00:03:02.590> I'm<00:03:02.769> about<00:03:02.909> 40<00:03:03.909> psi<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.569> that

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
right now I'm about 40 psi and that

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.229 
right now I'm about 40 psi and that
would<00:03:04.810> give<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.110> wonderful<00:03:05.650> shower<00:03:06.239> my

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
would give you a wonderful shower my

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.330 
would give you a wonderful shower my
pressure<00:03:07.510> tank<00:03:07.810> set<00:03:08.080> set<00:03:08.379> up<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.650> go<00:03:08.769> up<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.980> 60

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
pressure tank set set up to go up to 60

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.550 
pressure tank set set up to go up to 60
psi<00:03:09.549> so<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:09.970> could<00:03:10.180> pressurize<00:03:10.599> this<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.989> 60<00:03:11.379> and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
psi so I could pressurize this to 60 and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.649 
psi so I could pressurize this to 60 and
I'll<00:03:12.069> probably<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.580> about<00:03:12.760> seven<00:03:13.209> eight

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
I'll probably have about seven eight

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.899 
I'll probably have about seven eight
minutes<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:14.290> water<00:03:14.590> continuous<00:03:15.549> use<00:03:15.730> without

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
minutes of water continuous use without

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.869 
minutes of water continuous use without
pumping<00:03:16.599> this<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:18.160> one<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.549> smaller

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
pumping this I have one of the smaller

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.130 
pumping this I have one of the smaller
tanks<00:03:19.330> so<00:03:19.420> if<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.540> have<00:03:19.629> a<00:03:19.690> bigger<00:03:19.900> pressure

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
tanks so if you have a bigger pressure

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.380 
tanks so if you have a bigger pressure
tank<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.950> might<00:03:21.099> be<00:03:21.220> able<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.430> stretch<00:03:21.790> out<00:03:21.970> 20

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
tank you might be able to stretch out 20

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.509 
tank you might be able to stretch out 20
minutes<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.750> water<00:03:22.989> use<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:24.010> that's<00:03:24.160> very

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
minutes of water use so that's very

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.000 
minutes of water use so that's very

installed<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.329> this<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:37.989> 12<00:03:38.319> volt<00:03:38.530> motor

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
installed and this is a 12 volt motor

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.460 
installed and this is a 12 volt motor
that<00:03:39.099> will<00:03:39.250> hook<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:40.290> powered<00:03:41.290> by<00:03:41.440> a

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that will hook to this powered by a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.490 
that will hook to this powered by a
sharp<00:03:41.859> panel<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.480> controller<00:03:43.959> on<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.290> wall

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
sharp panel and a controller on the wall

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.339 
sharp panel and a controller on the wall
here<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.970> will<00:03:46.150> then<00:03:46.510> disconnect<00:03:47.140> not

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
here and we will then disconnect not

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.740 
here and we will then disconnect not
totally<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.220> turn<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.700> switch<00:03:48.970> we<00:03:49.720> will

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
totally but just turn the switch we will

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.809 
totally but just turn the switch we will
not<00:03:49.989> use<00:03:50.170> our<00:03:50.319> commercial<00:03:50.829> grid<00:03:51.609> power

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
anymore we will go totally off-grid to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.800 
anymore we will go totally off-grid to
supply<00:03:54.790> all<00:03:54.970> our<00:03:55.000> water<00:03:55.359> needs<00:03:55.420> at<00:03:55.720> the
