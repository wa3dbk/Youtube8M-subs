00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 guys all hello to you vladimir 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:17.460
 Andreevich is tyunin mountains 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:19.439
 the fourth part went while warming up 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.449
 our second speaker I want to tell you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.750
 how to cover the ceiling in the cabin 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.730
 Alcantara how to paint the caliper and how 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.510
 same paint the salons items so they 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.510
 then not peeled off 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.230
 with the right approach and paints the caliper 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.570
 easy remove wheels remove 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.500
 brake pads we take masking tape 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.940
 with the help of him and the almighty newspaper 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 glue everything we're not going 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.930
 paint 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.420
 we process a support from dirt 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.220
 you can brush it on 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.560
 conveniently we used a drill with 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.150
 special nozzle 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.550
 wipe with solvent and degrease 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.869
 to completely remove 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.729
 various oils dirt bitumen and all that 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.530
 this road shit that could 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.810
 during operation get on the caliper 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.880
 proceed to painting the first layer we 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.830
 we put thin enough for the best 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 adhesion second and third layers 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.900
 fatter for the brightest 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.270
 colors we use heat resistant paint 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.979
 so that it doesnâ€™t get stuck in the process 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.020
 operating because the caliper itself 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.360
 heats up to very high temperatures 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.340
 each layer is dried with a hairdryer for greater 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.290
 strength and of course we collect everything in 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.030
 reverse order set new 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.950
 brake pads because old 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.270
 came kabzdets frank after the past 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.869
 host calipers 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.869
 have finished 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.579
 for starters, we remove fasteners 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.090
 the ceiling after which we take out himself 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.810
 ceiling carry it to the cutting table 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.810
 degrease and clean 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.079
 during the stitching process make sure that 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.860
 alcantara nod to lodz and not 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.049
 pondered 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.620
 otherwise she is cracking down very 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.620
 problematic 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.200
 well and 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.910
 but 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.660
 at the end of the stitching we tuck 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.030
 the edges 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.470
 make cuts in the corners it will help 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.470
 easier for you to wrap the edges 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.160
 though 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.120
 tell you about painting technology 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.910
 after we removed the cabin parts we 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.680
 we carry their workshop what we do first 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.590
 thoroughly sand the skin we 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.960
 used 600,800 for better pro 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.610
 skins of these elements on the first 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.860
 Stage for painting we use 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.290
 special primer for plastic he 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.110
 well enhances adhesion second run 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.720
 went black metallic paint in three layers 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.610
 for maximum covering power and third 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.030
 approach is matte varnish which we 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.770
 inflicted in three layers of spray can why 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.080
 from the spray can and because he was in 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.820
 I didn't bother with paint 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.940
 It keeps enough elements in the salons 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.609
 good and problems when operating with it 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:25.910
 never had the most important layer 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:28.100
 this is the first remember let you down 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.470
 the bottom line is just the beginning 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.660
 external and internal improvements in our 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.490
 chickens well as you saw nothing 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.590
 difficult in these processes if you 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.900
 have straight arms a great desire and 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.140
 minimal set of tools that much 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.180
 you can make yourself absolutely 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.430
 I wish you all direct hands of happiness and good 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.430
 world see tuning raw all goodbye
