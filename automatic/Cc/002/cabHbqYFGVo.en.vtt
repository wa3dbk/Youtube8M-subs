position right now this handle will turn
this<00:01:34.470> down<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.039> lowers<00:01:35.429> it<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.509> our<00:01:36.630> point<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
this down it lowers it to our point of

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.990 
this down it lowers it to our point of
contact<00:01:36.959> behind<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.649> belt<00:01:37.830> it's<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.849> there

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
contact behind the belt it's all there

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.419 
contact behind the belt it's all there
is<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.330> platen<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.700> control<00:01:42.090> side

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
is for the platen and the control side

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.230 
is for the platen and the control side
this<00:01:44.429> is<00:01:44.580> our<00:01:44.789> main<00:01:45.209> disconnect<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:45.899> power

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
this is our main disconnect for power

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.150 
this is our main disconnect for power
this<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.539> this<00:01:49.259> little<00:01:49.319> light<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.099> just

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
this little this little light it just

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.760 
this little this little light it just
tells<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.910> tracking<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.140> expect<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.560> see

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
tells the tracking so we expect to see

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
tells the tracking so we expect to see
that<00:01:52.950> blink<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.399> off<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.789> tells<00:01:54.000> us<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that blink on and off it tells us the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.900 
that blink on and off it tells us the
belt<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.599> tracking<00:01:54.989> back<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.319> forth<00:01:55.910> control

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
belt is tracking back and forth control

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.300 
belt is tracking back and forth control
voltage<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:58.050> one<00:01:58.410> of<00:01:58.500> our<00:01:58.560> east<00:01:58.860> ops<00:01:59.099> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
voltage if one of our east ops is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.699 
voltage if one of our east ops is
depressed<00:01:59.819> they<00:02:00.330> off<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.690> be<00:02:00.780> reset<00:02:01.229> before<00:02:01.470> we

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
depressed they off to be reset before we

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.370 
depressed they off to be reset before we
get<00:02:01.860> control<00:02:02.250> voltage<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.239> any<00:02:03.720> e-stops<00:02:04.170> gonna

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
get control voltage so any e-stops gonna

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.889 
get control voltage so any e-stops gonna
knock<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.880> need<00:02:06.030> control<00:02:06.450> voltage

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
knock that out you need control voltage

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.220 
knock that out you need control voltage
then<00:02:07.440> we<00:02:07.470> can<00:02:07.679> run<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> table<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.580> down

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.080 

there's<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.830> mechanical<00:02:12.129> digital<00:02:12.790> calendar

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
there's a mechanical digital calendar

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.420 
there's a mechanical digital calendar
