rigged up is great and that's the way it
should<00:04:04.959> be<00:04:04.989> for<00:04:05.109> open<00:04:05.500> water<00:04:05.530> when<00:04:06.250> you're

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
should be for open water when you're

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.099 
should be for open water when you're
fishing<00:04:06.639> away<00:04:06.939> from<00:04:07.150> weeds<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.569> down<00:04:07.719> deeper

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
fishing away from weeds and down deeper

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.690 
fishing away from weeds and down deeper
what<00:04:08.650> we<00:04:08.739> should<00:04:08.889> tell<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.159> viewer<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.639> you

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
what we should tell the viewer so you

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.720 
what we should tell the viewer so you
can<00:04:09.879> also<00:04:10.030> rig<00:04:10.419> up<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:11.019> tube<00:04:11.889> so<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:12.549> it's

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
can also rig up a a tube so that it's

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.059 
can also rig up a a tube so that it's
really<00:04:13.329> Texas<00:04:13.870> rig<00:04:14.169> or<00:04:14.319> weedless<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:14.919> what

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
really Texas rig or weedless so what

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.129 
really Texas rig or weedless so what
I've<00:04:15.189> got<00:04:15.370> here<00:04:15.579> is<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.730> tube<00:04:16.060> same<00:04:16.479> length<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.900> 3

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
I've got here is a tube same length is 3

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.319 
I've got here is a tube same length is 3
inches<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.680> I've<00:04:18.190> got<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> small<00:04:18.759> hook<00:04:19.150> I

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
inches and I've got a small hook I

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.360 
inches and I've got a small hook I
believe<00:04:19.599> this<00:04:19.780> one<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.079> like<00:04:20.259> a<00:04:20.289> number<00:04:20.560> 4<00:04:21.039> worm

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
believe this one is like a number 4 worm

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.189 
believe this one is like a number 4 worm
hook<00:04:21.669> that's<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.360> worm<00:04:22.509> hook<00:04:22.720> that's<00:04:22.990> right

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
hook that's the worm hook that's right

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.400 
hook that's the worm hook that's right
here<00:04:23.500> now<00:04:23.710> I've<00:04:23.979> put<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:24.849> inside<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.930> tube<00:04:26.169> and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
here now I've put it inside the tube and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.350 
here now I've put it inside the tube and
then<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:26.919> popped<00:04:27.190> out<00:04:27.430> again<00:04:27.729> and<00:04:27.880> then<00:04:28.240> I've

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
then it's popped out again and then I've

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.760 
then it's popped out again and then I've
hooked<00:04:28.479> one<00:04:28.750> side<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.169> tube<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.530> out<00:04:29.620> the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
hooked one side of the tube and out the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.170 
hooked one side of the tube and out the
other<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.099> you<00:04:30.160> can<00:04:30.310> see<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> hook<00:04:30.759> just<00:04:31.000> on

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
other so you can see the hook just on

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.420 
other so you can see the hook just on
top<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:32.050> when<00:04:32.289> it's<00:04:32.440> rigged<00:04:32.650> properly<00:04:33.220> the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
top so when it's rigged properly the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.700 
top so when it's rigged properly the
tube<00:04:33.669> should<00:04:33.910> be<00:04:33.970> straight<00:04:34.539> on<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.289> actual

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
tube should be straight on the actual

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.350 
tube should be straight on the actual
hook<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.160> there's<00:04:36.520> no<00:04:36.639> additional<00:04:36.759> weight

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
hook and there's no additional weight

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.150 
hook and there's no additional weight
unlike<00:04:37.810> this<00:04:37.990> weighted<00:04:38.380> jig<00:04:38.590> head<00:04:38.800> that's<00:04:38.949> in

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
unlike this weighted jig head that's in

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.770 
unlike this weighted jig head that's in
there<00:04:39.340> so<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:39.880> can<00:04:39.910> actually<00:04:40.270> take<00:04:40.479> this<00:04:40.720> and

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
there so I can actually take this and

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.650 
there so I can actually take this and
cast<00:04:41.349> it<00:04:41.590> out<00:04:41.710> all<00:04:42.039> along<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.820> lily<00:04:43.120> pads<00:04:43.419> that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
cast it out all along the lily pads that

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.060 
cast it out all along the lily pads that
are<00:04:43.750> here<00:04:43.900> some<00:04:44.110> of<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.289> other<00:04:44.320> weeds<00:04:44.650> even<00:04:44.949> in

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
are here some of the other weeds even in

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.770 
are here some of the other weeds even in
shallower<00:04:45.400> water<00:04:45.729> it's<00:04:46.389> going<00:04:46.539> to<00:04:46.630> have<00:04:46.750> a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
shallower water it's going to have a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.320 
shallower water it's going to have a
really<00:04:47.020> slow<00:04:47.470> drop<00:04:47.770> rate<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.610> if<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:48.909> just<00:04:49.120> pull

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
really slow drop rate and if I just pull

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.879 
really slow drop rate and if I just pull
it<00:04:49.449> a<00:04:49.539> little<00:04:49.570> bit<00:04:49.960> it'll<00:04:50.139> have<00:04:50.349> a<00:04:50.380> nice<00:04:50.560> action

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
it a little bit it'll have a nice action

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:51.899 
it a little bit it'll have a nice action
from<00:04:51.220> side<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.520> side

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
from side to side

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.700 
from side to side
so<00:04:52.419> no<00:04:52.570> matter<00:04:52.780> whether<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.139> rig<00:04:53.409> it<00:04:53.440> like

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
so no matter whether you rig it like

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.710 
so no matter whether you rig it like
this<00:04:54.070> Texas<00:04:54.370> trips<00:04:54.639> or<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.030> have<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:55.330> on<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.449> jig

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
this Texas trips or you have it on a jig

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.990 
this Texas trips or you have it on a jig
head<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:56.380> works<00:04:56.710> really<00:04:57.009> well<00:04:57.130> especially<00:04:57.729> for

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
head it works really well especially for

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.360 
head it works really well especially for
fast
