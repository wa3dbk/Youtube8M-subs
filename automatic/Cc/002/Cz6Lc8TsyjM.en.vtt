 no no no 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.610
 now 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.220
 the envelope 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.840
 hello shadow fans greets you 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.850
 friendly neighbor shadow I want it to 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.610
 bring them the third edition of who is 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.160
 the most unfortunate where we will analyze 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.559
 two wrestlers or divas of the wwf and 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.750
 determine your achievements and failures in 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.879
 today's edition I decided to devote the two 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.309
 strong fighters and that however they are 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.860
 very lumpy today is his turn 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.050
 great khali against ezequiel jackson well 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.420
 that we are going to give you with the video starting 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.640
 with the great khali as this giant of 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.290
 more than 2 meters high had the best 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.839
 debut that anyone would have liked 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.210
 interrupt a struggle of the undertaker and 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.400
 leave it lying in the ring cali debuting 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.490
 as rude being the first fighter in 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.350
 the Indian in signing with ww her first 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.840
 fights were against funaki and king 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.880
 mysterio cali continued to slaughter the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.400
 gravedigger even in a what you have 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.530
 standing after was sent to the cidob 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.570
 link where it was not your best race there 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.520
 then he was sent to road where 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.560
 would enter a rivalry against the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.720
 champion of the wwf 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.090
 jon fine wanting to be the challenger for the 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.040
 title however losing their struggles 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.200
 for the title before a new dinner 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.390
 in which he returned to smata even where he received 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.190
 the biggest pus of his career being 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.470
 winner of a real battle for 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.570
 determine the new world champion that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.240
 at that time it was done but for a 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.430
 injury left the title vacant cali won 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.560
 the title eliminating batista and cane 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.660
 winning his first and only title up 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.910
 now Cali became one of the worst 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.560
 champions of this title had a 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.900
 defense in the great american bass 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.450
 batista winning by disqualification 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.580
 then in a force jib in 2007 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.649
 would lose the title to batista in a 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.140
 triple threat with king mysterio in the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.600
 Cali fight asked for his revenge in not seeing 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.640
 if in the second fist I saw prison max 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.890
 it was a cage with affiliated bamboo and a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 heap of doors the first fight of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.660
 this guy was where did taker against 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.690
 bits or at least cali created a fight 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.920
 that is not seen much in the ww cali 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.410
 he lost that fight 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.570
 cali was taken out of the wwf to 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.209
 recover from his injuries by returning 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.670
 2008 where he had a rivalry with the big 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.489
 losing show had an opportunity for 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.040
 the title of the wwf against triple h in 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.469
 Summerslam but unable to win after 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.959
 to be a technician defending the gravedigger 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:50.140
 which made me a bad decision 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.420
 last years of cali in the ww were of 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.700
 sergio see unimportant struggles and 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.469
 stupid defeats good at least 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.629
 that had removed people from the royal 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.700
 Nowadays, Caly has a 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.480
 special contract which allows you 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.209
 leave and go back to wwf find 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.549
 recovering from his knees now he 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.829
 touch the morenazo de guyana ezekiel 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.599
 jackson debuted in smata 1 but before 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.189
 had passed through the territory in 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.230
 development teaming with a 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.239
 unknown that I do not care to know your 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.859
 good name going back to his debut in 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.590
 smackdown he did it being the 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.569
 bodyguards of brian kendrick 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.010
 helping him on multiple occasions 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.919
 he even helped kendrick out by 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.709
 the title of the wwf in scrabble max 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.720
 for the title of the wwf at least 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.340
 did something good for manager after 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.859
 they would have a chance for the title 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.290
 in pairs with king leaks against 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.450
 choirs but losing after this jackson 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.799
 was sent to the cidob lihuÃ© of the draft 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.569
 supplementary 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.400
 ezekiel jackson happened to be like 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.739
 william regal and with vladimir 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.840
 forming a group that I really do not know 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.060
 what was it called before that had a 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.670
 rivalry against vladimir koslov being 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.560
 technical but then he was allied with the Russian 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.200
 Ezekiel and Regal betray so 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.450
 only being Jackson and rival the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.060
 morenazo began to massacre the champion of 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.640
 the cristian linen cidob even arriving 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.890
 a royal rumble 2010 a fight for the 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.079
 title however without being able to win 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.209
 during the last show of the link link 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.340
 in a fight with extreme rules 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.739
 jackson manages to win the title of life and 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.139
 Dublin that same night is disabled 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.300
 title exists poor jackson wins the 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.460
 title and the next jackson was sent 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.530
 to smackdown debuting winning to Jimmy 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.199
 wang jian and yet he got injured and not 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.360
 he came back until 2010 when he formed 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.970
 part of the road team in the payment to see 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.100
 from brian rise jackson became a technician 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.740
 again but being sent to smackdown 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.990
 again helped barrett attacking big 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.030
 show forming part of the core for a 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.610
 they had a rivalry against the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.650
 new nexus jackson started to show his 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.810
 disgust against barrett changing to 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.180
 technical and starting a rivalry in the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.190
 that was the middle of the title 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.740
 and winning the title in capitol 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.870
 punishment although that reign was short 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.800
 not even coming to defend him in a 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.630
 payment to see 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.940
 jackson after that he went from 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.160
 to rain and now he's injured now 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.660
 comes the final verdict this time it was 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.210
 difficult to know who was the most 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.759
 unfortunate but this time I'm going with 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.380
 the great chalice is to say a giant that 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.360
 put him in front of the gravedigger and 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.060
 batista being a great destroyer 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.130
 even world champion is downgraded to 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.949
 rain and someone very weak against others 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.530
 same case that so although cary is very 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.660
 limited and has no microphone only 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.699
 because of his height and being rough he could get 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.650
 far in part only ezequiel was 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.220
 unfortunate to be a champion three 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.139
 minutes and goodbye brand of the cidob ya 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.820
 good to two fans here ends the 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.800
 third edition of who is the most 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.750
 miserable many has put in the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.580
 comments to the superstars who 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.340
 they want me to compare but everything to their 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.169
 due time do not forget to comment this 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.030
 video to what they thought and check the 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.349
