a<00:00:04.060> good<00:00:04.990> flight<00:00:05.290> commander<00:00:05.710> will<00:00:05.860> realize

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 
a good flight commander will realize

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.590 
a good flight commander will realize
that<00:00:06.490> the<00:00:06.609> flight<00:00:06.880> falls<00:00:07.149> into<00:00:07.330> line

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
that the flight falls into line

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.930 
that the flight falls into line
formation<00:00:08.049> and<00:00:08.410> should<00:00:09.040> march<00:00:09.280> in<00:00:09.490> column

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
formation and should march in column

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.600 
formation and should march in column
formation<00:00:10.950> therefore<00:00:11.950> they<00:00:12.130> must<00:00:12.280> anticipate

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610

where<00:00:13.120> to<00:00:13.210> fall<00:00:13.450> in<00:00:13.630> the<00:00:13.780> flight<00:00:14.019> so<00:00:14.650> they<00:00:14.769> may

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
where to fall in the flight so they may

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.410 
where to fall in the flight so they may
give<00:00:15.130> the<00:00:15.250> formation<00:00:15.790> a<00:00:15.940> right

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
give the formation a right

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.480 
give the formation a right
