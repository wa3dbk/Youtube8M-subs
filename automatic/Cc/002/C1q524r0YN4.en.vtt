swampy cave it you'll notice that I

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.049 
swampy cave it you'll notice that I
alternate<00:00:10.860> between<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.340> two<00:00:11.460> I'll<00:00:11.790> never

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
alternate between the two I'll never

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.450 
alternate between the two I'll never
take<00:00:12.780> both<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.230> these<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.590> once<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.040> really<00:00:14.340> is

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
take both of these at once it really is

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.029 
take both of these at once it really is
pointless<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.839> very<00:00:16.080> similar<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.800> in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
pointless to the very similar you see in

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.970 
pointless to the very similar you see in
terms<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.520> damage<00:00:18.000> speed<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.840> accuracy<00:00:19.080> so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
terms of damage speed and accuracy so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
terms of damage speed and accuracy so
I'd<00:00:20.279> strongly<00:00:20.609> suggest<00:00:21.119> first<00:00:21.539> thing<00:00:21.720> first

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
I'd strongly suggest first thing first

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
I'd strongly suggest first thing first
take<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> other<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> what

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
take one or the other and this is what

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.390 
take one or the other and this is what

and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:07.619> switch<00:01:07.890> looked<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> dark<00:01:08.729> bow

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
I'm just showing off but there is loads
of<00:01:17.220> combinations<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> can't

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
of combinations you know you can't

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.230 
of combinations you know you can't
choose<00:01:19.040> over<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> shitty<00:01:20.580> spec<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
choose over than the shitty spec that

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.320 
choose over than the shitty spec that
are<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.320> offers<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.830> us<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.970> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
are there it offers for us so you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.670 
are there it offers for us so you
probably<00:01:24.479> thinking<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> now

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
probably thinking is that it now

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
probably thinking is that it now

good<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.200> reality<00:01:46.259> I've<00:01:46.890> tried

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
good there but in reality I've tried

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.789 
good there but in reality I've tried
them<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.460> before<00:01:47.930> yeah<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.380> hit<00:01:49.590> more

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
them out before yeah you do hit more

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
them out before yeah you do hit more
frequently<00:01:50.399> less<00:01:50.850> Eros<00:01:51.360> I'd<00:01:51.600> definitely<00:01:52.049> say

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
frequently less Eros I'd definitely say

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
frequently less Eros I'd definitely say
that<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> never<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.159> close<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.850> max

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that but you never get close to that max

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.569 
that but you never get close to that max
it<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.780> honestly<00:01:54.930> say<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.979> because

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it I can honestly say now and because

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
it I can honestly say now and because
the<00:01:56.820> Carol's<00:01:57.450> bow<00:01:57.630> has<00:01:57.810> got<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> higher<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the Carol's bow has got a higher in a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.980 
the Carol's bow has got a higher in a
range<00:01:59.219> bonus<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.240> tend<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.600> hit<00:02:00.810> more

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
range bonus you do tend to hit more

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.350 
range bonus you do tend to hit more
frequently<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.680> even<00:02:02.100> though<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.729> max<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
frequently so even though the max it is

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
frequently so even though the max it is
just<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.750> between<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.320> two<00:02:04.530> numbers<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
just in between them two numbers it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.700 
just in between them two numbers it
works<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.360> better<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.960> I'd<00:02:07.079> say<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> you
