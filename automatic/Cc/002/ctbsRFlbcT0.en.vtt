 so that the zombie count would like as much as possible 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.820
 more people

 mirror case when herself 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.510
 copying is not something that is not subject to change 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.460
 they are, on the contrary, encouraged ober bodies 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.590
 not an exception 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.980
 and because of this the game can be called not 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.780
 only an outstanding phenomenon among 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 representatives of the genre of shooters but 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.190
 significant event for 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.800
 connoisseurs 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.340
 good zone 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.970
 although in terms of gameplay 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.580
 released new site 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.580
 will be different from its predecessor 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.430
 the style of the game will make gamers 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 believe 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.230

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.050
 tradition of the series the plot usb disk allotted 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.570
 much more time than before Yakutsk and 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.280
 almost every scene consists of jokes mat 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.900
 and explosions watching the development of the story 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.340
 turns out to be surprisingly interesting 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 both assets 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.910
 there is no one

 firing from the zone 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.570
 passage difficult to lose at least

 half full life 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.260
 face meets samovar know what 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
 waiting before attack and putting 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.710
 Plus, death in markels will not 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.360
 reason to start passing level 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.760
 again 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.830
 inspected 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.880
 they make the game probably the easiest 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.720
 representatives of the once formidable 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.850
 series 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.850

 passage director scud 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.959
 we will run into a lot more crowds 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.760
 zombie 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.050
 with new mutants and the need 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.860
 catch the eye 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.969
 first aid kits as 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.129
 continued directorial versions 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.409
 not 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.790

 improved already available if 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.060
 thereafter 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.830
 game complexity will seem too 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.159
 low 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.839
 meaning open mode 2 remote in which 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.120
 giner shoot with two hands as if 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.889
 corrected by two heroes at once but with 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.909
 this example as 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.259
 besides low 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.069
 disadvantages of the game suggests itself and 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.359
 the technical side of the issue of vacation and 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.599
 character models and zombies are far from 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.309
 perfect 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.959
 what is before each meeting 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.389
 olga moment of signing serious 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.349
 lack of time course y 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.389
 you stop turning him 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.019
 however at first 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.549
 slowing down from annoying and interfere
