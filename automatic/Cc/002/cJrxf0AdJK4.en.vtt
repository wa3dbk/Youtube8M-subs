of<00:02:01.090> sand<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.829> then<00:02:02.979> they've<00:02:03.159> got<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.520> where<00:02:03.700> it

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
of sand and then they've got it where it

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.660 
of sand and then they've got it where it
kind<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.119> carries<00:02:05.049> into<00:02:05.350> his<00:02:05.619> his<00:02:05.979> leg<00:02:06.310> here

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
kind of carries into his his leg here

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.529 
kind of carries into his his leg here
and<00:02:06.700> then<00:02:06.850> kind<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.299> fades<00:02:07.749> off<00:02:08.050> but<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:10.450> not

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
and then kind of fades off but it's not

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.210 
and then kind of fades off but it's not
bad<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.200> then<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.470> course<00:02:11.530> they've<00:02:11.890> got<00:02:12.069> that

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
bad and then of course they've got that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.580 
bad and then of course they've got that
in<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.430> hand<00:02:12.730> as<00:02:12.910> well<00:02:13.090> there's<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.660> lot<00:02:14.440> of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
in the hand as well there's a lot of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.430 
in the hand as well there's a lot of
detail<00:02:14.980> going<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> hands<00:02:16.140> both<00:02:17.140> hands

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
detail going on in the hands both hands

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.949 
detail going on in the hands both hands
actually<00:02:17.680> because<00:02:18.190> he<00:02:18.310> does<00:02:18.490> have<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:21.959> prote

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
actually because he does have to prote

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.230 
actually because he does have to prote
now<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.670> good<00:02:24.850> good<00:02:25.300> parts<00:02:25.570> aside<00:02:26.820> my<00:02:27.820> gripe

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
now I the good good parts aside my gripe

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.790 
now I the good good parts aside my gripe
with<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.510> toy

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
with the toy

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.160 
with the toy
and<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.460> think<00:02:30.880> looking<00:02:31.360> at<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.840> can<00:02:31.870> kind

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
and I think looking at it you can kind

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.990 
and I think looking at it you can kind
of<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.500> get<00:02:32.770> an<00:02:32.920> idea<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.670> would<00:02:33.790> be

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
of get get an idea of what it would be

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.620 
of get get an idea of what it would be
is<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:35.100> he<00:02:36.100> has<00:02:36.280> articulation<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.390> legs

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
is that he has articulation in the legs

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.980 
is that he has articulation in the legs
in<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.860> arms<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.580> then<00:02:40.210> in<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.450> shoulders

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
in the arms and then in the shoulders

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.140 
in the arms and then in the shoulders
and<00:02:41.340> then<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.520> course<00:02:42.550> in<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:42.910> head<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:43.930> I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
and then of course in the head but I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.060 
and then of course in the head but I
just<00:02:46.150> don't<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.990> they<00:02:47.140> always<00:02:47.320> resort

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
just don't like that they always resort

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.410 
just don't like that they always resort
to<00:02:48.300> putting<00:02:49.300> these<00:02:49.420> figures<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.080> statues<00:02:51.420> if

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
to putting these figures and statues if

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.910 
to putting these figures and statues if
you<00:02:52.720> saw<00:02:52.930> my<00:02:53.110> review<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:54.220> dr.<00:02:55.150> Octavius

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
figure which is right here he's got that

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.150 
figure which is right here he's got that
same<00:03:00.370> problem<00:03:00.730> now<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.120> know<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:02.620> still<00:03:02.680> give

just it's a shame that they it's a shame
that<00:03:09.490> they're<00:03:09.850> more<00:03:10.060> concerned<00:03:10.720> with<00:03:10.900> doing<00:03:11.020> a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
that they're more concerned with doing a

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.960 
that they're more concerned with doing a
gimmick<00:03:11.590> on<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.770> toy<00:03:12.040> than<00:03:12.370> they<00:03:12.490> are<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
gimmick on a toy than they are on the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.060 
gimmick on a toy than they are on the
actual<00:03:13.270> articulation<00:03:14.080> what<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.590> would<00:03:14.920> have

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
actual articulation what I would have

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.620 
actual articulation what I would have
liked<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.550> have<00:03:15.670> seen<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.270> know<00:03:16.330> it's

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
liked to have seen and I know it's

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.390 
liked to have seen and I know it's
probably<00:03:16.690> asking<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.380> lot<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:18.250> would<00:03:18.370> have

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
probably asking a lot is it would have

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.730 
probably asking a lot is it would have
been<00:03:18.550> nice<00:03:18.730> maybe<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.450> keep<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:20.200> torso

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the figure but it just would have been

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.610 
the figure but it just would have been
nice<00:03:49.450> if<00:03:49.510> they<00:03:49.840> could<00:03:49.989> have<00:03:50.110> given<00:03:50.260> him<00:03:50.500> a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
nice if they could have given him a

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.000 
nice if they could have given him a
little<00:03:50.860> more<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:51.489> he's<00:03:51.640> he's<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.270> not<00:03:52.660> like<00:03:52.690> a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
little more so he's he's just not like a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.510 
little more so he's he's just not like a
block<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.220> plastic<00:03:54.730> kind<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.030> thing<00:03:56.520> speaking

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
block of plastic kind of thing speaking

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.250 
block of plastic kind of thing speaking
of<00:03:57.700> gimmicks<00:03:58.209> though<00:03:58.450> there's<00:03:58.959> a<00:03:59.050> little

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
of gimmicks though there's a little

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.830 
of gimmicks though there's a little
lever<00:03:59.560> on<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.860> back<00:04:00.160> here<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:01.300> idea<00:04:01.600> is<00:04:01.690> when

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
lever on the back here the idea is when

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.070 
lever on the back here the idea is when
you<00:04:01.870> raise<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.190> up<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.790> I'm<00:04:04.420> surprised<00:04:04.840> it's

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
you raise that up and I'm surprised it's

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.020 
you raise that up and I'm surprised it's
up<00:04:05.320> instead<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.010> down<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.610> would<00:04:06.730> think<00:04:06.970> that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
up instead of down you would think that

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.220 
up instead of down you would think that
the<00:04:07.209> switch<00:04:07.450> would<00:04:07.570> be<00:04:07.720> up<00:04:07.810> here<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.170> you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
the switch would be up here and you

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.530 
the switch would be up here and you
would<00:04:08.380> just<00:04:08.640> push<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.790> with<00:04:09.910> your<00:04:10.060> thumb<00:04:10.330> but

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
would just push it with your thumb but

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.780 
would just push it with your thumb but
this<00:04:10.720> one<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:10.930> actually<00:04:11.110> have<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.650> lift<00:04:12.520> up

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
this one you actually have to lift up

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.650 
this one you actually have to lift up
and<00:04:13.060> when<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.959> lift<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.530> his<00:04:14.830> hand<00:04:15.510> flip<00:04:16.510> it

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
and when you lift it his hand flip it

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.370 
and when you lift it his hand flip it
around<00:04:16.720> here<00:04:17.020> his<00:04:17.200> hand<00:04:17.530> just<00:04:18.400> does<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:19.380> don't

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
around here his hand just does a I don't

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.930 
around here his hand just does a I don't
know

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
know

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.840 
know
bitch-slap<00:04:25.350> feature<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:26.560> guess<00:04:26.860> that's<00:04:27.760> the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
bitch-slap feature I guess that's the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.930 
bitch-slap feature I guess that's the
best<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:28.240> describe<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:30.460> doesn't<00:04:30.640> do<00:04:30.850> it

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
best I can describe it it doesn't do it

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.120 
best I can describe it it doesn't do it
on<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.180> hand<00:04:31.450> this<00:04:31.780> hand<00:04:31.870> does<00:04:32.260> have<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.560> at

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
on this hand this hand does have the at

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.270 
on this hand this hand does have the at
least<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.610> articulation<00:04:34.360> in<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.810> in<00:04:35.290> the

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
least the articulation in the in the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.400 
least the articulation in the in the
elbows<00:04:36.730> here<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.300> mean<00:04:37.480> this<00:04:37.600> one<00:04:37.780> does<00:04:37.960> too<00:04:38.200> but

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
elbows here I mean this one does too but

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.040 
elbows here I mean this one does too but
then<00:04:38.740> you've<00:04:38.890> just<00:04:38.919> got<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.190> straight<00:04:39.550> arm<00:04:40.050> this

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
then you've just got a straight arm this

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.730 
then you've just got a straight arm this
hand<00:04:41.470> also<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:41.950> can<00:04:42.190> take<00:04:42.370> off

I just wish though that I don't know I
just<00:05:26.409> wish<00:05:26.710> that<00:05:26.919> they<00:05:27.069> could<00:05:27.099> have<00:05:27.280> had<00:05:27.400> a

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
just wish that they could have had a

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.439 
just wish that they could have had a
regular<00:05:28.270> set<00:05:28.659> of<00:05:28.750> legs<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.259> guy<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:30.449> maybe

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
regular set of legs on the guy and maybe

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.649 
regular set of legs on the guy and maybe
have<00:05:31.870> a<00:05:32.229> ball<00:05:33.069> socket<00:05:33.669> articulation<00:05:34.449> in<00:05:34.569> the

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
have a ball socket articulation in the

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:35.879 
have a ball socket articulation in the
shoulder<00:05:35.110> so<00:05:35.229> you<00:05:35.289> can<00:05:35.440> get<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.590> little<00:05:35.740> more

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
shoulder so you can get a little more

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.830 
shoulder so you can get a little more
movement<00:05:36.400> in<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.580> hands<00:05:37.000> have<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.690> can<00:05:37.810> have

movement in the hands have you can have

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.040 
movement in the hands have you can have
the<00:05:38.050> arms<00:05:38.319> down<00:05:38.620> but<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:40.000> don't<00:05:40.539> know<00:05:40.779> I<00:05:40.840> guess

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
the arms down but I don't know I guess

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.200 
the arms down but I don't know I guess
they're<00:05:41.259> small<00:05:41.529> gripes<00:05:41.830> for<00:05:42.219> for<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:42.969> fact

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
they're small gripes for for the fact

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.180 
they're small gripes for for the fact
that<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.539> is<00:05:43.659> based<00:05:43.900> on<00:05:44.139> a<00:05:44.430> kid's<00:05:45.430> cartoon<00:05:45.960> but

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
that it is based on a kid's cartoon but

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.260 
that it is based on a kid's cartoon but
at<00:05:48.190> any<00:05:48.370> rate<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:49.389> a<00:05:49.479> good<00:05:49.659> figure<00:05:51.150> there<00:05:52.150> you

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
at any rate it's a good figure there you

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.769 
at any rate it's a good figure there you
have<00:05:52.479> it

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
have it

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.659 
have it
