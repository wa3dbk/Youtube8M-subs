00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello guys 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.220
 In this video lesson I want to introduce you to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.380
 you more of an equipment of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
 an investigation widely used by 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 private detectives 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 as I already said the new technologies 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.270
 available in the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.740
 counter-espionage facilitates the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.140
 detective work 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.930
 In this video lesson you will know a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.680
 vehicle tracking systems 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.990
 existing in the market of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.630
 counter-espionage this equipment is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.270
 operated by the GPS system that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 allows you to locate in real time the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 vehicle of a person who is being 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 investigated by us 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.329
 There are several types of GPS available 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.879
 in the market mainly to protect 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.149
 against theft but most of them 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.070
 requires technical training beyond time 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.219
 necessary for its installation in the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.680
 our case the gps for the work of us 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.899
 inform where the vehicle of the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.570
 person investigated without having to 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.579
 spend the whole day following there is something out there 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.100
 then a vehicle with the traffic of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.680
 today is an arduous task and very 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 demanding and demanding 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.970
 and the patience of the detective 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.210
 the other problem during the segment 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 a vehicle is safety and description that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.040
 must be observed at all times to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.140
 that the target does not realize that it is being 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.509
 followed by this tracking equipment 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.729
 vehicles that have my hands is one of the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.700
 best equipment I've ever known 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.500
 its installation is quick and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.920
 durability of transmission of 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.040
 information can last from 30 to 60 days 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.170
 without having to recharge the same 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.180
 this equipment has another 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.700
 very important feature 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.460
 it can be installed anywhere 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 either inside the vehicle or down 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.750
 the same 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.340
 he owns four super- sisters 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.710
 that help you learn in any 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.990
 iron surface without running the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.540
 risk losing it another very detail 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.710
 important in this crawler is your 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.229
 operation 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.750
 your system uses the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.000
 gsm mobile phones 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 simply insert a chip of any 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.240
 and make a connection to the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.580
 even in two minutes 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.250
 the maximum and send the reply with the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.710
 exact location and positioning of the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.780
 vehicle now the detective does not need 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.970
 more standing all day in the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.120
 your vehicle waiting for something to come out 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.310
 then simply plant the tracker on the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.570
 album vehicle investigated expect the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.850
 even moving 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.610
 monitoring can be done 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.880
 anywhere in your office from your

 laptop a tablet or mobile phone with internet 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.570
 and ready you want to know a little more 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.210
 on this equipment your 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.260
 operation in the course of 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.300
 private detective 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.820
 Let's teach you how to operate this 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.960
 equipment and how to install it without 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.270
 no one understands 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.550
 now enroll in the course 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.650
 detective and take advantage of 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.990
 know other equipment of 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.720
 counter-espionage used by 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.410
 detectives and I hope 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.410
