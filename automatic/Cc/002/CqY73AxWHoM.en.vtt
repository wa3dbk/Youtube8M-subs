model<00:04:31.590> dialogue<00:04:35.449> and<00:04:37.130> then<00:04:38.130> another<00:04:38.430> div<00:04:38.669> tag

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
model dialogue and then another div tag

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:46.879 
model dialogue and then another div tag
with<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.259> class<00:04:40.349> of<00:04:42.050> model<00:04:44.780> content<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.080> this

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
content for our model okay no model

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.120 
content for our model okay no model
contains<00:04:56.280> header<00:04:56.789> body<00:04:57.509> and<00:04:57.810> fuller<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.889> let's

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
contains header body and fuller so let's

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.480 
contains header body and fuller so let's
just<00:04:59.310> define<00:04:59.460> three<00:04:59.789> different<00:05:00.090> tags<00:05:01.490> the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
just define three different tags the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.700 
just define three different tags the
first<00:05:02.699> one<00:05:02.910> will<00:05:03.060> be<00:05:03.090> model<00:05:04.520> header<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:06.710> will

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
first one will be model header I will

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.379 
first one will be model header I will
have<00:05:07.889> our<00:05:08.039> h2<00:05:08.430> tag<00:05:08.639> in<00:05:08.820> my<00:05:08.910> model<00:05:09.210> header

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
have our h2 tag in my model header

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:16.879 
have our h2 tag in my model header
saying<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.759> terms<00:05:12.919> and<00:05:14.690> conditions<00:05:15.889> okay

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
saying that terms and conditions okay

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.350 
saying that terms and conditions okay
and<00:05:17.360> then<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.599> will<00:05:18.810> define<00:05:19.409> my<00:05:21.289> model<00:05:22.289> body

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
and then I will define my model body

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.050 
and then I will define my model body
with<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.990> div<00:05:25.440> tag<00:05:25.710> with<00:05:26.039> a<00:05:26.340> class<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.789> model

text will go here

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.720 
text will go here
you<00:05:37.330> can<00:05:37.510> either<00:05:37.660> define<00:05:38.050> a<00:05:38.260> form<00:05:38.800> within<00:05:39.550> a

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
you can either define a form within a

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.560 
you can either define a form within a
model<00:05:40.060> as<00:05:40.180> well<00:05:40.390> so<00:05:41.170> it's<00:05:41.860> up<00:05:42.100> to<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.400> so<00:05:43.060> now<00:05:43.540> I

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
will define a model footer okay and

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.650 
will define a model footer okay and
model<00:05:49.840> for<00:05:49.990> I<00:05:50.170> will<00:05:50.290> simply<00:05:50.470> create<00:05:50.920> a<00:05:50.950> button

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
model for I will simply create a button

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.420 
model for I will simply create a button
which<00:05:52.660> will<00:05:52.900> close<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:53.320> mold<00:05:53.470> model<00:05:54.010> then<00:05:54.310> we

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
which will close the mold model then we

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.690 
which will close the mold model then we
will<00:05:54.550> click<00:05:54.730> that<00:05:54.940> button<00:05:56.130> so<00:05:57.130> I'll<00:05:58.090> say<00:05:58.420> type

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
will click that button so I'll say type

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:07.970 
will click that button so I'll say type
button'<00:06:00.700> class<00:06:03.660> could<00:06:04.660> be<00:06:04.770> beauty<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:05.950> BTN

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
button' class could be beauty and BTN

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:16.670 
button' class could be beauty and BTN
primary<00:06:10.680> and<00:06:13.050> data<00:06:14.050> dismissed<00:06:14.890> attribute

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
primary and data dismissed attribute

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.470 
primary and data dismissed attribute
will<00:06:17.680> be<00:06:17.830> equal<00:06:18.070> to<00:06:18.100> model<00:06:18.610> so<00:06:18.910> when<00:06:19.030> we<00:06:19.240> click

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
will be equal to model so when we click

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.560 
will be equal to model so when we click
this<00:06:19.660> button<00:06:19.720> it<00:06:20.470> will<00:06:20.680> dismiss<00:06:21.040> the<00:06:21.280> model<00:06:21.670> so
