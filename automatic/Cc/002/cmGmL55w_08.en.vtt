00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.689
 today we do a bloody mary and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.689
 it is intended to, we do it with all 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.830
 very fresh tomato juice the hammer 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.730
 juice is now about twelve 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:40.570
 minutes ago what you see below is 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.940
 That's why sometimes it's one of those 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.180
 beautiful transparent tomato foam 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.950
 the puma gets clear tomato soup 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.670
 there is a bad master played 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.920
 But almost everything here is the one 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.449
 taste that's intents because it's not 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.980
 the time you have that such a pull to 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.649
 let's not because of that now 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.480
 Wanting to be through some towels 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.789
 just to keep this clear 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.770
 At the time, being brutal does not look 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.830
 if a little bit sensitive since we 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 I like to hear that and that 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.900
 was it there is already in shape again 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.970
 what comes next we make a bloody 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.530
 Mary and no drink of this world 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.850
 so many around so much 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.860
 maybe once tasted too 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.240
 partners also manage to do that, but he does 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.850
 is pretty far ahead bloody 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.950
 Mary is an absolute 1 in itself 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.180
 a miracle is not everything, so to speak 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.720
 sound bitter 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.880
 one has acids as sweet one has sharpness 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 one has salty it down it is 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.330
 treatment of s 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.330
 Cocktails all very fantastic we 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.650
 make it so that we see what you see here 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 now only by it so to speak 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.229
 just was so fresh and juicy 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.460
 you have really strong here 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.650
 because of this the foam will be 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.880
 tomato juice always stirred and then 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.760
 not shaken 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.800
 so to speak, so to speak 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.660
 this clear beautiful image upright 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.600
 receive 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.750
 Let's make it all up to us 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.470
 on the tomato juice shake it already 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.480
 cold is mixed and then stir 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.950
 start this under the tomato juice 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.440
 small feature still in the bloody 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.410
 Mary as we are doing right now 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.270
 this is actually one, so to speak 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.660
 old variant we choose to take with you 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.570
 gin so you always know each other with vodka 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.150
 we take you with jam and otherwise 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.500
 Let's stay with the classic recipe 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.110
 as often practiced with 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.810
 personal 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.840
 from the highest of the bartenders presidency 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.460
 can bring in his character 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.680
 Every time I like that, I especially like it 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:06.520
 like half a lemon juice 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:14.030
 then we have the chance a bit 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:20.920
 strong men are with tabasco in 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:25.970
 although really very reserved 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.910
 A little salt should mean one again 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.100
 nice rock salt are more salt to it 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.610
 bring that character there as well 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.080
 People who prefer something like celery 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.670
 salt how to do it and then come 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:48.290
 to 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:52.190
 something sharper that should be enough and around 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.630
 the character of the cherry tomatoes something to 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.170
 emphasize and the sweet 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.660
 we have to play as a secret weapon 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.130
 something cherry looks powerful now 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.690
 one is hot and we have each other now 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.470
 opted for hennig screen 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.780
 thought to have grasped at worse 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.220
 who also played with castle comes 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 So tomato is actually very clear 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.450
 so more or less that's ours 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.610
 horticultural understanding 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.770
 full of drinks customers have it 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.520
 done so now 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:33.550
 we would be fine strain the same 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:35.020
 Small samples could really be here 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.180
 just wear the sash which are rare 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.120
 In the skin is actually always because it 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.110
 yes a sweetie a bit sweet 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.479
 really sharp these are the little ones 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:59.590
 Kernel the homebase really out 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:05:03.960
 but always give for the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:12.900
 Feinstein then work with the 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:12.900
 proven chess coach and with the team 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.200
 Unfortunately it could not be like now 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.540
 Politically for a cloud of tomato 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.430
 with over all the time that's it 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:42.110
 somehow already a gift I think 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:58.000
 so now for the finest we lift 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:58.000
 now a little bit down then wants to 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.480
 Now we give the vettel because he 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.710
 would rather the whole team rather 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:12.290
 have runners clog if that 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.470
 Mix of classic red pepper 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:18.650
 yes, always such a nice sweet black 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:22.810
 otherwise we have a relatively mild 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.610
 still the white of the tightened and 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.000
 give it back a bit 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.520
 blurring with it purely gives people the 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.030
 do celery stem in there and can 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.330
 group disc throw in meter 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.330
 draufpacken 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.380
 bye 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.020
 O
