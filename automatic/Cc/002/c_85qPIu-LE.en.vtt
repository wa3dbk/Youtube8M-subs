00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.080
 we come across a lot of a lot of personality and then I have a lot of 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.599
 things to say a lot about me and it's true that for the flowers 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.599
 still obviously the world of childhood year she knows s never 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.179
 very very push 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.599
 obviously stéphane clerget would be better placed to ride since 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.599
 time tell it all the good that we think 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.579
 obviously the 36 years old in the summer 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.790
 almost without hesitation so I'm proud it's because I think they 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.710
 trust me and then yesterday and then we have some who have 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.090
 to refuse because their children it was was too painful is not in 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.840
 force what is interesting is that we understand a lot about 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.390
 they are getting to know him 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.420
 all these popular people it goes from jean-pierre foucault michel galabru 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.410
 mariam he likes it's worth more dead of frank dubost finally here's what to eat 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.610
 and I wanted to take the people I loved 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.600
 it is that the public likes since a long time but I think that one learns 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.700
 also to get to know each other better and understand each other better with the web 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 decryption of stéphane clerget 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.720
 losses on loans and fines already for example we learn that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.250
 marianne this anorexic address 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.360
 and at unesco and he wanted me to be a native of bourgois their son hugo lloris 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.200
 and vermeer we could think that the opposite so we discover a michel 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.610
 galabru hours% the day before 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.710
 many lots of ungrateful records india hence their fate and michel galabru 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.149
 obviously the nasdaq fell by almost 10% 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.630
 % and we rediscover it 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.650
 in the corridors uprooting part by Morocco and leaving the new 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.909
 game which was actually a big scandal of someone who all knows that the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.909
 first years of his life 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.020
 so this is a big story book for all contracts for all 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.329
 contract parents 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.560
 percent because it's true that it's philippe bouvard who was at 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.380
 kankan not try to solve politics 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.320
 I have nothing against it in the past 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.159
 and if it's a roof he missed it he was nice 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.390
 he was good he was otherwise health status was evolving well closed 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.869
 where he was completely unsuited to school 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.149
 philippe bouvard was not far from that of the Germans jose garcia then 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.379
 likewise maybe part of her origins and her parents she 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.359
 who came from Spain 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.180
 he understood nothing advanced if it's so it's jam and elie wiesel 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.650
 high doses 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 % and then there are all these people have come out terribly 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:27.529
 I do not want to 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:31.199
 dede to draw conclusions left the team was a little bit of 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.619
 typology counter what I preferred to appeal to an agreement what is 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.289
 realistic this part really allows readers of power 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.710
 maybe understand his own children because 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.750
 in adolescence for example that is a period still very complicated if 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.750
 we receive bets to perform small things is not bad 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.130
 however serge lama for a period 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.610
 % not to tell a fact that is very proud that is funny because it 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.320
 was three four years old and it was kindergarten terror because he 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.470
 stung the buttocks of his classmates and girls with 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.830
 pins to wipe his specialty to the sea so obviously there has been 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.470
 full of moms not dead 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.940
 it was a little bit far and it was very small not learning that 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.879
 him in the conversation 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.669
 10 I would like to say good I'm not very proud but I'd like to 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.199
 have an explanation what can it mean so there they have a 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.159
 identity a quick little explanation but with the air I think we wanted 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.839
 in the audience and it's not for specialists 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.839
 and for the ports the moment with his centenary 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.019
 so we can not be yet 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.639
 to the complexity and to get out of the stagnation and mireuil to keep in 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.870
 any case succeed in his passion is a book too that gives 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.349
 hope in five years without doing
