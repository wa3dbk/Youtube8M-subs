overview of common joint problems today
we're<00:00:11.190> focusing<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.150> back<00:00:12.809> legs<00:00:13.160> so<00:00:14.160> the

we're focusing on the back legs so the

we're focusing on the back legs so the
back<00:00:14.969> legs<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.599> would<00:00:15.900> say<00:00:16.320> receive<00:00:16.650> more<00:00:16.920> than

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
back legs I would say receive more than

back legs I would say receive more than
their<00:00:17.400> fair<00:00:17.760> share<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.449> daughter<00:00:19.080> throws<00:00:19.470> and

the most common disease we see in the

the most common disease we see in the

good set of posts on this on my blog
it's<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.800> common<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.660> essentially<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it's very common and essentially it is a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's very common and essentially it is a
looseness<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> hips<00:00:42.230> mainly<00:00:43.230> seen<00:00:43.440> in

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
looseness of the hips mainly seen in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
looseness of the hips mainly seen in
large<00:00:43.739> dogs<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.870> it's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.200> result<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:47.270> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
large dogs and it's a result of the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.709 
large dogs and it's a result of the
muscles<00:00:48.840> being<00:00:49.559> unable<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> support<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
muscles being unable to support the

muscles being unable to support the
extra<00:00:52.140> large<00:00:52.289> bones<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.489> growing<00:00:54.120> dogs<00:00:54.390> in

extra large bones of growing dogs in

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.200 
extra large bones of growing dogs in
this<00:00:55.350> creates<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.860> laxity<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> looseness<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this creates a laxity or a looseness in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.479 
this creates a laxity or a looseness in
the<00:00:57.300> hip<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:58.140> creates<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.920> banging

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the hip which creates a lot of banging

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.389 
the hip which creates a lot of banging
around<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.300> hip<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.350> fracture<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
around and hip and you get fracture of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.320 
around and hip and you get fracture of
the<00:01:02.430> cartilage<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.270> you'll<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.199> arthritis

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
the cartilage and you'll get arthritis

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.310 
the cartilage and you'll get arthritis
sometimes<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.450> didn't<00:01:06.630> show<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> until<00:01:07.170> quite

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
sometimes I didn't show it until quite

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.460 
sometimes I didn't show it until quite
later<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> life<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:09.119> they've<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.600> they

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
later in life but if they've got it they

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.140 
later in life but if they've got it they
will<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.799> arthritis<00:01:11.070> later<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.700> life

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

arthritis the knee joint is similar to
our<00:01:45.200> own<00:01:45.380> joint<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.299> in<00:01:47.299> my<00:01:47.539> opinion<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:48.110> a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
our own joint and in my opinion is a

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.219 
our own joint and in my opinion is a

very badly designed joint it's prone to
a<00:01:51.259> lot<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.560> fillings<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.819> most<00:01:53.060> common<00:01:53.479> of

a lot of fillings and the most common of

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.499 
a lot of fillings and the most common of
these<00:01:53.929> is<00:01:54.319> a<00:01:54.860> rupture<00:01:55.789> of<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:56.000> cruciate

these is a rupture of the cruciate

these is a rupture of the cruciate

everybody knows somebody that has had
surgery<00:02:10.700> on<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.540> at<00:02:11.780> some<00:02:11.930> point<00:02:12.230> and

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
surgery on the at some point and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.280 
surgery on the at some point and
probably<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.840> doctor<00:02:15.200> your
