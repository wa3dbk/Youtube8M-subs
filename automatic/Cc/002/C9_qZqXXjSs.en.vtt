 left from scratch the early 80s bettiche the moors managed to 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.240
 develop a brand new four-wheel drive car designed to 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.689
 run in group b 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.039
 there lbg subway if these brawls 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.749
 if this car is vaguely related to the basic metro at 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.259
 traction and engine before that is only by some aspects of its 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:19.210
 life 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.439
 its design owes a lot to formula 1 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.149
 the chassis and the 4-wheel drive system are the fruit of grand williams 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.329
 price engineering and as evening what is deeply involved in the 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.759
 v6 development 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.079
 once completed the design phase bristish the moors sort of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.539

 420 horsepower products 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.020
 competitive at the time of its creation, it is nevertheless unable to evolve 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.280
 and compete with rivals at the turbo-compressed 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.550
 in constant evolution 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.780
 but the next baptized version if these investment knitting sharks 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.360
 only more powerful it is also more flexible 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.800
 it is easier to fly than the turbulent model 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.060
 turbocharged 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.690
 even after the disappearance of group b in 1986, it will continue to win 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.090
 races at the regional level he's even continuing to do it today 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.890
 it has become endowed with a very powerful chassis the ssii serves only to type

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.850

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.020
 and misunderstanding within the team
