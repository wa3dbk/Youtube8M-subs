00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.420 
that's important yeah this is this is
exactly<00:01:31.660> what<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.140> shouldn't<00:01:32.500> do<00:01:32.680> because<00:01:33.310> if

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
exactly what you shouldn't do because if

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.130 
exactly what you shouldn't do because if
you<00:01:33.460> eat<00:01:33.730> this<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.480> you<00:01:34.570> bite<00:01:34.780> into<00:01:34.930> this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
you eat this and you bite into this

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.900 
you eat this and you bite into this
you're<00:01:35.440> basically<00:01:35.470> gonna<00:01:36.010> die<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.580> want

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
you're basically gonna die so you want

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.100 
you're basically gonna die so you want
to<00:01:37.000> make<00:01:37.120> sure<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.420> everything's<00:01:37.840> really

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
to make sure that everything's really

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.690 
to make sure that everything's really
finely<00:01:38.500> chopped<00:01:38.740> not<00:01:38.980> like<00:01:39.160> cement<00:01:39.430> boss

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
finely chopped not like cement boss

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.520 
finely chopped not like cement boss
there's<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.390> way<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.540> poison<00:01:40.870> your<00:01:41.170> husband

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
there's a way to poison your husband

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.850 
there's a way to poison your husband
that's<00:01:41.830> two<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> pork<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:44.290> I<00:01:44.350> have<00:01:44.620> like

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
that's two for the pork so I have like

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.920 
that's two for the pork so I have like
little<00:01:45.040> one-inch<00:01:45.400> tubes<00:01:45.880> here<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.330> think<00:01:46.810> it's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
little one-inch tubes here I think it's

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.150 
little one-inch tubes here I think it's
a<00:01:46.990> little<00:01:47.110> too<00:01:47.230> big<00:01:47.470> because<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.770> want<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:47.980> cook

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
a little too big because I want to cook

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.010 
a little too big because I want to cook
this<00:01:48.340> faster<00:01:48.730> kind<00:01:48.940> of<00:01:49.000> like<00:01:49.120> a<00:01:49.150> stir-fry<00:01:49.630> and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
this faster kind of like a stir-fry and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.840 
this faster kind of like a stir-fry and
if<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.260> find<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.560> heat<00:01:50.740> too<00:01:51.130> much<00:01:51.160> they<00:01:51.700> can

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
if you find the heat too much they can

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.820 
if you find the heat too much they can
always<00:01:51.970> add<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.480> little<00:01:53.050> bit<00:01:53.320> of<00:01:53.350> sugar<00:01:53.530> a

always add a little bit of sugar a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.880 
always add a little bit of sugar a
little<00:01:54.600> ginger<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.930> then<00:01:56.050> finally<00:01:56.470> for<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
little ginger and then finally for the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.590 
little ginger and then finally for the
scallops<00:01:57.280> very<00:01:57.610> simple<00:01:58.030> enough<00:01:58.300> what<00:01:58.510> I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
scallops very simple enough what I'm

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.910 
scallops very simple enough what I'm
gonna<00:01:58.720> do<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.140> just<00:01:59.170> season<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.680> with<00:01:59.770> some

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
gonna do is just season it with some

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.500 
gonna do is just season it with some
salt<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.250> we're<00:02:00.670> gonna<00:02:00.760> fry<00:02:00.940> this<00:02:01.000> separately

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
salt and we're gonna fry this separately

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.610 
salt and we're gonna fry this separately
from<00:02:01.630> everything<00:02:02.020> else<00:02:02.170> because<00:02:02.410> we<00:02:02.500> just

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
from everything else because we just

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.740 
from everything else because we just
really<00:02:02.950> want<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.160> retain<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:04.000> beauty<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.480> the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
really want to retain the beauty of the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.780 
really want to retain the beauty of the
first<00:02:04.990> hour<00:02:05.200> okay<00:02:05.950> no<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.580> could<00:02:06.760> be

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
first hour okay no it could be

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.419 
first hour okay no it could be
lemongrass<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.740> cut<00:02:08.980> it<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.130> really

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
lemongrass so if you cut it you really

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.100 
lemongrass so if you cut it you really
have<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.640> mince<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.000> really<00:02:10.300> thinly<00:02:10.630> but<00:02:10.990> this

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
have to mince it really thinly but this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.690 
have to mince it really thinly but this
is<00:02:11.260> better<00:02:11.440> since<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.920> just<00:02:12.010> was<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.310> slavery

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
is better since you just was in slavery

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.190 
is better since you just was in slavery
