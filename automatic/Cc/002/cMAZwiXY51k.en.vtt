00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.760 
overall it's just a nice skin just like
most<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.620> skins<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.100> reveal<00:02:02.400> I<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.770> just

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
most the skins I reveal I like it I just

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
most the skins I reveal I like it I just
did<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.040> cheap<00:02:05.460> bone<00:02:05.610> over<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:05.940> against

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
did a cheap bone over there against

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.520 
did a cheap bone over there against
Batman<00:02:06.630> um<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:08.310> guess<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:10.050> only<00:02:10.260> way<00:02:10.380> this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
Batman um I guess the the only way this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.870 
Batman um I guess the the only way this
could<00:02:10.680> be<00:02:10.800> better<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.040> if<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.310> actual<00:02:11.520> people

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
could be better is if the actual people

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.660 
could be better is if the actual people
at<00:02:12.060> DC<00:02:12.480> made<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.260> know<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.980> suit<00:02:14.280> better

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
at DC made you know the suit better

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.330 
at DC made you know the suit better
maybe<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.570> gave<00:02:15.810> him<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.590> mask<00:02:16.830> cover<00:02:17.100> like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
maybe like gave him the mask cover like

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.310 
maybe like gave him the mask cover like
Batman<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.390> personally<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.200> like
