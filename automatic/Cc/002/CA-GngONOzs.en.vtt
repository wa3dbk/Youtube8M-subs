00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.650
 good friends, I hope it was 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.710
 understood what the spaghetti pilot and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.480
 whenever we sleep on the pejerrey what 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.490
 first that we are going to find is 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.029
 how to do 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.410
 the sliding knot that we are going to serve 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.879
 of silk 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.910
 It is a coil that can be bought in 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.379
 any haberdasher this in this house is 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 lines up with three generations 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.310
 so that you can see well 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.310
 how a new lane is made 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.180
 good and once the pilot 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.870
 the package on the line the first thing that 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.270
 we will find is how to do it 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.600
 That's why I told you that you can do 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.449
 with this thread that is a silk thread that 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.020
 are several strands something like that with a 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.230
 multifilament but 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.900
 of sea would be 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.920
 I just step out a little thing 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.530
 to be able to force 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 What many people ask is whether the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.509
 sliding knot you have to run or not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.580
 you have to run the sliding knot not 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.260
 you have to run 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.310
 is sliding for the purpose of not making a 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.210
 knot about the mother with the mother for 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.460
 prevent it from being cut into a sharp cut 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.460
 and in order to maintain 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.050
 the rotors the buoys and everything 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.960
 contain a firm slipknot or the 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.930
 Sliding knot is really slippery 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 but it has to be firm firm 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.440
 that we have to do force with the nail 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.310
 to be able to run not like we're going to see 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.250
 now 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.740
 it's really a very simple thing to be 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.140
 one correct because we are going to put 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.670
 align the mother's nylon 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.840
 with 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.840
 in this case if you wish 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.980
 let's make a loop 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.620
 do not worry if you lock yourself up so 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.750
 nothing happens 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.549
 the thing is that we do not ride in the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.549
 back then we started a 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.160
 two 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.280
 3 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.460
 4 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.400
 five or more times you know 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.770
 the only thing we did is to make a loop and 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.770
 pass the round by 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.090
 we pull the two ends 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.090
 and there will be a perfect barrel 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.709
 initiated 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.709
 sometimes we put him 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.410
 it looks good there 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.920
 once we have the new slide 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.980
 Already done 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.640
 when you put in euros plus what 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.640
 I have in hand 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.260
 we continue well and tighten the knot well 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.110
 and then cut and cut flush 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.940
 with him we have sharp 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.390
 we cut it flush then you go 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.620
 Let's see 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.620
 that I then slip 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.390
 it does not move but if I'm going to have to 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.230
 and print this force to strain it 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.170
 with the nail 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.129
 and whether it's the day in force this is what 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.129
 important of the sliding knot 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.110
 that people do not understand that the new 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.520
 has to be loose and run from a 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.150
 side for the other but you have to 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.820
 to be firm on the contrary what is not 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.280
 is made is with the material of the 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.910
 mother but it is done on the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.590
 mother material 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.780
 let's go back they want to see it back 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.000
 as I ask 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.000
 1 in parallel 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.580
 I loop if I do not start to pass a 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.310
 and 2 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:39.640
 and three 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:42.390
 and four and five and six now he pulled 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.390
 the two extremes 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.789
 and just 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:09.250
 and cut and I have new new paradise 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.280
 if something like that does not move it's not going to move 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.889
 this is the new correct how do you have to 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.910
 stay well firm 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.740
 do not 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.740
 and have mobility at least
