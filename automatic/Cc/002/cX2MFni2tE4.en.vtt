00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
being very defensively going to that

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.409 
being very defensively going to that
three<00:00:01.770> base<00:00:01.949> yeah<00:00:02.610> really<00:00:02.820> placed<00:00:03.090> at<00:00:03.210> both<00:00:03.330> of

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.370 
three base yeah really placed at both of
their<00:00:03.540> strength<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.959> think<00:00:04.049> gonna<00:00:04.259> have<00:00:04.350> a

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
their strength so I think gonna have a

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.320 
their strength so I think gonna have a
very<00:00:04.620> interesting<00:00:04.710> match<00:00:05.310> it's<00:00:05.910> like<00:00:06.060> what

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
very interesting match it's like what

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.089 
very interesting match it's like what
happens<00:00:06.779> when<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.049> kind<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.350> thing<00:00:07.589> goes

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
happens when this kind of thing goes

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.100 
happens when this kind of thing goes
down<00:00:08.130> I've<00:00:08.610> never<00:00:09.420> seen<00:00:09.599> these<00:00:09.719> players<00:00:09.960> play

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
before I almost feel like though

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.759 
before I almost feel like though
lifestyle<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.049> aggressive<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> reigns<00:00:13.650> in

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
so passive I feel like if there's a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.029 
so passive I feel like if there's a
style<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.599> good<00:00:15.809> against<00:00:16.080> life's<00:00:16.289> mmm

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
its reigns yeah I actually agree with

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.109 
its reigns yeah I actually agree with
that<00:00:19.199> completely<00:00:19.500> yeah<00:00:20.070> brains<00:00:20.789> gonna<00:00:20.970> have

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that completely yeah brains gonna have

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.420 
that completely yeah brains gonna have
to<00:00:21.210> find<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.539> chink<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> armor<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.560> maybe

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
to find a chink in the armor and maybe

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.950 
to find a chink in the armor and maybe
there<00:00:23.670> won't<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.449> mean<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.689> got<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.900> be

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
there won't be one I mean it's got to be

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
there won't be one I mean it's got to be
so<00:00:25.140> hard<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> find<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.430> he<00:00:26.519> does

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
so hard to find that when if he does

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.310 
so hard to find that when if he does
find<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.090> he<00:00:27.180> takes<00:00:27.480> full<00:00:27.660> advantage<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
find that he takes full advantage of it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
find that he takes full advantage of it
especially<00:00:28.550> with<00:00:29.550> speedlings<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.330> run

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
especially with speedlings and then run

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659 
especially with speedlings and then run
buys<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> whatnot<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.679> mean<00:00:32.369> if<00:00:32.489> there's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
buys and whatnot but I mean if there's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.580 
buys and whatnot but I mean if there's
one<00:00:32.820> player<00:00:33.120> that's<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.660> completely

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
one player that's going to be completely

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
one player that's going to be completely
fine<00:00:35.460> against<00:00:35.730> his<00:00:35.850> style<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> be

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
fine against his style it's going to be

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.319 
fine against his style it's going to be

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
circlings and results finished so has

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.410 
circlings and results finished so has
finished<00:02:52.920> cancel<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.790> natural<00:02:54.180> as<00:02:54.270> well

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
finished cancel that natural as well

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.120 
finished cancel that natural as well
yeah<00:02:54.870> there's<00:02:55.110> no<00:02:55.230> way<00:02:55.350> can<00:02:55.530> hold<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.770> natural

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
yeah there's no way can hold the natural

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.390 
yeah there's no way can hold the natural
but<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.610> still<00:02:57.300> holds<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.930> O's<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.250> mean

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
but I still holds the O's but I mean

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.090 
but I still holds the O's but I mean
speed<00:02:59.700> speed<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> way<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.080> as<00:03:01.260> well<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
speed speed is on the way now as well so

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.920 
speed speed is on the way now as well so
so<00:03:02.340> yeah<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.000> many<00:03:03.180> circlings<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.840> this

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
so yeah and so many circlings I get this

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.400 
so yeah and so many circlings I get this
aground<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.320> zealot<00:03:04.740> Oh<00:03:05.960> trust<00:03:06.960> life<00:03:07.230> to

try and surrounded in a problem like

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.140 
try and surrounded in a problem like
that<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:10.470> insane<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:11.760> keeping<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
aggression on it early adults coming out

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.640 
aggression on it early adults coming out
so<00:03:14.190> far<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.760> oh<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:16.230> holding<00:03:16.590> this

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
so far so you oh is holding this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.010 
so far so you oh is holding this
remarkably<00:03:17.190> well<00:03:17.460> yeah<00:03:17.910> i<00:03:18.330> saw<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.660> bills<00:03:18.900> and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
remarkably well yeah i saw the bills and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.780 
remarkably well yeah i saw the bills and
i<00:03:19.140> thought<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.500> sure<00:03:19.530> even<00:03:20.280> knowing<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.670> was

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
i thought for sure even knowing you was

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.920 
i thought for sure even knowing you was
gonna<00:03:20.850> have<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.120> gateway<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.450> his<00:03:21.570> main<00:03:21.720> even

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
gonna have the gateway in his main even

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.030 
gonna have the gateway in his main even
though<00:03:22.020> knowing<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.470> he<00:03:22.590> might<00:03:22.740> be<00:03:22.830> able<00:03:22.890> to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
though knowing that he might be able to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.590 
though knowing that he might be able to
stabilize<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.459> way<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.820> thought<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.209> sure<00:03:24.240> he

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
stabilize that way I thought for sure he

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.150 
stabilize that way I thought for sure he
was<00:03:24.630> dead<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.230> was<00:03:25.320> me<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.740> position<00:03:25.770> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
was dead if it was me in that position I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.980 
was dead if it was me in that position I
would<00:03:26.220> certainly<00:03:26.520> be<00:03:26.850> dead<00:03:27.030> yeah<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:27.840> um

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
would certainly be dead yeah but um

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.650 
would certainly be dead yeah but um
non-adjustable<00:03:28.620> same<00:03:29.310> time<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:30.240> constant

stream<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.870> links<00:03:31.170> was<00:03:31.260> built<00:03:31.470> up<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.800> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
stream of links was built up to the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.199 
stream of links was built up to the
point<00:03:32.070> where<00:03:32.250> they<00:03:32.400> can't<00:03:32.670> take<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:33.000> through

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.760 
point where they can't take on through
develops<00:03:33.600> yeah<00:03:33.930> maybe<00:03:34.290> getting<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.650> little

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
develops yeah maybe getting a little

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.170 
develops yeah maybe getting a little
over<00:03:35.040> ambitious<00:03:35.160> with<00:03:35.580> those<00:03:35.700> two<00:03:35.850> solids

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
over ambitious with those two solids

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.250 
over ambitious with those two solids
thinking<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.510> zergling<00:03:36.810> production<00:03:37.170> had

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
thinking that zergling production had

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.810 
thinking that zergling production had
stopped<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.680> life<00:03:37.860> can<00:03:38.100> see<00:03:38.250> people<00:03:38.580> more

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
stopped that life can see people more

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.310 
stopped that life can see people more
yeah<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.570> though<00:03:39.780> he<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.020> researching

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
yeah and though he is researching

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.990 
yeah and though he is researching
cycling<00:03:40.770> speed<00:03:41.010> he's<00:03:41.190> going<00:03:41.459> back<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> drum

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
cycling speed he's going back in a drum

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.640 
cycling speed he's going back in a drum
production<00:03:42.360> almost<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.810> only<00:03:42.840> wants<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> do

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
production almost the only wants to do

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.780 
production almost the only wants to do
some<00:03:43.860> light<00:03:43.980> pressure<00:03:44.160> with<00:03:44.370> us<00:03:44.459> maybe<00:03:44.610> he

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
some light pressure with us maybe he

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.280 
some light pressure with us maybe he
recognizes<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.630> can't<00:03:45.870> end<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.140> game

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
recognizes that you can't end the game

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.290 
recognizes that you can't end the game
yeah<00:03:46.709> which<00:03:47.010> what<00:03:47.550> he<00:03:47.640> can<00:03:47.820> do<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.030> deny<00:03:48.180> this

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
yeah which what he can do is deny this

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.970 
yeah which what he can do is deny this
natural<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:49.020> as<00:03:49.110> long<00:03:49.260> as<00:03:49.320> possible<00:03:49.470> with

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
natural for as long as possible with

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.440 
natural for as long as possible with
speedlings<00:03:50.370> which<00:03:50.580> i<00:03:50.730> actually<00:03:50.850> like<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> lot

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
speedlings which i actually like a lot

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.790 
speedlings which i actually like a lot
considering<00:03:51.810> he<00:03:52.170> got<00:03:52.320> rid<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.470> those<00:03:52.560> turns

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
considering he got rid of those turns

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.620 
considering he got rid of those turns
out<00:03:52.980> he's<00:03:53.550> in<00:03:53.790> such<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> comfortable<00:03:54.480> position

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
life finds away everywhere every time

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.080 
life finds away everywhere every time
and<00:04:33.160> he's<00:04:33.340> going<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.520> trade<00:04:33.729> with<00:04:33.820> probes

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
and he's going to trade with probes

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.249 
and he's going to trade with probes
again<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.710> all<00:04:35.710> losing<00:04:36.220> two<00:04:36.400> more<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:37.259> now

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
again and all losing two more and now

that<00:04:38.470> mothership<00:04:38.800> spoke<00:04:39.160> Millie<00:04:39.490> out<00:04:39.550> of<00:04:39.789> out

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
that mothership spoke Millie out of out

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.450 
that mothership spoke Millie out of out
of<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.900> picture<00:04:41.110> this<00:04:41.680> natural<00:04:42.130> is<00:04:42.190> wide<00:04:42.430> open

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
of the picture this natural is wide open

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.670 
of the picture this natural is wide open
it<00:04:43.090> looks<00:04:43.240> like<00:04:43.419> it's<00:04:44.020> like<00:04:44.139> life<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.530> just

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
it looks like it's like life is just

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.980 
it looks like it's like life is just
gonna<00:04:44.830> take<00:04:45.490> what<00:04:45.639> he<00:04:45.669> can<00:04:45.759> from<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.210> probe

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
gonna take what he can from the probe

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.360 
gonna take what he can from the probe
line<00:04:47.199> instead<00:04:47.530> yeah<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:47.889> think<00:04:48.039> it's<00:04:48.160> gonna<00:04:48.250> do

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
line instead yeah I think it's gonna do

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.740 
line instead yeah I think it's gonna do
as<00:04:48.460> much<00:04:48.610> damage<00:04:48.639> as<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.120> can<00:04:49.270> until<00:04:49.389> photon

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
as much damage as you can until photon

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.390 
as much damage as you can until photon
overcharge<00:04:50.110> happens<00:04:50.440> now<00:04:50.620> I'm<00:04:50.949> going<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
overcharge happens now I'm going to the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.270 
overcharge happens now I'm going to the
natural<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:51.940> cancel<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.389> but<00:04:53.130> there's<00:04:54.130> no

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
natural and cancel that but there's no

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.740 
natural and cancel that but there's no
way<00:04:54.310> this<00:04:54.580> was<00:04:54.729> getting<00:04:54.940> up<00:04:55.060> this<00:04:55.210> is<00:04:55.360> even

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
way this was getting up this is even

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.890 
way this was getting up this is even
worse<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.289> think<00:04:57.270> maybe<00:04:58.270> your<00:04:58.509> Ain<00:04:58.599> wasn't

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
worse I think maybe your Ain wasn't

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.300 
worse I think maybe your Ain wasn't
expecting<00:04:59.259> this<00:04:59.349> kind<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.770> follow<00:05:00.220> up

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
expecting this kind of a follow up

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.029 
expecting this kind of a follow up
because<00:05:00.490> sure<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.449> his<00:05:02.259> initial<00:05:02.680> defense<00:05:02.949> of

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
because sure the his initial defense of

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.850 
because sure the his initial defense of
the<00:05:03.130> temple<00:05:03.430> was<00:05:03.490> amazing<00:05:03.970> but<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:05.440> follow<00:05:05.650> up

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
the temple was amazing but to follow up

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.040 
the temple was amazing but to follow up
the<00:05:05.949> speedlings<00:05:06.449> yeah<00:05:07.449> there's<00:05:07.720> no<00:05:07.870> way

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
the speedlings yeah there's no way

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.870 
the speedlings yeah there's no way
there's<00:05:08.530> simply<00:05:08.770> no<00:05:08.979> way<00:05:09.009> and<00:05:09.310> he<00:05:09.400> cancels<00:05:09.789> out

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
there's simply no way and he cancels out

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.370 
there's simply no way and he cancels out
natural<00:05:10.240> blocking<00:05:10.690> off<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.840> main<00:05:11.169> with

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
natural blocking off the main with

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.680 
natural blocking off the main with
islands<00:05:11.949> as<00:05:12.039> well<00:05:12.070> yeah<00:05:12.849> it's<00:05:13.449> just

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
islands as well yeah it's just

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.360 
islands as well yeah it's just
everything<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.440> can<00:05:14.650> do<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.770> stay<00:05:15.009> alive<00:05:15.099> at

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
everything you can do to stay alive at

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.710 
everything you can do to stay alive at
this<00:05:15.430> point<00:05:15.699> I<00:05:15.970> actually<00:05:16.240> think<00:05:16.479> it<00:05:16.599> was<00:05:16.690> a

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
this point I actually think it was a

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.050 
this point I actually think it was a
mistake<00:05:16.810> for<00:05:17.289> life<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:18.190> commit<00:05:18.490> every<00:05:18.789> single

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
mistake for life to commit every single

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.730 
mistake for life to commit every single
zone<00:05:19.240> to<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:19.570> bottom<00:05:19.780> of<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.960> ramp<00:05:20.110> if<00:05:20.620> he

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
zone to the bottom of the ramp if he

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.080 
zone to the bottom of the ramp if he
maybe<00:05:20.979> had<00:05:21.160> one<00:05:21.340> up<00:05:21.460> there<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.789> kind<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.030> help

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
maybe had one up there to kind of help

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.580 
maybe had one up there to kind of help
block<00:05:22.419> the<00:05:22.449> pylons<00:05:22.960> yeah<00:05:23.169> that's<00:05:23.349> a<00:05:23.440> really

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
block the pylons yeah that's a really

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.260 
block the pylons yeah that's a really
good<00:05:23.770> point<00:05:23.949> yeah<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.550> look<00:05:24.880> how<00:05:24.940> many<00:05:25.150> more

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
good point yeah and look how many more

good point yeah and look how many more
so<00:05:25.479> because<00:05:25.630> making<00:05:26.099> obviously<00:05:27.099> one<00:05:27.490> pile<00:05:27.729> and

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
so because making obviously one pile and

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.460 
so because making obviously one pile and
had<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.120> be<00:05:28.210> kind<00:05:28.780> of<00:05:28.840> cancelled<00:05:29.199> there<00:05:29.320> so

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
had to be kind of cancelled there so

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.040 
had to be kind of cancelled there so
they<00:05:29.560> could<00:05:29.710> go<00:05:29.830> down<00:05:30.010> the<00:05:30.130> ramp<00:05:30.250> once<00:05:30.550> again

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
they could go down the ramp once again

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.980 
they could go down the ramp once again
but<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.099> horrible<00:05:33.099> position<00:05:33.460> there<00:05:33.909> yeah<00:05:34.570> for

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
but a horrible position there yeah for

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.899 
but a horrible position there yeah for
rain<00:05:35.169> three<00:05:35.560> gateways<00:05:35.860> now<00:05:36.039> working<00:05:36.610> sent<00:05:36.820> to

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
rain three gateways now working sent to

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.580 
rain three gateways now working sent to
finish<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.360> grain<00:05:37.690> is<00:05:37.780> gonna<00:05:37.960> century<00:05:38.289> expand

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
finish and grain is gonna century expand

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.960 
finish and grain is gonna century expand
from<00:05:38.710> here<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:40.139> it<00:05:41.139> looks<00:05:41.530> really<00:05:41.620> bad<00:05:42.039> but<00:05:42.310> he

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
from here and it looks really bad but he

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.640 
from here and it looks really bad but he
might<00:05:43.150> he<00:05:43.510> stole<00:05:43.690> some<00:05:43.930> comeback<00:05:44.229> potential

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
might he stole some comeback potential

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.320 
might he stole some comeback potential
he<00:05:44.740> has<00:05:44.830> like<00:05:44.919> 500<00:05:45.099> minerals<00:05:45.610> bank<00:05:45.820> yeah

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
he has like 500 minerals bank yeah

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.600 
he has like 500 minerals bank yeah
expand<00:05:46.840> again<00:05:47.050> he's<00:05:47.530> still<00:05:47.860> even<00:05:48.250> on<00:05:48.340> workers

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
expand again he's still even on workers

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.790 
expand again he's still even on workers
even<00:05:48.909> but<00:05:49.210> it's<00:05:49.900> just<00:05:50.050> life<00:05:50.259> is<00:05:50.289> so<00:05:50.530> much<00:05:50.620> map

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
even but it's just life is so much map

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.620 
even but it's just life is so much map
control<00:05:51.190> yes<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:51.699> much<00:05:51.820> map<00:05:51.970> control<00:05:52.389> and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
control yes so much map control and

it<00:06:33.000> sinful<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:33.720> I<00:06:33.870> think<00:06:34.100> it<00:06:35.100> rain<00:06:35.850> knew<00:06:36.150> that

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
it sinful and I think it rain knew that

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.570 
it sinful and I think it rain knew that
that<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.110> the<00:06:37.140> spawning<00:06:37.920> pool<00:06:38.100> gone<00:06:38.280> down<00:06:38.460> and

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
that the the spawning pool gone down and

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.670 
that the the spawning pool gone down and
was<00:06:38.670> researching<00:06:39.030> speed<00:06:39.450> I<00:06:40.020> think<00:06:40.440> you<00:06:40.560> would

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
was researching speed I think you would

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.350 
was researching speed I think you would
have<00:06:40.830> played<00:06:41.040> it<00:06:41.130> a<00:06:41.160> lot<00:06:41.280> safer<00:06:41.670> what<00:06:42.270> is

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
have played it a lot safer what is

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.520 
have played it a lot safer what is
taking<00:06:42.570> this<00:06:42.630> natural<00:06:42.990> maybe<00:06:43.140> a<00:06:43.230> minute<00:06:43.440> or

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
taking this natural maybe a minute or

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.630 
taking this natural maybe a minute or
two<00:06:43.710> later<00:06:43.860> behind<00:06:44.130> maybe<00:06:44.310> some<00:06:44.550> more

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
two later behind maybe some more

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.520 
two later behind maybe some more
gateways<00:06:44.850> yeah<00:06:45.330> embedded<00:06:45.810> in<00:06:45.930> okay<00:06:46.140> position

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
gateways yeah embedded in okay position

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.970 
gateways yeah embedded in okay position
because<00:06:46.740> his<00:06:46.920> initial<00:06:47.220> defense<00:06:47.550> was
