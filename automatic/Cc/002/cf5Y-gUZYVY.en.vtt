which<00:01:54.090> leads<00:01:54.360> us<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.079> will

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
which leads us to think that they will

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
which leads us to think that they will
not<00:01:55.500> officially<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> part<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> MCU

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
not officially be a part of the MCU

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.330 
not officially be a part of the MCU
which<00:01:57.600> could<00:01:58.200> make<00:01:58.350> things<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:58.979> tricky

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
which could make things a little tricky

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.039 
which could make things a little tricky
so<00:02:00.000> who<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.270> think<00:02:00.540> would<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.810> best

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so who do you think would be the best

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.020 
so who do you think would be the best
choice<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.649> play<00:02:01.920> spider-man<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.850> the

choice to play spider-man and are the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520 
choice to play spider-man and are the
spin-off<00:02:03.390> films<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> good<00:02:03.930> idea<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.409> they

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
spin-off films a good idea if they
