00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
things that vary in I think you want

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.889 
things that vary in I think you want
your<00:01:41.549> quarterback<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.060> play<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.780> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
your quarterback to play well and I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.330 
your quarterback to play well and I
think<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.259> had<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.560> younger<00:01:43.860> guys<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.220> on

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
think we had some younger guys in on

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
think we had some younger guys in on
defense<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.229> maybe<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.470> sure<00:01:46.649> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
defense and so maybe that's sure to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.679 
defense and so maybe that's sure to
happened<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.340> think<00:01:48.000> they<00:01:48.090> did<00:01:48.270> good<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.570> know
