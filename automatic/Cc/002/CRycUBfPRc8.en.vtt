boobies now I'm going to go in with
mulch<00:01:49.700> which<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:51.049> clip<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:54.079> I'm<00:01:55.039> going

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
mulch which is this clip and I'm going

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.899 
mulch which is this clip and I'm going
to<00:01:55.399> put<00:01:55.549> this<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.909> so<00:02:00.340> I'm<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.459> to<00:02:01.520> use<00:02:01.670> my

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
to put this on so I'm going to use my

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.160 
to put this on so I'm going to use my
translucent

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
translucent

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.350 
translucent
I'm<00:02:03.890> going<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.099> use<00:02:04.189> my<00:02:04.340> translucent<00:02:05.119> powder

I'm going to use my translucent powder
so<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.659> first<00:02:05.840> step<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.560> quantify<00:02:11.200> these

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
so the first step is to quantify these

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.539 
so the first step is to quantify these
almost<00:02:12.500> too<00:02:12.620> big<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.860> fit<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.040> my<00:02:13.130> left<00:02:13.370> now
