00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.500
 The heavy duty STS 1060 II telescopic handler is launched with a range of technical and ergonomic optimizations. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.300
 For the operator, this results in more safety, reliability and flexibility. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 A major innovation is the construction of the spacious driver's cab with 360 ° all-round visibility. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 The controls are also in the direct field of view of the user with their main functions, 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.300
 such as the joystick for controlling the telescopic arm functions as well as the side shift and the dynamic load control information display. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 After manual selection of the attachment via the selector switch, the calculator supplies all relevant information, 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.800
 such as raised weight, extension length and tilt angle of the telescopic arm as well as the stability index on the 8.5 inch color display. 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 This creates a high degree of safety for the operator. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.600
 The sideshifting and leveling functions, used individually or together, offer both flexible and safe applications. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.800
 While the superstructure with telescopic arm can be moved hydraulically to the left or to the right when moving sideways 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.700
 and thus avoiding frequent displacement of the machine during handling operations, 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 The level compensation straightens lateral floor inclinations and gives the STS 1060 II the required stability during use. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 Equipped with three different steering modes, 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.300
 The heavy duty telehandler can be individually adapted to the project requirements. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.800
 In addition to the front-wheel and all-wheel steering, the diagonal steering, 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.300
 in which all 4 wheels steer in one direction, for practical selection. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.500
 Thus, the lateral displacement of the machine is possible. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.800
 A technical innovation that, in addition to protecting the floor, also saves time in the respective operating conditions. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.600
 Further technical details of the STS 1060 II in maximum values ​​are: 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:32.800
 The carrying capacity of 6,000 kg, the lifting height of 9.55 m and the range of 5.50 m. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.400
 Permanent four-wheel drive and 100 hp under the hood 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.200
 give the Telelader the required traction and maneuverability. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.400
 The heavy duty telehandler STS 1060 II from the Beyer rental park is versatile. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.000
 Crane hook, load hook, winch or shovel make the forklift a multifunctional rental device.
