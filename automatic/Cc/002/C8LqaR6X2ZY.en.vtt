00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 heli knox table when is one 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.150
 lightweight among the camping tables 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.840
 got caught a whopping 680 grams 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.400
 the dimensions are 60 x 40 x 40 centimeters so 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.880
 everything very clearly arranged 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 here we see him in the whole 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 you have to build your glory 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.939
 just down underneath macho or racing or 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.240
 imagine grass 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 that's the wrap up over there 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.540
 is the many noks camping chuan and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.120
 below is the table jan helin ochs 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.570
 a little longer the bag a bit longer 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.000
 the packaging is not much bulkier though 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.480
 for motorcyclists for example here 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.600
 bmw enduro case there you have to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.280
 something superior and maybe even 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 put the table diagonally in it 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.899
 unpacked sees the table again 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.140
 very clear typical heli knox 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.100
 out there is the polyester cover and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.530
 there are aluminum bars like the bars 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 This is usually done with heli knox 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.790
 whole in a minute is ratzfatz and 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.909
 the 680 grams are actually one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.350
 to lift your finger up 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.250
 without problems and the whole works very much 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.290
 stable 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.570
 that too is typical heli knox I have 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.270
 try a little pressure on the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.100
 first exercise with the surface 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 palms to see if the whole 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.689
 it is still stable if he even has one 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.759
 dish or anything else can do 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.030
 the very nice impression you see now 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.409
 here are the first drinks cartridges 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.780
 as it should be alcoholic on the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.210
 shooting and of course the camping 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 Literature we always in the backpack 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.740
 I have been recommending it since 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.689
 Years always with many books 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.299
 lug around but you see here 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.700
 the table holding the problems from there 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.810
 nothing bends that's right 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.399
 stable 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.060
 then you can if you want the e 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.619
 to present linux chair chair one and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.540
 have a good time 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:19.230
 at a price of 9 95 euro for the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.930
 table when to it is also good 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.739
 let's go but I think it's worth it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.739
 on the go
