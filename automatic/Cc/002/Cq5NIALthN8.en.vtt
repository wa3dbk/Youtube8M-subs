dead I wanted to talk to you about what
do<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:56.100> chilling<00:01:56.520> effect<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:57.000> be

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
do you think the chilling effect will be

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.600 
do you think the chilling effect will be
once<00:01:57.689> bringing<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.380> drone<00:01:58.710> warfare<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.520> at

home now corporations schools can have

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.440 
home now corporations schools can have
drones<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.729> mean<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.030> seems<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.360> there's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
drones I mean it just seems like there's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.499 
drones I mean it just seems like there's
going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.750> an<00:02:03.869> endless<00:02:04.079> supply<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:05.509> people

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
going to be an endless supply of people

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.940 
going to be an endless supply of people
using<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.110> drones<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.829> think

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
using these drones what do you think

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.900 
using these drones what do you think
that's<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.819> American

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that's going to do to the American

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.950

right<00:03:44.290> there's<00:03:45.290> well<00:03:45.830> there's<00:03:45.860> two<00:03:46.370> x<00:03:46.670> just<00:03:47.000> to

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
right there's well there's two x just to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.270 
right there's well there's two x just to
be<00:03:47.420> fair<00:03:47.600> there's<00:03:47.840> two<00:03:48.050> things<00:03:48.290> first<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.100> all

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
be fair there's two things first of all

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.550 
be fair there's two things first of all
there's<00:03:49.820> normalization<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.720> acceptance

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560

policies<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.710> interesting<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.340> it's

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
policies it is interesting that it's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.480 
policies it is interesting that it's
kind<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.180> two<00:04:29.510> two<00:04:30.410> areas<00:04:30.980> of<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.130> spectrum

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
kind of two two areas of the spectrum

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.090 
kind of two two areas of the spectrum
one<00:04:31.790> is<00:04:31.970> you<00:04:32.570> know<00:04:32.690> I'm<00:04:33.020> fighting<00:04:33.620> war<00:04:33.860> the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
one is you know I'm fighting war the

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.010 
one is you know I'm fighting war the
smarter<00:04:34.550> way<00:04:34.730> there's<00:04:35.360> really<00:04:35.660> no

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
smarter way there's really no

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.230 
smarter way there's really no
alternative<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.730> know<00:04:37.850> you're

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
alternative it's just you know you're

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.940 
alternative it's just you know you're
fighting<00:04:38.630> war<00:04:38.780> with<00:04:38.930> drones<00:04:39.200> so<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:39.680> more

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
fighting war with drones so it's more

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.420 
fighting war with drones so it's more
precise<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:42.140> better<00:04:42.470> way<00:04:42.710> to<00:04:42.770> fight<00:04:43.100> war<00:04:43.400> I

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
precise and a better way to fight war I

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.370 
precise and a better way to fight war I
guess<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:44.030> could<00:04:44.180> say<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:44.600> wanted<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.170> get<00:04:45.260> your
