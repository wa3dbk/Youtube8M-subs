00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello everyone here in the preserve of more 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.980
 strong that the puntocom good iron 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.590
 Many people say I go to the gym but 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.210
 I do not want to put myself as he maintains that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.509
 I do not want to get too big just 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.910
 toned and that's why I use 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.369
 many repetitions with light weights 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.160
 well for that to tone to mark 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.949
 the muscle how you get the real 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.619
 good muscle tone if we flex the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.619
 biceps although we have a little bit 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.380
 and we press 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.790
 and we see that the muscle is marked in 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.830
 muscles heritage 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.590
 without needing to have it in position 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.450
 flexed I do not have it that way extended and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.990
 tense and the thing changes 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.200
 two are marked so if we could walk 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.020
 for life 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.870
 totally pensioned that would give us 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.420
 pretty much muscle in fact there's 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.720
 people who walk a little like that not with the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.400
 separate basses to be noticed 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.610
 muscle that they do not really have 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.830
 but of course this solution is not effective 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.370
 to get the muscle tone that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.380
 we want because it will lead us to not 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.530
 Let's run out of air not so much thinking 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.290
 how do we get it then well then 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.930
 we can train for the muscle 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.780
 when we are relaxed, keep 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.360
 for as semi-flexed as being and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.730
 tensed and this is what the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.960
 true everything in a muscle in a 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.479
 residual tension when the muscle is 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.690
 relaxed an increased muscle tone is 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.300
 produces when the nervous system is 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 more alert when the muscles are 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.520
 semi in tension 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.060
 even while we are relaxed in 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.460
 definitive when the muscles are there 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.610
 as ready for the activity this is 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.350
 also known as my gene lathe and 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.870
 good as we have seen in other videos 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.340
 muscle strength is made 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.410
 of tension and that same tension is that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.110
 same tension training that 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.020
 that tone will give us that biogenic tone 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.350
 muscle so if you gain strength 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.520
 learning to generate 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.890
 tension the more force you generate the more 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.560
 hard you're going to be because the muscles 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.290
 to remain semi stressed or 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.990
 flex that way the training 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.680
 of strength and training to win 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.990
 all muscle is practically being 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.870
 the same if you really want to tone up 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.970
 you have to do just the opposite of 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.080
 what is normally said you have to 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.560
 train weigh down backhand a lot of weight 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.490
 for example the glutes that muscle that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.960
 So much do girls want to have hard 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.630
 it's hardly going to get hard doing 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.810
 many repetitions of exercises 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.150
 aerobic but we're going to need 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.300
 put a lot of weight the gluteus is a 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.200
 very strong muscle and the best way to 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.070
 activate it 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.440
 is to train heavy those heavy dead 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.470
 heavy squats 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.110
 heavy training the glutes will generate 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.810
 in them a great tension that is what 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.250
 will reduce that tone of hardness that 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.740
 We are looking for 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.480
 another example are sad tickets 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.900
 it's a muscle that a lot of people want 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.990
 harden or you want to define and good 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.240
 the triceps 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.569
 they are muscles that like their own name 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.350
 Indica has three heads 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:50.580
 to see if he does not give them for this one 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:54.120
 I was in the middle middle head and you're 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.670
 ok most of the time the head of the 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.940
 triceps that does all the work is the 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.190
 middle head 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.010
 to work on the other two 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.160
 heads the ones on the sides has to 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.890
 produce a very big tension and that 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.080
 it translates into using a weight 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.960
 quite large so that for 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.269
 get everything in the sad likewise 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.420
 we have to cause great tension 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.790
 use a good big weight and first of all 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.310
 this may arise the question then 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.920
 because bodybuilders are much more 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.900
 relaxed that the poor limits that 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.680
 they train with much bigger weights 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.039
 much heavier 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.190
 the type of the power live but devious 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.830
 fat and heavy edge but very strong is 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.900
 because we look at the more categories 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.500
 high those that have no weight limit 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.560
 if we go to categories where there are 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.410
 weight limit we will see much more bodies 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.560
 defined much more marked and with a 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.210
 appearance much harder power lift 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.940
 is that they are in the highest category 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.190
 they have a layer of fat on them 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.590
 muscles that are really hard that 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.199
 layer of fat as it also helps them 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.229
 lift the weight because it stabilizes them 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.960
 when sometimes you are easier to move 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.509
 a resistance that is outside of you a 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.740
 external resistance but those of the 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.630
 categories with weight limit if there is a 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.930
 weight limit for example the category 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.349
 of 80 kilos the uncle can not afford 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.440
 have fat but what you want is 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.420
 that those 80 kilos are pure muscle and 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.510
 hence the definition 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.400
 muscle of these athletes so if of 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.190
 you really want to tone up really 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.980
 you want to get all muscular trains 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.770
 heavy you're not going to put on like a dying 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.250
 for training like that because that depends on 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.770
 little of the food that you get into, you do not go 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.050
 to build lots of muscle if 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.780
 you do not eat much, nobody goes to 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.580
 frank to 10 overnight 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.940
 it's not that you make your flight and 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.720
 heavy training 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.930
 x 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.610
 all the fishing you go to sleep and to the day 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:14.940
 next you wake up with a lot 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.770
 the muscle is seen coming then if you see 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.780
 that are putting you too wide 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.730
 that's not what you want to behave 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.670
 a little bit in the food or a little bit 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.100
 also in training that problem 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.500
 believe me you will not have to put 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.930
 it's too big without realizing it by 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.120
 course if the goal is the opposite 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.580
 If I want to gain muscle mass and get 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.240
 as big as possible so what I have 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.080
 is to train heavy and catch a lot of good 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.690
 that's all 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.250
 I would like your comments about 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.290
 if you have had any experience 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.810
 with this that you have gotten all 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.630
 muscular training heavy or if not 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.330
 you have managed to train lightly 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.660
 I like to subscribe if you liked the 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.830
 video a greeting 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.830
 and to continue strong
