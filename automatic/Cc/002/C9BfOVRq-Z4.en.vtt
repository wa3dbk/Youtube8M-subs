a<00:02:54.140> fine<00:02:54.709> girl<00:02:54.920> because<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.580> labeling<00:02:56.000> and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
a fine girl because of that labeling and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.120 
a fine girl because of that labeling and
I<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:56.570> no<00:02:56.810> idea<00:02:57.080> why<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.290> think<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.770> labeling

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
I have no idea why I think the labeling

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.580 
I have no idea why I think the labeling
is<00:02:58.340> like<00:02:58.640> awesome<00:02:58.910> but<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:02.000> my<00:03:02.150> son<00:03:02.630> missed

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.300 

I<00:03:13.800> am<00:03:14.800> that<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.250> pretty<00:03:16.000> good<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.830> it's

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
I am that is pretty good that it it's

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.920 
I am that is pretty good that it it's
quite<00:03:18.520> refreshing<00:03:18.700> it's<00:03:19.330> not<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.570> best<00:03:19.810> idea

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
quite refreshing it's not the best idea

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.410 
quite refreshing it's not the best idea
I've<00:03:20.290> ever<00:03:20.410> had<00:03:20.710> that<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.580> is<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.750> good<00:03:22.900> IPA<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
I've ever had that it is a good IPA it

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.560 
I've ever had that it is a good IPA it
this<00:03:26.110> one<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:27.160> less<00:03:27.520> fresh<00:03:27.880> though<00:03:28.180> as<00:03:28.510> it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
this one is less fresh though as it

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.970 
this one is less fresh though as it
could<00:03:28.990> be<00:03:29.020> i<00:03:29.230> think<00:03:29.620> i'm<00:03:29.800> not<00:03:29.980> sure<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:31.120> expires

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
could be i think i'm not sure it expires

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.150 
could be i think i'm not sure it expires
the<00:03:32.980> first<00:03:33.220> december<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:35.500> not<00:03:35.950> exactly

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
the first december so it's not exactly

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.140

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
most IPAs and it's super refreshing

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.240 
most IPAs and it's super refreshing

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
which is nice sometimes a very dry IPA

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.650 
which is nice sometimes a very dry IPA
isn't<00:03:45.550> that<00:03:45.640> refreshing<00:03:45.820> because<00:03:46.270> it<00:03:46.480> just

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
isn't that refreshing because it just

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.180 
isn't that refreshing because it just
