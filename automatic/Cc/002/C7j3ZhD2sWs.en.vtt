have no idea what it is well to be

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.560 
have no idea what it is well to be
honest<00:05:10.260> I'm<00:05:10.950> not<00:05:11.010> too<00:05:11.400> sure<00:05:11.820> obviously<00:05:12.450> an

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
honest I'm not too sure obviously an

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.950 
honest I'm not too sure obviously an
anime<00:05:12.900> but<00:05:13.110> an<00:05:13.560> anime<00:05:14.010> that's<00:05:14.970> kind<00:05:15.570> of<00:05:15.660> dark

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
anime but an anime that's kind of dark

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.269 
anime but an anime that's kind of dark
and<00:05:16.200> very<00:05:16.530> twisted

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.889 

I<00:05:22.309> thought<00:05:22.969> the<00:05:23.119> scene<00:05:23.299> started<00:05:23.599> out<00:05:23.689> really

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:23.899 
I thought the scene started out really

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.819 
I thought the scene started out really
strong<00:05:24.129> actually<00:05:25.129> because<00:05:25.749> glad<00:05:26.749> that<00:05:26.959> green

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:27.829 
strong actually because glad that green

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:29.979 
strong actually because glad that green
haired<00:05:28.129> girl<00:05:28.339> was<00:05:28.639> kind<00:05:29.149> of<00:05:29.209> attractive<00:05:29.749> and

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:29.989 
haired girl was kind of attractive and

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:32.859 
haired girl was kind of attractive and
then<00:05:30.199> just<00:05:30.459> it<00:05:31.459> started<00:05:31.909> going<00:05:32.299> downhill<00:05:32.539> from

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:32.869 
then just it started going downhill from

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.769 
then just it started going downhill from
there<00:05:33.079> I<00:05:34.179> thought<00:05:35.179> it<00:05:35.239> was<00:05:35.449> gonna<00:05:35.569> be<00:05:35.749> a

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
there I thought it was gonna be a

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:40.329 
there I thought it was gonna be a
typical<00:05:36.199> like<00:05:37.599> gory<00:05:38.599> anime<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:39.499> thought<00:05:40.249> was

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:40.339 
typical like gory anime I thought was

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.069 
typical like gory anime I thought was
gonna<00:05:40.459> go<00:05:40.579> over<00:05:40.609> the<00:05:40.879> edge<00:05:40.999> with<00:05:41.209> like<00:05:41.419> guts

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:42.079 
gonna go over the edge with like guts

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:45.699 
gonna go over the edge with like guts
and<00:05:42.289> stuff<00:05:42.529> like<00:05:42.739> that<00:05:42.949> and<00:05:43.279> um<00:05:43.959> honestly<00:05:44.959> it

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:45.709 
and stuff like that and um honestly it

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:47.319 
and stuff like that and um honestly it
wasn't<00:05:45.979> as<00:05:46.219> bad<00:05:46.399> as<00:05:46.459> I<00:05:46.729> thought<00:05:46.759> it<00:05:46.999> would<00:05:47.179> be

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:47.329 
wasn't as bad as I thought it would be

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:49.629 
wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
because<00:05:47.929> after<00:05:48.559> getting<00:05:48.979> stabbed<00:05:49.309> a<00:05:49.459> few

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
because after getting stabbed a few

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.289 
because after getting stabbed a few
times

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:50.299 
times

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:53.559 
times
they're<00:05:50.959> like<00:05:51.199> slight<00:05:51.769> likes<00:05:52.729> taboos<00:05:53.239> and

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
they're like slight likes taboos and

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:54.969 
they're like slight likes taboos and
throwing<00:05:53.959> a<00:05:54.079> lot<00:05:54.229> of<00:05:54.259> boy

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
throwing a lot of boy

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.719 
throwing a lot of boy
at<00:05:55.849> some<00:05:56.059> point<00:05:56.469> ollar<00:05:57.469> ate<00:05:57.709> it<00:05:57.889> I<00:05:58.009> mean<00:05:58.159> this

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
at some point ollar ate it I mean this

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.350 
at some point ollar ate it I mean this
does<00:05:59.149> I<00:05:59.179> thought<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.569> would<00:05:59.659> be<00:06:01.329> overall<00:06:02.329> I

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
does I thought it would be overall I

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.869 
does I thought it would be overall I
think<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:02.869> scene<00:06:04.569> definitely<00:06:05.569> fake<00:06:06.099> okay<00:06:07.099> but

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879 
think the scene definitely fake okay but

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.739 
think the scene definitely fake okay but
I<00:06:07.909> mean<00:06:08.119> I<00:06:08.469> guess<00:06:09.469> I<00:06:10.239> think<00:06:11.239> I<00:06:11.360> thought<00:06:11.539> it<00:06:11.659> was

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:11.749 
I mean I guess I think I thought it was

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:13.059 
I mean I guess I think I thought it was
a<00:06:11.779> good<00:06:11.929> scene<00:06:12.139> because<00:06:12.379> I'm<00:06:12.499> a<00:06:12.529> big<00:06:12.739> fan<00:06:13.039> of

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
a good scene because I'm a big fan of

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.359 
a good scene because I'm a big fan of
four<00:06:13.489> and<00:06:13.879> a<00:06:14.029> boar<00:06:14.449> but<00:06:15.169> I<00:06:15.199> mean<00:06:15.379> as<00:06:15.499> far<00:06:15.679> as<00:06:15.739> the

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:16.369 
four and a boar but I mean as far as the

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:17.619 
four and a boar but I mean as far as the
reason<00:06:16.610> why<00:06:16.729> I'm<00:06:16.819> saying<00:06:17.029> it's<00:06:17.269> fake<00:06:17.449> is

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629 
reason why I'm saying it's fake is

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.049 
reason why I'm saying it's fake is
because<00:06:17.869> she<00:06:18.079> got<00:06:18.229> stabbed<00:06:18.529> a<00:06:18.860> lot<00:06:19.699> of<00:06:19.879> times

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:20.059 
because she got stabbed a lot of times

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:21.339 
because she got stabbed a lot of times
and<00:06:20.269> there<00:06:20.329> was<00:06:20.449> a<00:06:20.479> lot<00:06:20.779> of<00:06:20.809> blood<00:06:21.109> like<00:06:21.289> a

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
and there was a lot of blood like a

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.519 
and there was a lot of blood like a
tsunami<00:06:21.769> of<00:06:21.949> blood<00:06:22.279> and<00:06:23.049> when<00:06:24.049> you<00:06:24.139> changes

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 
tsunami of blood and when you changes

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.589 
tsunami of blood and when you changes
the<00:06:24.649> scene<00:06:24.889> the<00:06:25.669> stabber

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
the scene the stabber

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.449 
the scene the stabber
has<00:06:26.869> no<00:06:27.289> blood<00:06:27.499> on<00:06:27.649> her<00:06:27.799> whatsoever<00:06:27.979> there's

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:28.459 
has no blood on her whatsoever there's

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:31.449 
has no blood on her whatsoever there's
no<00:06:28.579> blood<00:06:28.819> on<00:06:28.849> the<00:06:29.029> floor<00:06:29.299> like<00:06:30.229> that<00:06:30.439> I<00:06:30.709> guess

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:31.459 
no blood on the floor like that I guess

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:34.600 
no blood on the floor like that I guess
in<00:06:31.639> terms<00:06:31.819> of<00:06:32.499> anime<00:06:33.499> realism<00:06:34.099> it<00:06:34.309> looks

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
in terms of anime realism it looks

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.070 
in terms of anime realism it looks
pretty<00:06:34.849> fake<00:06:35.149> but<00:06:36.079> yeah

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.260 

I<00:06:41.110> was<00:06:41.830> thinking<00:06:42.550> about<00:06:42.699> watching<00:06:42.910> this

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
I was thinking about watching this

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.189 
I was thinking about watching this
because<00:06:44.080> you<00:06:44.470> know<00:06:44.699> the<00:06:45.810> green<00:06:46.810> homegirl<00:06:47.080> look

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 
because you know the green homegirl look

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.540 
because you know the green homegirl look
really<00:06:47.379> attractive<00:06:47.440> but<00:06:47.949> after<00:06:48.220> seeing<00:06:48.400> a

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
really attractive but after seeing a

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.180 
really attractive but after seeing a
seven-year-old<00:06:49.060> get<00:06:49.270> brutally<00:06:49.659> murdered

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
seven-year-old get brutally murdered

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.550 
seven-year-old get brutally murdered
like<00:06:51.190> that<00:06:51.400> I<00:06:51.900> don't<00:06:52.900> think<00:06:53.050> I'd<00:06:53.139> probably<00:06:53.319> I

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
like that I don't think I'd probably I

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.869 
like that I don't think I'd probably I
don't<00:06:53.710> think<00:06:53.830> I'd<00:06:53.889> watch<00:06:54.069> this<00:06:54.280> no<00:06:54.550> that's

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 
don't think I'd watch this no that's

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.749 
don't think I'd watch this no that's
just<00:06:54.940> I<00:06:55.319> don't<00:06:56.319> like<00:06:56.440> seeing<00:06:56.770> children

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759

just I don't like seeing children
getting<00:06:57.909> stabbed<00:06:58.210> I<00:06:58.710> feel<00:06:59.710> like<00:06:59.830> this<00:06:59.949> is<00:07:00.009> a

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
getting stabbed I feel like this is a

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.790 
getting stabbed I feel like this is a
very<00:07:00.129> mellow<00:07:00.810> example<00:07:01.810> what's<00:07:02.169> in<00:07:02.349> the<00:07:02.500> anime

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
very mellow example what's in the anime

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.550 
very mellow example what's in the anime
