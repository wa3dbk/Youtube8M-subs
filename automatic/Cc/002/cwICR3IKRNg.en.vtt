apples<00:03:42.190> obviously<00:03:43.190> that's<00:03:43.370> their<00:03:43.549> main<00:03:43.730> crop

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
apples obviously that's their main crop

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.270 
apples obviously that's their main crop
here<00:03:44.299> at<00:03:44.480> rabe<00:03:44.720> farms<00:03:45.109> so<00:03:45.650> we<00:03:45.799> really<00:03:46.069> want<00:03:46.250> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
here at rabe farms so we really want to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.280 
here at rabe farms so we really want to
be<00:03:46.400> able<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.609> next<00:03:46.940> fall<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:47.900> fall<00:03:48.139> was

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
be able to next fall and this fall was

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.170 
be able to next fall and this fall was
tough<00:03:48.530> because<00:03:48.709> of<00:03:48.889> our<00:03:49.069> short<00:03:49.220> time<00:03:49.459> frame

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
tough because of our short time frame

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.629 
tough because of our short time frame
and<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.930> growing<00:03:51.260> season<00:03:51.680> challenges<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.489> had

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
and the growing season challenges we had

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.030 
and the growing season challenges we had
with<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:52.880> with<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.209> spring<00:03:53.599> that<00:03:54.560> next<00:03:54.859> fall

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
with this with a spring that next fall

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.319 
with this with a spring that next fall
we<00:03:55.160> can<00:03:55.190> develop<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.549> partnership<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.209> we

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
we can develop that partnership so we

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.420 
we can develop that partnership so we
can<00:03:56.599> get<00:03:56.780> apples<00:03:57.200> from<00:03:57.530> rabe<00:03:57.769> farms<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.280> bring

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
can get apples from rabe farms and bring

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.680 
can get apples from rabe farms and bring
them<00:03:58.519> right<00:03:58.730> directly<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.329> dining<00:03:59.660> hall
