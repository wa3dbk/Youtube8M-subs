00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.419 
you get to is probably actually better
to<00:01:41.840> go<00:01:42.049> from<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.499> other<00:01:42.619> side<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.069> land<00:01:43.249> in

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
to go from the other side and land in

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.260 
to go from the other side and land in
and<00:01:43.999> just<00:01:44.149> kind<00:01:44.329> of<00:01:44.359> end<00:01:45.289> up<00:01:45.920> down<00:01:46.219> here<00:01:46.270> before

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
and just kind of end up down here before

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.730 
and just kind of end up down here before
you<00:01:47.359> stop<00:01:47.569> your<00:01:47.689> airplane<00:01:48.049> that's<00:01:48.499> probably

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
you stop your airplane that's probably

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.580 
you stop your airplane that's probably
easiest<00:01:49.159> way<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.399> do<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.639> but<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.479> bailed<00:01:51.079> out<00:01:51.350> I

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
easiest way to do it but I bailed out I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.709 
easiest way to do it but I bailed out I
figured<00:01:52.219> why<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.429> hell<00:01:52.700> not<00:01:52.729> probably<00:01:53.630> could

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
figured why the hell not probably could

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.910 
figured why the hell not probably could
about<00:01:53.899> our<00:01:54.109> little<00:01:54.259> sooner<00:01:54.530> before<00:01:54.709> we

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
about our little sooner before we

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.069 
about our little sooner before we
bounced<00:01:55.219> up<00:01:55.340> in<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.520> air<00:01:55.780> but<00:01:56.780> here<00:01:56.959> we<00:01:57.049> go

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
bounced up in the air but here we go

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.989 
bounced up in the air but here we go
we've<00:01:57.469> got<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.619> helicopter<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.700> was<00:01:58.819> pretty

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
one we're going to where we can store

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.560 
one we're going to where we can store
helicopters<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.500> airplanes<00:03:48.739> that<00:03:49.160> we<00:03:49.310> still

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
helicopters and airplanes that we still

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.620 
helicopters and airplanes that we still
so<00:03:50.570> that's<00:03:51.320> pretty<00:03:51.560> cool<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:53.120> now<00:03:53.299> we<00:03:53.360> have<00:03:53.480> a

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
so that's pretty cool and now we have a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.560 
so that's pretty cool and now we have a
chin<00:03:53.930> hook<00:03:54.549> we<00:03:55.549> can<00:03:55.760> actually<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.329> think<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
chin hook we can actually I think the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.210 
chin hook we can actually I think the
names<00:03:56.780> pop<00:03:57.049> up<00:03:57.170> when<00:03:57.350> we<00:03:57.410> steal<00:03:57.650> stuff<00:03:57.860> doesn't

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
names pop up when we steal stuff doesn't

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.460 
names pop up when we steal stuff doesn't
it<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.840> don't<00:03:59.840> know<00:03:59.900> I<00:03:59.930> didn't<00:04:00.230> see<00:04:00.320> your<00:04:00.440> name

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
pop up this one oh this this is probably

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.699 
pop up this one oh this this is probably
the<00:04:03.590> longest<00:04:03.739> part<00:04:04.130> just<00:04:04.430> flying<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.880> they're

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
the longest part just flying it they're

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.430 
the longest part just flying it they're
stealing<00:04:06.709> it<00:04:06.829> is<00:04:06.980> easy<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.519> quick<00:04:08.320> getting<00:04:09.320> it

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
stealing it is easy and quick getting it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.440 
stealing it is easy and quick getting it
there<00:04:09.650> if<00:04:10.220> i<00:04:10.370> knew<00:04:10.519> whoever<00:04:10.730> will<00:04:11.120> going

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
there if i knew whoever will going

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.770 
there if i knew whoever will going
before<00:04:12.489> like<00:04:13.489> we<00:04:13.970> left<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.299> base<00:04:14.450> i<00:04:14.660> could

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
before like we left the base i could

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.140 
before like we left the base i could
have<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:15.019> like<00:04:15.250> put<00:04:16.250> down<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.579> dot<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:16.789> just

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
have just like put down the dot and just

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.330 
have just like put down the dot and just
blown<00:04:17.450> hear<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:18.560> helicopter<00:04:19.130> would<00:04:19.250> have

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
blown hear the helicopter would have

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.190 
blown hear the helicopter would have
been<00:04:19.430> lost<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:20.359> we<00:04:20.510> would<00:04:20.630> had<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.780> more<00:04:21.019> direct

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
been lost and we would had a more direct

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.890 
been lost and we would had a more direct
flat<00:04:21.560> here<00:04:21.769> we<00:04:21.890> probably<00:04:22.070> got<00:04:22.370> here<00:04:22.520> quicker

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
flat here we probably got here quicker

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.040 
flat here we probably got here quicker
well<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:23.960> feel<00:04:24.289> we're<00:04:24.530> well<00:04:24.890> within<00:04:24.919> time

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
well I feel we're well within time
