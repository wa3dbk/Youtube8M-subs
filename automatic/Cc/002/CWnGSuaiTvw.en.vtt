00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
out of all carbon fiber the reason why i

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.910 
out of all carbon fiber the reason why i
like<00:00:56.180> about<00:00:56.450> CPM<00:00:56.899> film<00:00:57.140> tools<00:00:57.320> is<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.680> most

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
out of carbon fiber and as you can see

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.059 
out of carbon fiber and as you can see
it's<00:01:02.300> all<00:01:02.450> black<00:01:02.750> because<00:01:03.350> it's<00:01:03.500> all<00:01:03.680> carbon

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:04.069 
it's all black because it's all carbon

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.429 
it's all black because it's all carbon
fiber<00:01:04.100> being<00:01:04.879> carbon<00:01:05.329> fiber<00:01:05.689> it<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.109> very<00:01:06.380> very

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
fiber being carbon fiber it is very very

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.469 
fiber being carbon fiber it is very very
lightweight<00:01:06.829> and<00:01:07.189> that's<00:01:07.609> one<00:01:07.909> benefit<00:01:08.420> of

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
lightweight and that's one benefit of

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.660 
lightweight and that's one benefit of
having<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:09.170> lightweight<00:01:09.560> cage<00:01:09.889> you<00:01:10.369> don't<00:01:10.549> want

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
having a lightweight cage you don't want

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.059

you carry the camera really really

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.429 
you carry the camera really really
heavily<00:01:16.279> the<00:01:16.909> one<00:01:17.090> reason<00:01:17.389> DSLRs<00:01:17.899> are<00:01:17.990> popular

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
heavily the one reason DSLRs are popular

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
is because of its lightweight size but

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:22.870 
is because of its lightweight size but
if<00:01:21.229> you'll<00:01:21.350> be<00:01:21.529> able<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.889> have<00:01:22.039> cages<00:01:22.369> which<00:01:22.700> is

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
recommend when buying this cage is a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.170 
recommend when buying this cage is a

quick-release right away on top of the
cage<00:03:17.099> but<00:03:17.699> the<00:03:17.849> bad<00:03:18.030> thing<00:03:18.209> about<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.510> is

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
cage but the bad thing about that is

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.539 
cage but the bad thing about that is
that<00:03:18.870> you'll<00:03:19.260> be<00:03:19.500> able<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.859> enough<00:03:20.190> space

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
to tighten down these screws and getting

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.039 
to tighten down these screws and getting
out<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> camera<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.629> tighten<00:03:24.900> down<00:03:24.930> the

said it's quite working well and another

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.479 
said it's quite working well and another
bad<00:04:06.030> thing<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.479> that<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.989> base<00:04:07.409> plate<00:04:07.650> or<00:04:07.979> you

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
bad thing is that the base plate or you

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.640 
bad thing is that the base plate or you
can<00:04:08.669> call<00:04:08.819> this<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.209> cheese<00:04:09.599> plate<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.379> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
can call this a cheese plate that the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.589 
can call this a cheese plate that the
camera<00:04:10.979> mounted<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:12.060> don't<00:04:12.239> have<00:04:12.389> any

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.630 
build this up into a big bulldog rig
which<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.680> tried<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.800> out<00:05:10.860> before<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.340> post<00:05:11.550> it

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
which I tried it out before and post it

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.420 
which I tried it out before and post it
on<00:05:11.790> vimeo<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:13.170> basically<00:05:13.500> this<00:05:13.770> really<00:05:14.100> helps

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
on vimeo so basically this really helps

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.670 
on vimeo so basically this really helps
to<00:05:14.490> build<00:05:14.730> up<00:05:15.000> or<00:05:15.180> lessen<00:05:15.960> down<00:05:16.140> just<00:05:16.560> like

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
to build up or lessen down just like

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.530 
to build up or lessen down just like
this<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:17.100> now<00:05:17.490> i'll<00:05:17.670> be<00:05:17.790> demonstrating<00:05:17.940> how

film<00:05:30.540> tools<00:05:30.750> cube<00:05:31.260> cage<00:05:31.820> basically<00:05:32.820> what<00:05:32.910> i

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
film tools cube cage basically what i

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.180 
film tools cube cage basically what i
have<00:05:33.240> here<00:05:33.480> i<00:05:33.660> started<00:05:34.200> out<00:05:34.350> with<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.710> basic

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
have here i started out with a basic

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.610 
have here i started out with a basic
cube<00:05:35.460> cage<00:05:35.670> here<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.120> i<00:05:36.540> adapted<00:05:37.230> a<00:05:37.290> quick

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
cube cage here and i adapted a quick

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.870 
cube cage here and i adapted a quick
release<00:05:37.800> system<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.370> that<00:05:38.400> i<00:05:38.490> can<00:05:38.610> quickly

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
release system so that i can quickly

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.910 
release system so that i can quickly
release<00:05:39.390> the<00:05:39.540> camera<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.260> off<00:05:40.410> and<00:05:40.680> i

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
so that i can have some handles to carry

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.570 
so that i can have some handles to carry
this<00:05:45.450> cube<00:05:45.930> cage<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:46.410> i<00:05:47.040> also<00:05:47.190> have<00:05:47.400> another

convenient<00:05:52.140> about<00:05:52.380> this<00:05:52.710> cage<00:05:53.310> is<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.700> it

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
convenient about this cage is that it

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.050 
convenient about this cage is that it
does<00:05:54.390> have<00:05:54.420> lots<00:05:54.990> of<00:05:55.220> holes<00:05:56.220> here<00:05:56.550> where<00:05:56.970> you

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
could adapt a quarter mount holes so i

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.910 
could adapt a quarter mount holes so i
bought<00:05:59.970> some<00:06:00.000> Jupiter<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.840> inserts<00:06:01.230> and<00:06:01.440> it

and<00:06:21.390> since<00:06:22.380> you<00:06:22.560> can<00:06:22.710> still<00:06:22.950> adapt<00:06:23.310> a<00:06:23.490> rod

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
and since you can still adapt a rod

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.570 
and since you can still adapt a rod
system<00:06:24.240> here<00:06:24.480> I<00:06:24.660> had<00:06:25.140> that<00:06:25.320> I<00:06:25.500> adapted<00:06:25.950> a<00:06:26.220> 12

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580
