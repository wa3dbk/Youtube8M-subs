00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.090
 the secular chambers have passed to the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.490
 history of photography were the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.789
 first small format cameras in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.670
 use 35 mm film what 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.340
 that was a technical milestone 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.220
 mass produced from 1924 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.230
 they became a great commercial success 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.090

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.570
 brand 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.420
 this is German industry first 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.730
 quality the design is very elegant and I think 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.339
 it can be overcome by it either 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.440
 they were modified they are perfect also the 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.329
 trigger sound is something that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.339
 happens often when working with 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.710
 a layman that some photographer is given 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.710
 turn and recognize that sound right away 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.839
 the cameras are manufactured locally 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.960
 solange Germany near Frankfurt in 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.220
 2005 the company was about to go to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 bankruptcy 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.500
 Andrea is Kaufman took over the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.230
 company is 59 years old and is a photographer 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.890
 passionate fascinated by the history of 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.890
 these cameras 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.950
 in what contributed to the myth was that the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.900
 cameras appeared in a moment of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 interest in the reproduction of the world 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.390
 for the images in the newspapers and 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 magazines for the reports timlin 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.600
 they made acquaintances very fast through 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.420
 of the photographers who used them in the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.750
 most famous reporter photos used 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.080
 a lay among them the French henri 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.860
 Cartier Bresson and the German Franc 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.050
 gisela joint images like these gave 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.409
 around the world and they became the 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.869
 symbol of a whole era the laywoman passed 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.090
 to be an object of worship not only for 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.520
 professional photographers 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.890
 mijael jungblut continues photographing with 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.170
 a laywoman, although she does not use it in the studio 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.950
 but for his more documentary works 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.799
 and narrative leaves us a lot does not 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.170
 you need a bag to carry it one passes 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.670
 unnoticed and the best thing is that you do not 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.920
 take seriously 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.569
 I do not want to be recognized right away with 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.910
 a professional photographer 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.200
 many people get scared then they refuse and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.300
 they ask me what I want 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.739
 photograph it if they end up adopting a 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.739
 pose and clear is not what I want 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.319
 like to a work tool 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.750
 for photographers and design objects 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:48.330
 there are models like this titanium 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.330
 or a special edition of hermès 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.319
 in the secular cabal he always had a 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.459
 special design a new design like the 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.319
 by paul smith adapts very well the 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.480
 Hermes was based on the style of a 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.000
 well-known car designer 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.030
 baltar de silvas this is also a 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.230
 shows that lay women in a certain way 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.570
 represents the best of design 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.030
 industrial German hard and the decade that 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.480
 more times all in the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.160
 traditional but also a secular 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.320
 it can be an investment 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.870
 the so-called proto laica is not property 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.540
 de andres with font the first models 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.430
 collectibles are coveted in 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.560
 May of last year they were paid more than 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.340
 Two million cálculo by a laywoman 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.880
 year 1923 the largest sum ever paid for 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.880
 a camera 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.909
 of the call series 0 there are only 21 or 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.549
 perhaps 23 chambers of the finished secular 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.689
 gold with viper skin there are only about 80 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.060
 units 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.939
 a part was lost among those objects 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.380
 unrepeatable that represent a part 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:05.890
 of the history of photography shifter 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.440
 in 2009 with the digital model m 9 and the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.090
 of medium format s 2 the company returned to 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.940
 Position yourself in the professional market 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.880
 Since then they have increased the 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.480
 sales 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.010
 the laywoman that is the most recent model and 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.470
 the most expensive 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.650
 only the body costs twenty thousand 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.650
 euros 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.400
 The advantage of lay is that it has the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.770
 best lenses that exist and that still 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.960
 can make them I think that only 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.490
 they launched the model because they thought that 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.979
 they needed a body for those 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.660
 objectives the camera itself seems to me that 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.000
 it's good 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.130
 a book has just been published with 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.950
 occasion of the anniversary of these cameras 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.770
 of worship a trip through the history of the 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.770
 photography that owes so much to lay
