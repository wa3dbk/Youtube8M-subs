00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.140 
there's a huge number of different
skills<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:53.950> bits<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.460> equipment<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:55.030> we<00:04:55.120> use

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
skills and bits of equipment that we use

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.610 
skills and bits of equipment that we use
to<00:04:55.599> construct<00:04:55.780> it

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620
