 Welcome to the training camp 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.489
 Follow the Green Act 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.980
 and collectors a first vague 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.730
 You see, and that's where Box is a small brown dot on your map 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.600
 is 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 According to Wacker Chemie with the firepower bayonet is effective only in close combat 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.010
 Allofs follow the yellow act to the firing range and collectors the box 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 Plextor sorrow 4 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.930
 it will return to the menu button though the rifle gives the shotgun a shot 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.370
 a straight line 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.370
 Witten 7 that the look through the visor 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.670
 103 para 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 when the two goals off and it goes on 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.120
 from the committee 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 Oberhausens it carries sadness 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.420

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.200
 Idealists waiting for the Heidelberger at a hundred meters distance 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.900
 though he does the sniper rifle this weapon works like the normal one 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.520
 guarantee 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.770
 only is thus automatically on 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.460
 around 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.610
 and a swine flu disease zone 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 the longer you own, the more insecure a shot will be 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 Putz both goals Red but I was scared 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.750
 and by contributing 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.110
 not bad 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.200
 I think you are fit for the more exclusive episode of the red day 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.760
 Grenades and collectors got new equipment 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.290
 but a tail succumbed to none 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.659
 Accelerate more buzz than what we had so far in the oven so beware 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.669
 With the celebration button you create the throwing distance like you do on the bottom of the page 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.700
 Read off the ad 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.170
 if you're free again, the grenade explodes 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.330
 think of it more energy equal more distance 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.699
 unfortunately use 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:39.869
 Red 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.869
 who am I? 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.759
 Blue is wearing sadness 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.759
 I think quartered was in the test 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.790
 now wanted the ball and hit the victory 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.980
 It shows the one track pm runtime Mar 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.369
 Brocade expands it in sight as you follow the goals with the angles 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:25.969
 Keys pads 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.519
 and neatly puts power in the ground 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.170
 she jumps like a stone across the water hits the targets on the other side 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.540
 above and does not fall into the water so has Â«Are not you yet 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.659
 Here is the ideas 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.499
 Here is the duel of last year 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.869
 after a good and reasonable 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.899
 and now some sport 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.899
 Follow the Violet ride and climb over the gate 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.949
 that gets tricky so listen 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.629
 where do I have to go over this ruined bridge 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.130
 in the run-up and squeezing the flushing button get any medicine PS Brady 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.499
 Dougan 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:17.400
 behind us 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.180
 only who you need 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.310
 the in this 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.090
 Mine field who taps in there rarely take a piece again 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.240
 you'll notice the red areas on his patio 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.879
 you have a load right now 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.560
 MT MT collected 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.560
 Beware that is currently dangerous Klopp 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.180
 we will blow up the history of this house 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.719
 who wants to see this and this suddenly the league 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.829
 Now look if you hurt something useful in there 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.020
 We have this deposited and I have something to furniture 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.490
 at the shelter on the other side that Milan for that you get new 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.490
 Instructions but be careful 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.490
 I told you to be careful 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.000
 Will you ever be like that? 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.300
 Tell me about a minefield is not a lawn 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.849
 the project is a shelter if there is an inside pig dog 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.849
 this now and thirsty action day STA to come in 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.569
 Vehicles are also used with the action shock you get out again 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.479
 When you're done, you'll get your last game at the end of the third quarter 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:53.700
 shows Heidelberg 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.340
 The exercise meeting with the Bazooka the last two goal 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.029
 since it even works like a grenade blur it closes much further afield 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.029
 still 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.240
 but cook 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.919
 Brouwers following the death of two soldiers
