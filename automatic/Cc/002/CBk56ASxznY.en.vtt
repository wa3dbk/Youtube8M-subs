a regular litter box with one on end at
the<00:00:41.190> back<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.840> devised<00:00:43.590> something<00:00:44.070> similar

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the back so I devised something similar

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.069 
the back so I devised something similar
to<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.539> plastic<00:00:45.899> placemat<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
to that it's just a plastic placemat and

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
to that it's just a plastic placemat and
I<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.620> plastic<00:00:50.129> clips<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.579> they<00:00:50.700> don't

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I get these plastic clips so they don't

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.590 
I get these plastic clips so they don't
rust<00:00:51.120> case<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.989> wet<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.210> they<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.420> use

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
rust case they get wet and they will use

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.410 
rust case they get wet and they will use
that<00:00:55.370> nugget<00:00:57.170> kalahari<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:59.449> Sequoia<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.989> my

plastic<00:01:25.200> originally<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.100> didn't<00:01:26.460> buy<00:01:26.820> these

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
plastic originally I didn't buy these

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.859 
plastic originally I didn't buy these
eggs<00:01:28.820> because<00:01:30.049> their<00:01:31.070> space<00:01:32.070> intensive<00:01:32.670> there

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
eggs because their space intensive there

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.130 
eggs because their space intensive there
24<00:01:33.869> almost<00:01:34.170> 2<00:01:34.409> feet<00:01:34.439> wide<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
24 almost 2 feet wide and I don't have a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.700 
24 almost 2 feet wide and I don't have a
lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> space<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.970> cat<00:01:39.210> beds<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.990> since

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
lot of space for just cat beds but since

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.289 
lot of space for just cat beds but since
I'm<00:01:40.860> putting<00:01:41.250> those<00:01:41.490> litter<00:01:41.790> boxes<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.270> here

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I'm putting those litter boxes up here

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
I'm putting those litter boxes up here
anyway<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.750> thought<00:01:43.079> I'd<00:01:43.259> try<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.530> eggs<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.189> you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
anyway I thought I'd try the eggs as you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
anyway I thought I'd try the eggs as you
can<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:46.049> hit<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.380> bad

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
can see this one got hit really bad

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:57.220 
can see this one got hit really bad
today<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> suspect<00:01:51.439> kalahari<00:01:52.439> for

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.720 

and<00:01:58.230> stretching<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.830> down<00:01:58.980> with<00:01:59.160> my<00:01:59.340> vinegar

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
and stretching it down with my vinegar

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:13.340 
and stretching it down with my vinegar
and<00:01:59.880> water<00:02:00.060> solution<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:11.900> think<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.960> eggs<00:02:13.200> are

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and water solution I think the eggs are

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.410 
and water solution I think the eggs are
kind<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.590> cool<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> perfect<00:02:14.460> little<00:02:14.730> what

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
kind of cool what a perfect little what

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.880 
kind of cool what a perfect little what
a<00:02:15.450> perfect<00:02:15.870> solution<00:02:16.020> if<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:16.650> use<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:18.890> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
a perfect solution if they use it it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
a perfect solution if they use it it
comes<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.400> pad<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.090> put<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.420> bottom

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
