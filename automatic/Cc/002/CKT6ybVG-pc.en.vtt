00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.150
 everybody is good 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.689
 I'm here preaching tutorial with 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.180
 antonia missiles a little different is 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.820
 can also be used with both appliques 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.439
 tic-tac as normal hair but I think 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.710
 that has to be the longest hair 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.720
 because otherwise a hairstyle can not 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.489
 stand firm and I think it can be used 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.030
 in several champions depending on the shape 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.160
 that you use for example an accessory 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.400
 transfer is on a day to day basis at work 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.559
 I 've never seen anyone wearing this on the street. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.870
 The only time I was stretched was bigger. 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.280
 the boy wearing and she had her hair 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.970
 Smooth and beautiful 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.430
 in case I have curly hair 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.049
 because I have curls lately but the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.790
 customer can choose both with bunches 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:05.040
 as iso will depend on the occasion 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.540
 season you 'll make a ponytail 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.710
 to be able to do this hairstyle 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.360

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.090
 things you get with your ass 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:37.429
 horse right here too 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.429
 the power that way 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.460
 to put the hand like that and pull 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.800

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.310

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.479
 I'll show more closely to whoever 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.020

 curls to stay a little longer 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.440
 closed and I'm going to put the accessory 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.440
 example 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.220
 so it's cool to put some accessory 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.890
 different you can use what you 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.540

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.849
 then you realized that some parts 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.620
 my hair is very loose is 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.349
 because they are very short what is this 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.650
