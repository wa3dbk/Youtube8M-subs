00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.700
 Hello, how are you and the cartoonist? 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.560
 to make our dove or our 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.940
 Dove in flight let's do the 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.850
 next we are going to take a paper 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.390
 square and we're going to take this corner to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390
 this corner 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.080
 so the paper that folded as if 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 out a triangle a pyramid and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.290
 we mark here with the fingers with the nails 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.870
 well well marked 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:40.090
 we unfold times that I am staying here we are going to 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.090
 find this corner from here up down 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.180
 It is very very good 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.370
 we change and we mark and we do not take the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.760
 paper and if it was like a cross 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 so it must stay now let's go back to 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.520
 our original position and we're going to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.880
 bring this here if it is here you can see the 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.390
 line that we made from the other doubles 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:11.570
 and we are going to do this we are going to find this 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.570
 this one itches with this edge he cited 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.950
 we mark the strong double 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.250
 very well 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.079
 very well we unfold and we do again 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.079
 this on the other side 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.020
 and we mark well with the nails with the 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.810
 dry verse 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.659
 we doubled them up like this and we go back to 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.880
 do this here towards this abortion and now 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.829
 we have the girl very well what are we going to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.840
 do is now take the paper and for this 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.060
 line if you see it this corner 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.060
 let's talk the paper back 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.960
 and we should have something like that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.360
 this way we should be staying 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.950
 Now what we are going to do is that if it is 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.650
 that here is like a pocket 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 we are going to open this pocket like that and what 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.870
 we are going to open 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.870
 and we are going to mark here 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.540
 perfect had like this form here and a 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.489
 tip looks like the tip of an arrow but 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.459
 well we want to do a pigeon in 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.440
 an arrow and now let's catch this is 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.980
 a cow and we are going to upload it 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.980
 A) Yes 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.850
 very well and on the other side we turn the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.340
 paper and love this corner down here 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.340
 we are going to climb out the other 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.060
 very well 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.800
 perfect now we have almost our 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.320
 Dove what we need is to make a 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.960
 Then we will pick up here 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.550
 puntita and let's look 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.319
 talk a little inwards 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.790
 A) Yes 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.790
 the idea is to take out a small 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.720
 now good but then the pigeon does not 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.310
 they can have the wings up like this 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.310
 that we're going to do a double is like that 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.890
 and a doubles here well a little market and for 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.890
 the other side if you want too 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.180
 and so now that our is crazy 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.940
