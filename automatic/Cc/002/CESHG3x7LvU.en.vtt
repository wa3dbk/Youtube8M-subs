hypnotizing song the vocals come in

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.260 
hypnotizing song the vocals come in
about<00:04:07.110> two<00:04:07.320> minutes<00:04:07.470> thirty<00:04:07.830> seconds<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
about two minutes thirty seconds in and

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.140 
about two minutes thirty seconds in and
but<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.840> 4-minute<00:04:10.380> mark<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.769> this<00:04:10.890> one<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:12.030> has

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
but the 4-minute mark on this one it has

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.759 
but the 4-minute mark on this one it has
one<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.480> my<00:04:12.510> favorite<00:04:12.900> riffs<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.410> full<00:04:13.620> of

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
one of my favorite riffs of the full of

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.759 
one of my favorite riffs of the full of
the<00:04:13.920> album<00:04:14.340> kicks<00:04:15.209> in<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.169> song<00:04:16.410> kind<00:04:16.620> of

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
the album kicks in and the song kind of

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.310 
the album kicks in and the song kind of
speeds<00:04:17.100> up<00:04:17.250> at<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.519> point<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.660> bass<00:04:18.930> really

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
speeds up at that point the bass really

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.199 
speeds up at that point the bass really
moves<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.769> along<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.310> there's<00:04:20.790> some<00:04:21.000> just

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
moves it along and there's some just

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.790 
moves it along and there's some just
excellent<00:04:21.780> soloing<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.350> think<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> best

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
excellent soloing I think the best

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.720 
excellent soloing I think the best
soloing<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.460> album<00:04:23.789> is<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.210> song

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
soloing of the album is on this song

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.890 
soloing of the album is on this song
overtop<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.780> real<00:04:25.960> cool<00:04:26.260> riff<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:27.730> I<00:04:28.450> love

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
overtop of the real cool riff and I love

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.920 
overtop of the real cool riff and I love
how<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.110> CD<00:04:29.590> ends<00:04:29.860> off<00:04:30.060> definitely<00:04:31.060> has<00:04:31.600> the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
how the CD ends off definitely has the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.720 
how the CD ends off definitely has the
my<00:04:32.140> favorite<00:04:32.470> moment<00:04:32.830> moments<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.460> whole

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
my favorite moment moments in this whole

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.430 
my favorite moment moments in this whole
album<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.690> think<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:34.990> last<00:04:35.230> song

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
album and I think this last song

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.310 
album and I think this last song
basically<00:04:35.950> sums<00:04:36.310> up<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:37.180> album<00:04:37.390> and<00:04:37.780> it's

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
basically sums up the album and it's

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.590 
basically sums up the album and it's
about<00:04:38.500> seven<00:04:38.890> minutes<00:04:39.040> long<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.730> I'll<00:04:40.420> tell
