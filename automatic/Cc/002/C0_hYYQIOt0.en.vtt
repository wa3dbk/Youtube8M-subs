00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.850
 hello girls here I am with us 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 experiment I did with resin 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.699
 I bought a retina that I found at 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.699
 brico therefore not the e 30 or the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 crystal resin which are those that 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 until now I used to state that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.330
 I do not carry out a resin word from 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.250
 a long time so I saw it 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 brigo and I bought it I did the first 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.079
 experiments these are the first 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.060
 experiments as you can see are 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.070
 quite acceptable inside 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.070
 only added some glitter so I have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.530
 made a whole mess in everything 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.710
 once I put resin and glitter on them 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 I simply put it to catalyze 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.330
 so this is the result here 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.460
 I'll show you the packaging this is 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.080
 the resin I'm talking about and the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.070
 saratoga and I took this 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.600
 confession that costs 9 euros and 90 and they are 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 500 grams 500 milliliters wrong here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 there are instructions to know how it goes 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.520
 mixed because there is also the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.760
 catalyst that would be this small 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.030
 small bottle then and here explains that it goes 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.210
 practically united from 1 to 3 percent 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.040
 of catalyst to the resin 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.750
 I did the 3 percent right for 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.940
 be sure that in short they are 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 catalyzed my cabos are for whom 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.460
 as you see this here and a resin that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.430
 need to repair then I did not know 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 if it was actually good I asked 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.440
 if they sold a resin for which to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.150
 yes inclusion to include 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.530
 objects I said no we do not sell 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.500
 bubble I take it and try if it doesn't 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 go well my father's gift a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.780
 someone in the end as you see is gone 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.620
 quite well the positive thing is that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.460
 actually 500 million 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.070
 there are so many baked cabochons 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.310
 to infinity and costs 9 euros and 90 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.870
 this is the part of the resin and this 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.870
 exactly as I showed him is the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.230
 so you have a catalyst 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.900
 bilancina I use that little one there 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.510
 that I bought from the Chinese that makes me 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.450
 also the grammy and the two compounds 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.730
 then eventually if you need help there 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.950
 next time we do it together though 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.780
 it's really very simple this is the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.030
 result therefore as a positive thing 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.570
 we said that it is definitely the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.910
 price as a bad thing is that it stinks from 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.270
 die I decided to do this 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.180
 experiment at ten in the evening with home 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.830
 all closed with radiators e 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.600
 I was practically dying said now 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.460
 leave a message on facebook that 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.830
 tomorrow I won't be there anymore I 'll be dead for 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.570
 because of some offshore clubs because 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.240
 smells beyond belief 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.190
 and in fact the second experiment I have it 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.110
 made their own girls outdoors 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.330
 because it stinks from an accident 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.180
 after saying even 300 thousand times 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.760
 it really stinks so much so use it 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.980
 eventually masks always used 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.290
 your protections when you use the resin 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.160
 because really if it goes to touch a little 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.410
 leather made 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.570
 I believe you are frigate to mel per 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.760
 luck never happened another thing 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.430
 negative though let's say I wanted to 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.780
 try is not so bad e 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.050
 that the coloring is slightly 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.630
 amber 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.120
 now I don't know if you realize from the video 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.750
 that is, the part of resin also you see 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.120
 where there are no glitter is not 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.090
 perfectly transparent so if 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.280
 you actually have to play on the color 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.140
 and do something really 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.510
 transparent put the little flower 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.540
 to include something not included 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.150
 you can do is slightly amber 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.739
 really not even noticeable 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.900
 others who were there because there were 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.959
 of the others that were resin 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.939
 polyester and cost much much more 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.099
 they were yellowish there was really written 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.200
 on the jar there is also this 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.140
 written that something else is amber 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.350
 negative is that they bring us a little more 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.509
 to dry while with the other resin 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.039
 even the problem really 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.880
 I think it is so fast that I can do without 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.280
 ten hours 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.810
 this one or it took us a couple of 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.039
 abundant days 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.620
 I checked after a whole night and 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.780
 I went to drop a cabochon era 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.789
 still all so sticky that I have 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.340
 thought he had the wrong dose 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.800
 actually even if you put one for 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.320
 2 percent over them 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.169
 therefore they catalyze them and the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.419
 cabochons will actually come 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.150
 hardened the difference lies in the time of 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.190
 therefore laying with 3 percent to say 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.440
 you hold it for a couple of days 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.259
 with one percent I had to go up 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.479
 a little more than days and even once 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.560
 that you drop them from your mold 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.610
 released another day a 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.560
 rest so that they become 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.510
 actually shiny now I'm not 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.270
 more sticky and are 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.770
 quietly workable otherwise 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.260
 you always have that feeling of 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.120
 sticky positive thing he says 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.120
 also on the box that can be 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.830
 anyway you can paint them if you 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.389
 you have done something wrong is managed 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.460
 crap like seconds I made 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.979
 which I will show you now I am to dry 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.409
 you can safely to repaint the 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.659
 upstairs so you can make nail art 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.940
 to say about the cubs I will then show 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:39.000
 or you can create any kind of 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.370
 you can really other drawing 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.030
 cover them and then it will look like one 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.460
 something kind of button 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.520
 so obviously this is different 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.230
 what i think i think i re 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.570
 I will use several times above all 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.400
 when I don't need it I repeat the resin 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.520
 transparent when I don't need it 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.190
 actually the water effect when 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.920
 I want to bake cabochons at full blast 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.750
 because now I really have a lot 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.840
 need opacity I have to take advantage of it 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.430
 I became drugged so when I got 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.950
 need to churn out many ocean clubs 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.380
 I think I'll definitely pick it up again if 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.510
 instead I actually need the 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.570
 particular thing I need 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.400
 of the water effect then of the 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.390
 absolute transparent I will use the 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.430
 temperature 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.860
 the e 30 is a resin that I don't like 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.420
 because after a while it turns yellow and 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.160
 so I found myself with taboos 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.620
 they are yellow, maybe you were wrong 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.740
 but something may be that we try again 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.240
 for the moment I will use this hope 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.040
 so that the idea and there may be 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.200
 help see you next time 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.480
 of course all sorry I forgot 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.260
 to tell you something this one I have it 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.210
 found at the briko precisely in leroy 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.120
 merlin so you can do it around the 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.040
 found there were other kits e 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.770
 precisely to the briko to my briko 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.780
 with not only in the resin the 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.420
 catalyst but also the fiber of 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.520
 glass and therefore cost much more 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.140
 there was the small tray and the small brush e 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.360
 this fiberglass if you want 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.830
 actually do this kind of 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.900
 repairs 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.630
 so obviously you don't need it if 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.360
 you can find this which is the basis 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.790
 then from 9 euros and 90 because otherwise 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.800
 the other will cost you around 17 euros e 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.720
 so as if we had done nothing 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.500
 on the internet I've seen that for some 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.500
 part sell it and I'll see some links 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.040
 maybe on ebay and eventually there 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.300
 put in the information box then dates 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.140
 possibly a peek into the box 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.240
 information 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:42.820
 having said that I really believe I have 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.820
 all kissed bye next time
