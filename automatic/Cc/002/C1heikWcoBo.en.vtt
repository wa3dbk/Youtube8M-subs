00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
about the case so you want to forget

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.890 
about the case so you want to forget
about<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.310> scoop<00:02:52.700> all<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.390> want<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.570> do<00:02:53.720> is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
about that scoop all you want to do is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.980 
about that scoop all you want to do is
slightly<00:02:54.140> push<00:02:54.770> down<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.970> tail<00:02:56.150> slightly

slightly push down on the tail slightly

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.050 
slightly push down on the tail slightly
and<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:58.220> want<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.430> push<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.580> down<00:02:58.730> in<00:02:58.910> this

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
and you want to push it down in this

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.850 
and you want to push it down in this
pocket<00:02:59.330> right<00:02:59.690> here<00:02:59.720> cuz<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.620> pocket

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
pocket right here cuz in that pocket

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.040 
pocket right here cuz in that pocket
it's<00:03:01.130> gonna<00:03:01.250> simulate<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.030> scoop<00:03:02.360> because<00:03:02.810> if

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
it's gonna simulate the scoop because if

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.420 
it's gonna simulate the scoop because if
you<00:03:03.140> put<00:03:03.350> pressure<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.920> pocket<00:03:04.100> it's

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
you put pressure in that pocket it's

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.370 
you put pressure in that pocket it's
gonna<00:03:04.580> make<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:04.970> rotation<00:03:05.600> in<00:03:05.750> front<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.260> you

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
gonna make that rotation in front of you

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.890 
gonna make that rotation in front of you
so<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.490> simulate<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.270> scooping<00:03:08.750> motion

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
so it's to simulate the scooping motion

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.840 
so it's to simulate the scooping motion
if<00:03:09.320> you're<00:03:09.590> trying<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.920> do<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.160> on<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.610> cruiser

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
if you're trying to do it on the cruiser

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.960 
if you're trying to do it on the cruiser
like<00:03:11.440> how<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.680> supposed<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.070> be<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.340> normal

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
like how it's supposed to be on a normal

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.910 
like how it's supposed to be on a normal
skateboard<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:17.200> forget<00:03:18.200> about<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.530> forget

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
skateboard so forget about it forget

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.250 
skateboard so forget about it forget
about<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.610> school<00:03:19.940> forget<00:03:20.510> about<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:21.050> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
about that school forget about it the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.480 
about that school forget about it the
back<00:03:21.470> foot<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.770> important<00:03:22.220> because<00:03:22.310> that's

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
back foot is important because that's

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.370 
back foot is important because that's
how<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.700> get<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.970> cruiser<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.420> rotate<00:03:23.810> since

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
how you get the cruiser to rotate since

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.420 
how you get the cruiser to rotate since
the<00:03:24.470> cruiser<00:03:24.710> is<00:03:24.920> lighter<00:03:25.160> than<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the cruiser is lighter than the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.830 
the cruiser is lighter than the
skateboarder<00:03:25.940> doing<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.300> scooping<00:03:26.720> motion

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
skateboarder doing the scooping motion

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.020 
skateboarder doing the scooping motion
is<00:03:27.290> most<00:03:27.920> likely<00:03:28.130> going<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.460> put<00:03:28.820> too<00:03:29.000> much

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
is most likely going to put too much

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.020 
is most likely going to put too much
power<00:03:29.480> on<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.110> tail<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:31.670> gonna<00:03:31.790> just

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
power on the tail and it's gonna just

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.690 
power on the tail and it's gonna just
cause<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.600> over<00:03:32.840> flip<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:33.680> simply<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.400> just

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
cause it to over flip so simply you just

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.370 
cause it to over flip so simply you just
want<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.970> do<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.330> push<00:03:35.720> down<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.140> pocket

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
want to do is push down in that pocket

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.170 
want to do is push down in that pocket
and<00:03:36.620> give<00:03:36.800> it<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:36.920> pressure<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.760> slight

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
and give it that pressure that slight

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.510 
and give it that pressure that slight
pressure<00:03:38.870> downward<00:03:39.440> on<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.590> tail<00:03:39.860> for<00:03:40.490> the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
pressure downward on the tail for the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.010 
pressure downward on the tail for the
front<00:03:40.790> foot<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> toe<00:03:41.300> should<00:03:41.510> be<00:03:41.630> hanging<00:03:41.810> off

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
front foot the toe should be hanging off

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.140 
front foot the toe should be hanging off
a<00:03:42.050> bit<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.470> that's<00:03:42.980> because<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.550> rotation<00:03:43.880> of

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
a bit and that's because the rotation of

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.330 
a bit and that's because the rotation of
the<00:03:44.300> shove-it<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.140> goes<00:03:45.320> forward<00:03:45.890> in<00:03:46.010> front<00:03:46.250> of

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
the shove-it it goes forward in front of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.850 
the shove-it it goes forward in front of
you<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:47.030> if<00:03:47.150> your<00:03:47.270> toes<00:03:47.450> are<00:03:47.630> already<00:03:47.870> off<00:03:48.110> this

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
you so if your toes are already off this

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.100 
you so if your toes are already off this
much<00:03:49.130> area<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.760> already<00:03:50.240> prepared<00:03:50.720> for<00:03:51.020> your

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
much area is already prepared for your

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.520 
much area is already prepared for your
foot<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.470> land<00:03:51.709> when<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.670> push<00:03:53.360> forward<00:03:53.720> so

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
foot to land when you push forward so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.160 
foot to land when you push forward so
that's<00:03:54.740> gonna<00:03:55.730> make<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.240> easier<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:56.900> your

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
that's gonna make it easier for your

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.130 
that's gonna make it easier for your
foot<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.890> land<00:03:58.130> since<00:03:59.060> your<00:03:59.570> foots<00:03:59.870> already

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
foot to land since your foots already

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.410 
foot to land since your foots already
closer<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:01.010> where<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.250> boards<00:04:01.520> or<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.240> crews

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
closer to where the boards or the crews

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.090 
closer to where the boards or the crews
are<00:04:02.570> gonna<00:04:02.750> be<00:04:02.959> on<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.380> front<00:04:03.530> foot<00:04:03.800> you<00:04:03.950> also

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
are gonna be on the front foot you also

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.350 
are gonna be on the front foot you also
want<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.400> put<00:04:04.550> pressure<00:04:04.670> right<00:04:05.000> here<00:04:05.180> in<00:04:05.270> the

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
want to put pressure right here in the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.180 
want to put pressure right here in the
center<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.930> want<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.140> put<00:04:06.230> pressure<00:04:06.380> against

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
center you want to put pressure against

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.220 
center you want to put pressure against
the<00:04:07.220> cruiser<00:04:07.520> because<00:04:08.240> that's<00:04:08.450> how<00:04:08.660> you're

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the cruiser because that's how you're

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.900 
the cruiser because that's how you're
gonna<00:04:09.350> prevent<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.040> cruiser<00:04:10.280> from<00:04:10.459> flipping

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
gonna prevent the cruiser from flipping

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.670 
gonna prevent the cruiser from flipping
over<00:04:11.090> because<00:04:11.870> since<00:04:12.170> when<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.410> put<00:04:12.560> that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
over because since when you put that

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.590 
over because since when you put that
pressure<00:04:12.830> down<00:04:13.130> you're<00:04:13.670> pushing<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.330> cruiser

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
pressure down you're pushing the cruiser

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.590 
pressure down you're pushing the cruiser
down<00:04:14.870> too<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.310> gonna<00:04:16.489> help<00:04:16.760> after<00:04:17.450> you

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.220 
put the pressure on the pocket with for
the<00:04:19.370> rotation<00:04:19.880> we're<00:04:20.390> gonna<00:04:20.540> help<00:04:20.840> with<00:04:21.080> the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
the rotation we're gonna help with the

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.810 
the rotation we're gonna help with the
pressure<00:04:21.440> pushing<00:04:21.859> down<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.220> front<00:04:22.520> to

you might land one foot you might land

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.610 
you might land one foot you might land
on<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.980> board<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.570> might<00:05:24.810> fall<00:05:25.110> forward
