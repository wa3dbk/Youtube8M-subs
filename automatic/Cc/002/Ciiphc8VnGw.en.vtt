to California took over six months to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.230 
to California took over six months to
build<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.310> truck<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.790> see<00:02:52.970> up<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
build and the truck that you see up the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.150 
build and the truck that you see up the
middle<00:02:53.480> that's<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.320> prime<00:02:54.500> example<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:55.040> a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
middle that's a prime example of a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.190 
middle that's a prime example of a
large-scale<00:02:55.610> prop<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.090> find<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:57.050> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
large-scale prop you find in the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.020 
large-scale prop you find in the
boneyard<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:58.160> could<00:02:58.310> do<00:02:58.400> very<00:02:58.520> well<00:02:58.640> driving

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
boneyard we could do very well driving

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.729 
boneyard we could do very well driving
up<00:02:59.300> there<00:02:59.480> though<00:02:59.630> since<00:02:59.959> there's<00:03:00.200> no<00:03:00.380> roads

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
up there though since there's no roads

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.070 
up there though since there's no roads
so<00:03:01.340> we<00:03:01.489> have<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.730> hoist<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.270> over<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.750> candy

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
so we have to hoist it over the candy

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.110 
so we have to hoist it over the candy
wall<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.530> crane<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.190> then<00:03:04.640> set<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.000> in

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
wall with a crane and then set it in

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.510 
wall with a crane and then set it in
place<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.530> then<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.739> think<00:03:06.980> they<00:03:07.130> set<00:03:07.370> the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
place and then I think they set the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.229 
place and then I think they set the
parking<00:03:07.760> brake<00:03:08.680> not<00:03:09.680> sure<00:03:09.920> about<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.370> anyway

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
parking brake not sure about that anyway

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.210 
parking brake not sure about that anyway
remember<00:03:11.540> -<00:03:11.870> Tony<00:03:12.140> we<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.470> even<00:03:12.590> recreate<00:03:13.070> the
