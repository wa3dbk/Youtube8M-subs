00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
okay there's been a lot of interest in

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.320 
okay there's been a lot of interest in
the<00:00:04.470> setup<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.040> I'm<00:00:05.430> using<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:06.000> get<00:00:06.120> these

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
the setup that I'm using to get these

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.520 
the setup that I'm using to get these
high<00:00:06.690> definition<00:00:07.760> fpv<00:00:08.760> videos<00:00:09.260> so<00:00:10.260> I'm<00:00:10.320> going

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
high definition fpv videos so I'm going

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.200 
high definition fpv videos so I'm going
to<00:00:10.559> show<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.950> setup<00:00:11.190> right<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:11.550> on<00:00:12.030> video

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
to show you the setup right now on video

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.360 
to show you the setup right now on video
what<00:00:13.080> could<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.380> more<00:00:13.559> appropriate

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
what could be more appropriate

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
what could be more appropriate
first<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.540> I'll<00:00:16.139> point<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> battery

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
first of all I'll point to the battery

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.140 
first of all I'll point to the battery
that's<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.630> FM<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.670> cell<00:00:20.670> pro<00:00:21.680> lithium<00:00:22.680> polymer

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
that's an FM a cell pro lithium polymer

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.900 
that's an FM a cell pro lithium polymer
3200<00:00:24.150> milliamps<00:00:24.840> 3<00:00:25.680> cells<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.430> point<00:00:26.760> one

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
3200 milliamps 3 cells one point one

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.349 
3200 milliamps 3 cells one point one
volts<00:00:27.859> I'm<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> put<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.910> there<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
volts I'm going to put that in there and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.560 
volts I'm going to put that in there and
show<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:32.120> just<00:00:33.120> set<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
show you how to do that just set it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.180 
show you how to do that just set it
right<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> try<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> make<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.680> easy<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
right there I try and make it easy to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.910 
right there I try and make it easy to
setup<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> velcro<00:00:37.860> strap<00:00:38.309> gonna

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
setup so just the velcro strap gonna

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.990 
setup so just the velcro strap gonna
cross-college<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.460> down<00:00:41.700> it's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
cross-college that thing down it's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.290 
cross-college that thing down it's
sitting<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.860> shelf<00:00:43.860> lining<00:00:44.489> which<00:00:44.670> holds

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
sitting on some shelf lining which holds

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020 
sitting on some shelf lining which holds
it<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.539> place<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.530> sticky<00:00:46.969> now<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it in place because it's sticky now the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.189 
it in place because it's sticky now the
motor<00:00:48.410> is<00:00:49.410> actually<00:00:49.829> set<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> bar<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:52.170> goes

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
motor is actually set on a bar that goes

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
motor is actually set on a bar that goes
into<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> cavity<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.850> way<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.210> could<00:00:54.480> see

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
into a cavity and the way you could see

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.130 
into a cavity and the way you could see
this<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.670> cavity<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.329> filled<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.780> foam

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
this and then cavity is filled with foam

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.450 
this and then cavity is filled with foam
so<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> motor<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.910> floats<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.829> grip

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so the motor actually floats in a grip

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.010 
so the motor actually floats in a grip
of<00:01:02.699> foam<00:01:03.379> like<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:06.270> did<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
of foam like this and I did that to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
of foam like this and I did that to
provide<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.770> vibration<00:01:10.610> absorption<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
provide some vibration absorption so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
provide some vibration absorption so
that<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> camera<00:01:12.960> gets<00:01:13.409> doesn't<00:01:14.340> get

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that the camera gets doesn't get

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.800 
that the camera gets doesn't get
vibrated<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.900> smoother<00:01:16.380> video<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.750> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
vibrated get smoother video and here I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.340 
vibrated get smoother video and here I
have<00:01:19.049> my<00:01:19.280> 500<00:01:20.280> milli<00:01:20.460> watt<00:01:20.700> 900<00:01:21.659> megahertz

actual downlink for the video I'm still

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.560 
actual downlink for the video I'm still
working<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> best<00:01:29.280> antenna<00:01:29.729> setup<00:01:30.299> but

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
working on the best antenna setup but

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.280 
working on the best antenna setup but
that's<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> stock<00:01:31.680> antenna<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.400> there<00:01:33.290> the

HD<00:01:39.470> 1a<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.000> I've<00:01:42.000> added<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.840> macro<00:01:43.530> lens<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
HD 1a and I've added a macro lens to it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.639 
HD 1a and I've added a macro lens to it
I'm<00:01:45.299> sorry<00:01:45.600> wide-angle<00:01:46.470> lens<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I'm sorry wide-angle lens so I can get a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.160 
I'm sorry wide-angle lens so I can get a
better<00:01:50.189> angle<00:01:51.030> view<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> fits<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.049> this

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
better angle view so that fits in this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.999 
better angle view so that fits in this
pocket<00:01:55.470> right<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.259> pocket<00:01:58.740> can

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
pocket right here and the pocket can

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
pocket right here and the pocket can
move<00:01:59.310> via<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.479> servo<00:02:02.299> some<00:02:03.299> degree<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.689> tilt

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
move via the servo some degree of tilt

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.319 
move via the servo some degree of tilt
down<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.250> look<00:02:05.369> down<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:05.969> how<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> get

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
down so I can look down that's how I get

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.070 
down so I can look down that's how I get
it<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.229> hinge<00:02:07.439> point<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.920> right<00:02:08.099> here<00:02:08.160> under

up<00:02:18.200> through<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.220> sends<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.000> video

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
up through here and then sends the video

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.690 
up through here and then sends the video
down

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
down

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.839 
down
I<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:23.810> try<00:02:24.049> plugging<00:02:24.379> this<00:02:24.739> in<00:02:25.010> here<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.640> my

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
I can try plugging this in here have my

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.190 
I can try plugging this in here have my
transmitter<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.819> see<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.299> care

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
transmitter on and you see the care

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.030 
transmitter on and you see the care
they've<00:02:30.410> moved<00:02:30.739> off<00:02:32.290> as<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.470> goes<00:02:33.650> through<00:02:33.680> its

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
they've moved off as it goes through its

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.320 
they've moved off as it goes through its
paces<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.849> have<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.180> set<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.450> my<00:02:35.750> 3-way<00:02:36.379> switch

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
paces I have it set on my 3-way switch

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.020 
paces I have it set on my 3-way switch
and<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.540> can<00:02:38.750> that's<00:02:38.989> down<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.250> normal<00:02:40.700> and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
and I can that's down this is normal and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.729 
and I can that's down this is normal and
that's<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.510> tilting<00:02:42.140> up<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.440> little<00:02:42.680> bit<00:02:44.739> so

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
that's just tilting up a little bit so

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.059 
that's just tilting up a little bit so
when<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.250> take<00:02:46.549> off<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.090> have<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:47.450> here<00:02:48.040> when<00:02:49.040> I

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
when I take off I have it here when I

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.059 
when I take off I have it here when I
get<00:02:49.310> up<00:02:49.430> high<00:02:49.640> I'll<00:02:50.030> put<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.329> down<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:51.140> then

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
get up high I'll put it down and then

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.009 
get up high I'll put it down and then
sometimes<00:02:52.640> when<00:02:52.819> I'm<00:02:52.970> lazy<00:02:53.180> I'll<00:02:53.540> go<00:02:53.690> all<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
sometimes when I'm lazy I'll go all the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.020 
sometimes when I'm lazy I'll go all the
way<00:02:54.170> like<00:02:54.379> that<00:02:57.310> it's<00:02:58.310> made<00:02:58.489> out<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.819> foam

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
way like that it's made out of foam

way like that it's made out of foam
board<00:02:59.390> it's<00:03:00.260> very<00:03:00.319> simple<00:03:00.920> design<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.700> got<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
board it's very simple design I got the
