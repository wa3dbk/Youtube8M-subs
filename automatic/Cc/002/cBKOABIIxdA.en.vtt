00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
know who once you know what are

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
know who once you know what are
different<00:01:52.920> channels<00:01:53.399> you're<00:01:53.610> gonna<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.060> want

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
different channels you're gonna you want

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.410 
different channels you're gonna you want
to<00:01:54.540> connect<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.610> then<00:01:56.610> second<00:01:57.030> thing<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to connect and then second thing is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.959 
to connect and then second thing is
define<00:01:57.930> your<00:01:58.110> target<00:01:58.320> audience<00:01:59.040> then<00:01:59.610> define

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
define your target audience then define
