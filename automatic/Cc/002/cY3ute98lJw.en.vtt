your car using an air impact wrench well
that<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> right<00:00:18.660> way<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
that is not the right way to do it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
that is not the right way to do it
you<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.300> these<00:00:21.300> air<00:00:21.720> impact<00:00:22.470> wrenches<00:00:23.100> have

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you see these air impact wrenches have

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.990 
you see these air impact wrenches have
grown<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.449> power<00:00:24.869> over<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.650> years<00:00:25.949> back<00:00:26.760> in

nine hundred foot-pounds of torque and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
nine hundred foot-pounds of torque and
when<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.620> look<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.489> realize<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
when you look at that and realize that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.510 
when you look at that and realize that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.930 
to hold the wheel on is 80 to 90 foot
pounds<00:00:51.239> well<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> imagine<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:53.280> over

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
pounds well you can imagine how over

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750 
pounds well you can imagine how over
tighten<00:00:54.449> some<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> these<00:00:54.989> lug<00:00:55.289> nuts<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.829> now

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
tighten some of these lug nuts are now

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
tighten some of these lug nuts are now
that's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.180> problem<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> almost

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that's a problem because it almost

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.459 
that's a problem because it almost
guarantees<00:00:59.070> warped<00:00:59.579> brake<00:00:59.910> rotors<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:01.109> only

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
guarantees warped brake rotors not only

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
guarantees warped brake rotors not only
that<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.460> suppose<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> flat<00:01:03.690> tire

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that but suppose you have a flat tire

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.630 
that but suppose you have a flat tire
and<00:01:04.229> you've<00:01:04.379> got<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:04.830> tightened<00:01:05.549> down

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and you've got one that's tightened down

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
and you've got one that's tightened down
to<00:01:06.090> five<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:07.020> six<00:01:07.290> hundred<00:01:07.350> foot-pounds<00:01:07.890> of

well<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> tools<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> car<00:01:10.470> even

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
well the tools that are in the car even

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.280 
well the tools that are in the car even
the<00:01:11.040> tools<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.150> might<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.140> the

the tools that you might have put in the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
the tools that you might have put in the
car<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.000> capable<00:01:15.299> of

car are not going to be capable of
loosening<00:01:16.680> those<00:01:16.890> lug<00:01:17.159> nuts

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
loosening those lug nuts

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.570 
loosening those lug nuts
so<00:01:18.119> you're<00:01:18.869> stranded<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> can't<00:01:20.250> get

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so you're stranded because you can't get

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
so you're stranded because you can't get
the<00:01:20.850> wheel<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> flat<00:01:21.900> tire<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the wheel off with the flat tire on it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.700 
the wheel off with the flat tire on it
now<00:01:23.520> what's<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> proper<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.200> proper<00:01:25.560> way

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
now what's the proper way the proper way

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.910 
now what's the proper way the proper way
is<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.280> use<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.909> torque<00:01:27.420> wrench<00:01:27.630> torque<00:01:28.560> wrench

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
is to use a torque wrench torque wrench

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.330 
is to use a torque wrench torque wrench
is<00:01:29.100> limit<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:30.360> torque<00:01:31.200> goes<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
is limit what torque goes on to the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
is limit what torque goes on to the
bolts<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:32.909> tight<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> should

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
bolts how tight they are and it should

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
bolts how tight they are and it should
be<00:01:34.829> used<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.549> about<00:01:35.670> everything<00:01:36.180> on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
be used on just about everything on

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.620 
be used on just about everything on
every<00:01:37.229> repair<00:01:37.710> now<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> people<00:01:39.240> thought

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
every repair now a lot of people thought

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.170 
every repair now a lot of people thought
that<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:40.079> these<00:01:40.320> electric<00:01:41.220> impact<00:01:41.700> wrenches

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that when these electric impact wrenches

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
that when these electric impact wrenches
came<00:01:42.479> out<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
came out that that was going to be the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.719 
came out that that was going to be the
answer<00:01:44.430> well<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.470> while<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.460> now

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
answer well it was for a while but now

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.469 
answer well it was for a while but now
these<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.350> over<00:01:49.710> 400<00:01:50.670> foot-pounds<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
these are up to over 400 foot-pounds of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.840 
these are up to over 400 foot-pounds of
torque<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.290> cases<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.549> four

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
torque in some cases so that's four

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240 
torque in some cases so that's four
times<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.259> amount<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.710> torque<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
times the amount of torque that is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.870 
times the amount of torque that is
needed<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.780> wheels<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.219> most<00:01:59.610> other

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
needed for the wheels and most other

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510 
needed for the wheels and most other
things<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.630> automobile<00:02:01.070> again<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
things on an automobile again back to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
things on an automobile again back to
the<00:02:02.880> torque<00:02:03.119> wrench

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the torque wrench

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.889 
the torque wrench
now<00:02:04.110> AC<00:02:04.439> Delco<00:02:05.130> has<00:02:05.310> reversed<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.060> trend<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
now AC Delco has reversed this trend to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.609 
now AC Delco has reversed this trend to
more<00:02:07.879> powerful<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.060> more<00:02:09.270> powerful<00:02:10.020> tools

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
more powerful and more powerful tools
