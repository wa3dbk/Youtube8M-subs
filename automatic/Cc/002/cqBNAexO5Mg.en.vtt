obviously we came up to frustrate us and
all<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.530> obviously<00:01:35.070> weren't<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> come

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
all we obviously weren't going to come

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.010 
all we obviously weren't going to come
out<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> play<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> play<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
out and play the play it was in the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.840 
out and play the play it was in the
second<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.500> where<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:41.280> heart<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
second off where my heart was in the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.609 
second off where my heart was in the
mouth<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.750> probably<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.439> was

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
mouth I think it was probably that was

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.460 
mouth I think it was probably that was
yeah<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.759> two-on-one<00:01:45.420> any<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.320> it
