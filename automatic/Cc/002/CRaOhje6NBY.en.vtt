00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810 

my<00:00:00.480> logic<00:00:00.750> of<00:00:01.110> success<00:00:01.500> pledged<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.580> pledge

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
my logic of success pledged the pledge

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.430 
my logic of success pledged the pledge
is<00:00:03.030> something<00:00:03.360> I<00:00:03.449> came<00:00:03.510> up<00:00:03.689> with<00:00:03.870> because

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
is something I came up with because

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.710 
is something I came up with because
truth<00:00:04.740> be<00:00:04.920> told<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.430> didn't<00:00:06.150> know<00:00:06.240> how<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> end<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
truth be told I didn't know how to end a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.660 
truth be told I didn't know how to end a
presentation<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.250> said<00:00:08.429> well<00:00:08.490> let<00:00:08.610> me

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
presentation and so I said well let me

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.250 
presentation and so I said well let me
do<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.880> whole<00:00:09.059> little<00:00:09.300> rhyme<00:00:09.660> thing<00:00:10.080> that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
do this whole little rhyme thing that

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.350 
do this whole little rhyme thing that
sounded<00:00:10.620> kind<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.830> cute<00:00:11.130> but<00:00:11.790> when<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.030> first

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
sounded kind of cute but when I first

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
sounded kind of cute but when I first
started<00:00:12.660> doing<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.500> was<00:00:13.920> very<00:00:14.099> basic<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
started doing it it was very basic and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.129 
started doing it it was very basic and
then<00:00:14.940> he<00:00:15.000> basically<00:00:15.269> took<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> life<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.960> its

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
then he basically took on a life of its

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.330 
then he basically took on a life of its
own<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.320> you're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> see<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> end

so what I do now is I end all my
speeches<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> logic<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.910> success
