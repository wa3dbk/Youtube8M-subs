it's definitely worth checking out and
using<00:01:28.470> before<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.549> judge<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:30.270> judge<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
using before you judge it don't judge it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690

really<00:01:49.470> interesting<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.009> watch<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.640> not

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
really interesting to watch it's not

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.639 
really interesting to watch it's not
what<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.210> would<00:01:51.329> expect<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.170> highly

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
what you would expect so I highly

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.469 
what you would expect so I highly
recommend<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.159> check<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> 13<00:01:54.000> stops<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
recommend to check that 13 stops to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
recommend to check that 13 stops to
dynamic<00:01:54.899> range<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> camera<00:01:55.740> also<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
dynamic range on the camera also is that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.120 
dynamic range on the camera also is that
real<00:01:57.030> or<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.020> say<00:01:58.229> oh<00:01:58.259> no<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
real or like what we say oh no it is a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.240 
real or like what we say oh no it is a
real<00:01:59.430> 13s<00:01:59.969> got<00:02:00.119> ya<00:02:00.540> 13<00:02:01.170> stops<00:02:01.439> dynamic<00:02:02.040> range

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
real 13s got ya 13 stops dynamic range

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.800 
real 13s got ya 13 stops dynamic range
that's<00:02:02.520> pretty<00:02:02.850> much<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> same<00:02:03.780> thing

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that's pretty much that's the same thing

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.860 
that's pretty much that's the same thing
as<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:05.060> as<00:02:06.060> an

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
as a as an

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.150 
as a as an
in<00:02:06.960> trouble<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.530> same<00:02:07.710> thing<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.980> nap

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
in trouble it's the same thing as a nap

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.280 
in trouble it's the same thing as a nap
but<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.729> pretty<00:02:08.850> close<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.960> pretty<00:02:10.140> there

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
but it's pretty close it's pretty there

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.600 
but it's pretty close it's pretty there
it's<00:02:10.440> pretty<00:02:10.619> much<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.800> same<00:02:11.040> thing<00:02:11.100> it's<00:02:11.520> a

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
not only comes with the davinci resolve

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.600 
not only comes with the davinci resolve
software<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.650> does<00:03:16.830> come<00:03:17.070> with<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> ultra

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610

software but it does come with the ultra
scope<00:03:17.820> software<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.510> could<00:03:18.780> run<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
scope software so you could run the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.229 
scope software so you could run the
Thunderbolt<00:03:19.620> directly<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.310> your<00:03:20.489> laptop<00:03:20.970> and

Thunderbolt directly to your laptop and

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.479 
Thunderbolt directly to your laptop and
look<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:21.930> your<00:03:22.050> scopes<00:03:22.350> ok<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.190> let's<00:03:23.340> talk<00:03:23.430> a

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
look at your scopes ok so let's talk a

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.040 
look at your scopes ok so let's talk a
little<00:03:23.580> bit<00:03:23.850> about<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> accessory<00:03:24.450> sensory

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
little bit about the accessory sensory
