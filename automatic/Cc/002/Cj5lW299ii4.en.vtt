I<00:00:00.030> recently<00:00:00.570> well<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.639> recently

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
I recently well this is the recently

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.780 
I recently well this is the recently
recalled<00:00:03.030> after<00:00:03.629> two<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.529> same<00:00:04.770> cars<00:00:05.130> what

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
recalled after two of the same cars what

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.089 
recalled after two of the same cars what
look<00:00:05.970> at<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.180> suddenly<00:00:06.660> burst<00:00:06.870> into<00:00:07.020> flames

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
look at this suddenly burst into flames

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.570 
look at this suddenly burst into flames
oh<00:00:08.660> yeah<00:00:09.660> they<00:00:10.200> stole<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> thing<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.190> see<00:00:11.370> you

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
oh yeah they stole the thing you see you

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.190 
oh yeah they stole the thing you see you
couldn't<00:00:12.000> really<00:00:12.150> call<00:00:12.360> him<00:00:12.540> stupid<00:00:12.750> because

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
couldn't really call him stupid because

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.650 
couldn't really call him stupid because
obviously<00:00:13.590> he<00:00:14.070> had<00:00:14.340> no<00:00:14.580> idea<00:00:14.969> did<00:00:15.269> he<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.570> were

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
obviously he had no idea did he you were

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.060 
obviously he had no idea did he you were
just<00:00:15.900> uh<00:00:16.190> they<00:00:17.190> did<00:00:17.430> he<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.330> look<00:00:18.830> well<00:00:19.830> no

I didn't have no no you were just

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.960 
I didn't have no no you were just
unlucky<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.260> wasn't<00:00:22.529> expected<00:00:22.830> oh<00:00:23.100> yes<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
unlucky it wasn't expected oh yes a

unlucky it wasn't expected oh yes a
better<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.539> same<00:00:24.750> time<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.350> mention<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.890> Wow

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
better the same time to mention that Wow

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.480 
better the same time to mention that Wow
cars<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.779> links<00:00:28.050> nicely<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.769> does<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> the

cars it links nicely to this does it the
same<00:00:29.519> harm<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.960> sad<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
same harm to really was sad for the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
same harm to really was sad for the

when<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.119> your<00:01:12.450> length<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.470> quadruple

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
when you have your length you quadruple

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.490 
when you have your length you quadruple
your<00:01:14.400> spin<00:01:14.850> speed<00:01:17.240> good<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.320> now

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
your spin speed good so you are now

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.350 
your spin speed good so you are now
looking<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> science<00:01:20.729> behind<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.330> of

person<00:01:25.229> science<00:01:25.770> show<00:01:26.159> hello<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:27.090> serious

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
person science show hello it's serious

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.890 
person science show hello it's serious
it's<00:01:27.840> educational<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.520> yes<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
it's educational it is yes well if you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.450 
it's educational it is yes well if you
think<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.229> quite<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.500> clever<00:01:32.220> combination

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
think it's quite a clever combination

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
think it's quite a clever combination
because<00:01:33.270> you've<00:01:33.479> got<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.079> hand<00:01:34.350> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
because you've got on the one hand it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
because you've got on the one hand it's
people<00:01:35.070> falling<00:01:35.520> flat<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.880> their<00:01:35.970> faces<00:01:36.210> but

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
people falling flat on their faces but

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.640 
people falling flat on their faces but
on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> other<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> voyage<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
on the other it is a voyage of

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.330 
on the other it is a voyage of
scientific<00:01:40.650> discovery

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
scientific discovery

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.179 
scientific discovery
it<00:01:41.790> has<00:01:42.000> integrity<00:01:42.360> sincerity<00:01:43.200> depth<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
it has integrity sincerity depth in

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.160 
it has integrity sincerity depth in
Dayton<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> kind<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> prevents<00:01:45.869> people

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
Dayton and it kind of prevents people

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
Dayton and it kind of prevents people
from<00:01:46.409> making<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> same<00:01:47.009> mistakes<00:01:47.220> doesn't<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
from making the same mistakes doesn't it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.149 
from making the same mistakes doesn't it
so<00:01:48.180> expensive<00:01:48.360> well<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
so expensive well actually that's a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.710 
so expensive well actually that's a
serious<00:01:50.490> point<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.180> mean<00:01:51.420> throughout

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
serious point because I mean throughout

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.410 
serious point because I mean throughout
the<00:01:51.899> series<00:01:52.110> there<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.470> oh<00:01:52.770> sorry

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the series there are oh sorry

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
the series there are oh sorry
yeah<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.350> seen<00:01:55.560> him<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.860> watch<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.369> yeah<00:01:56.820> he

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
yeah you seen him you watch it yeah he

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.280 
yeah you seen him you watch it yeah he
did<00:01:57.210> watch<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.990> know<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
did watch it and then when you know the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.929 
did watch it and then when you know the
slow<00:01:58.469> modes<00:01:58.710> are<00:01:58.860> coming<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.430> as

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
slow modes are coming up it's just as

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.870 
slow modes are coming up it's just as
painful<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.649> point<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.640> just

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
painful I know but the point is you just

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.359 
painful I know but the point is you just
said<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.060> prevention<00:02:03.689> hmm<00:02:04.409> cuz<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.189> was<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
said about prevention hmm cuz I was a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.709 
said about prevention hmm cuz I was a
bit<00:02:05.520> nervous<00:02:05.640> about<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.090> when<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.299> said<00:02:06.509> do

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
bit nervous about that when they said do

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
bit nervous about that when they said do
it<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.170> essentially<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> show<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.129> made<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.489> of

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
it so essentially the show is made up of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.460 
it so essentially the show is made up of
you<00:02:09.270> watch<00:02:09.450> clips<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.869> people<00:02:09.899> doing<00:02:10.200> stupid

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you watch clips of people doing stupid

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.140 
you watch clips of people doing stupid
things<00:02:10.679> where<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.580> trying<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> jump<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
things where they it's trying to jump a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.180 
things where they it's trying to jump a
bicycle<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.840> do

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
bicycle or do

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.130 
bicycle or do
yeah<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.450> all<00:02:14.540> goes<00:02:14.660> horribly<00:02:14.810> wrong<00:02:15.110> and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
yeah and it all goes horribly wrong and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.690 
yeah and it all goes horribly wrong and
then<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.380> pop<00:02:15.560> up<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.890> explain<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.310> science

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
then I pop up and explain the science

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.790 
then I pop up and explain the science
and<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:16.910> use<00:02:17.060> graphics<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.020> act<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.410> we

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
and we use graphics and act as we

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.710 
and we use graphics and act as we
created<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.850> see<00:02:20.000> exactly<00:02:20.120> what's<00:02:20.480> gone

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
created and you see exactly what's gone

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.300 
created and you see exactly what's gone
wrong<00:02:20.900> whether<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:21.500> more<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.800> conservation

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
wrong whether it's more the conservation

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.650 
wrong whether it's more the conservation
of<00:02:22.370> angular<00:02:22.490> momentum<00:02:23.180> or<00:02:23.270> whatever<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
of angular momentum or whatever the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.900 
of angular momentum or whatever the
theories<00:02:23.990> behind<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.530> um-hmm<00:02:25.460> um<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:25.820> it's

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
theories behind it um-hmm um so it's

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.280 
theories behind it um-hmm um so it's
very<00:02:26.060> credible<00:02:26.330> but<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.540> thought<00:02:26.750> we<00:02:26.900> exactly

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
very credible but I thought we exactly

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.740 
very credible but I thought we exactly
there<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.040> people<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.330> do<00:02:29.630> it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
there what if people see it and do it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.870 
there what if people see it and do it
I'd<00:02:29.900> fear<00:02:30.140> bad<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:31.040> know<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.550> last

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
I'd fear bad you know what the last

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.130 
I'd fear bad you know what the last
thing<00:02:32.030> you'll<00:02:32.240> want<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.510> do<00:02:32.690> after<00:02:32.990> watching

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
thing you'll want to do after watching

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.900 
thing you'll want to do after watching
all<00:02:33.560> these<00:02:33.800> shows<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.400> any<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.880> things

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
all these shows is do any of the things

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.150 
all these shows is do any of the things
you<00:02:35.180> see<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.200> also<00:02:36.500> because<00:02:36.950> there's

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
you see but it is also because there's

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.430 
you see but it is also because there's
something<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.700> us<00:02:37.850> all<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.240> think<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.690> laughs

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
something in us all I think that laughs

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.630 
something in us all I think that laughs
when<00:02:39.950> people<00:02:40.990> do<00:02:41.990> you<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.560> sugars<00:02:43.100> Celia

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
when people do you like the sugars Celia

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.490 
when people do you like the sugars Celia
I<00:02:43.850> do<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.120> don't<00:02:44.600> believe<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.930> laughs<00:02:45.140> as<00:02:45.320> well

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I do I don't believe you laughs as well

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.380 
I do I don't believe you laughs as well
I<00:02:45.650> always<00:02:45.980> laugh<00:02:46.490> when<00:02:46.700> somebody<00:02:47.030> Falls<00:02:47.240> day

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
I always laugh when somebody Falls day

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.970 
I always laugh when somebody Falls day
but<00:02:47.510> when<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.720> laugh<00:02:47.930> when<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.170> follow<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.860> to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
but when I laugh when I follow the to

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.340 
but when I laugh when I follow the to
mind<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.460> I<00:02:49.490> get<00:02:49.790> cross<00:02:50.120> when<00:02:50.420> somebody<00:02:50.780> in

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
mind you I get cross when somebody in

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.500 
mind you I get cross when somebody in
laughs<00:02:51.650> when<00:02:51.980> I'm<00:02:52.100> flat<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.670> my<00:02:52.820> face<00:02:52.940> I'm<00:02:53.270> sure

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
laughs when I'm flat on my face I'm sure

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.020 
laughs when I'm flat on my face I'm sure
it<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:54.020> it's<00:02:54.470> human<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:55.040> course<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.730> think

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
it is it's human of course it is I think

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.270 
it is it's human of course it is I think
we<00:02:56.150> laugh<00:02:56.360> because<00:02:56.710> we're<00:02:57.710> glad<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.070> not<00:02:58.160> us

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
we laugh because we're glad it's not us

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.520 
we laugh because we're glad it's not us
is<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.450> she<00:02:59.510> said<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.140> wasn't<00:03:00.350> always

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
is that she said I wasn't always

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.060 
is that she said I wasn't always
constraint<00:03:01.160> yes<00:03:01.880> exactly<00:03:02.210> and<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:03.230> would<00:03:03.800> last

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
constraint yes exactly and it would last

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.800 
constraint yes exactly and it would last
you<00:03:04.310> when<00:03:04.460> you<00:03:04.550> cook<00:03:04.760> yeah<00:03:05.150> I'm<00:03:05.390> fine<00:03:05.600> I'll

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
you when you cook yeah I'm fine I'll

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.790 
you when you cook yeah I'm fine I'll
quit<00:03:06.850> no<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.120> think<00:03:08.480> somebody<00:03:08.930> else<00:03:08.990> falls<00:03:09.350> over

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
quit no I think somebody else falls over

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.710 
quit no I think somebody else falls over
we<00:03:10.100> laughs<00:03:10.310> it's<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.670> an<00:03:10.940> expulsion<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
we laughs it's just an expulsion of

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.630 
we laughs it's just an expulsion of
energy<00:03:12.050> because<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.410> not<00:03:12.530> yeah<00:03:12.950> basically

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
energy because it's not yeah basically

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.880 
energy because it's not yeah basically
do<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:14.420> do<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.870> say<00:03:15.140> whether<00:03:15.410> people<00:03:15.740> hurt

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
do you do you say whether people hurt

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.130 
do you do you say whether people hurt
themselves<00:03:15.920> on<00:03:16.490> your<00:03:16.640> program<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.810> do<00:03:17.959> oh

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
themselves on your program you do oh

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.930 
themselves on your program you do oh
yeah<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.680> mean<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.040> quite<00:03:19.250> awesome<00:03:19.430> they

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
yeah I mean it's quite awesome they

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.060 
yeah I mean it's quite awesome they
really<00:03:20.300> do<00:03:20.510> yeah<00:03:20.840> no<00:03:21.050> massive<00:03:21.500> bombing<00:03:21.770> yeah

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
really do yeah no massive bombing yeah

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.410 
really do yeah no massive bombing yeah
and<00:03:22.190> not<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.400> me<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:22.610> everything<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.150> look<00:03:23.300> at

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
and not to me and everything you look at

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.220 
and not to me and everything you look at
weightlifters<00:03:24.050> and<00:03:24.260> very<00:03:25.360> exact<00:03:26.360> or<00:03:26.660> I<00:03:26.690> will

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
weightlifters and very exact or I will

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.810 
weightlifters and very exact or I will
the<00:03:27.380> hole<00:03:27.530> even<00:03:27.560> though<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.430> is

the hole even though it is
scientifically<00:03:29.450> rigorous<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.110> explained<00:03:30.530> it

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
scientifically rigorous and explained it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.900 
scientifically rigorous and explained it
has<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.890> because<00:03:31.160> natural<00:03:31.459> National
