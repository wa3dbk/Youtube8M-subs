00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.680
 classic a witch 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.110

 make a beautiful hairstyle 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.280
 exaggerated all over cotton or again 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:55.100
 you could have a high tail 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.670
 with the camber on the front in short 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.820
 I would say the suitable term seen 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.010
 that they approach him or bury you 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.700
 with laughter 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.580
 that's right i am going to now 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.280
 do some witchcraft that e 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.630
 meanwhile I leave you to the tutorial 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.340
 hi I have already created my base now 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.920
 with an angled brush I go to get it 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.959
 a black eye shadow and I'm going to redesign the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.079
 my eyebrows giving it a shape 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.850
 very extravagant upwards for 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.850
 make my look worse 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.700
 soon to learn a palette of the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.200
 slick this original 594 eagle 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.910
 these posts are really beautiful 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400
 and super students I'm going to get 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.000
 now purple to spread it over the whole 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000
 my mobile eyelid 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.770
 now I take these beautiful greens 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.200
 military and with a gradient brush 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.880
 if it is not the eye crease 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.050
 sfumandolo decent and bringing much 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.050
 upwards and outwards 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.630
 that same angled brush as before 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.030
 and the black eyeshadow 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.550
 I'm going to draw a line parallel to 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.800
 that of my eyebrow departing 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.170
 from the lower rim of the eye and then 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.980
 with small taps it faded the color 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.980
 upward 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.030
 with black when tracing some lines 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.030
 in my lower eyelid 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.470
 with a gradient brush I go back to 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.560
 take in purple and apply it over the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.390
 black playing the ensemble then returned to mine 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.250
 very trustworthy angled brush and I go to 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.740
 trace this time a line in the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.660
 fold of the eye that I go to blend towards 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.350
 the outside and upwards always with 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.350
 small taps 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.650
 and let's not forget to fade then it is 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.720
 very important is the military green of 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.000
 before I go also to apply below 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.830
 my brow at least in 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.490
 the one I created and then 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.900
 in the inner corner of the eye 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.390
 now I'm going to serve an eyeliner 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.550
 in gel to create a line on mine 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.650
 eyelashes and then go do this 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.120
 tongue down in the 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.700
 in the inner corner of my eye for 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.450
 make the look even worse and 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.190
 then with a black hunt I go to 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.960
 color the outside of mine 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.780
 eyelid and then to play it with a 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.030
 brush I pick up the purple for per 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:25.930
 accentuate to intensify the most 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:28.900
 color and then I bring it also under this 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.800
 black line I had created on mine 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.850
 times fading very very well 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.260
 under all my own eye for 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.310
 its entire length 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.750
 as you see it becomes almost large and with 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.490
 a trick of that sort would say just that 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.120
 could not miss a nice pair of 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.250
 fake eyelashes of showy extravagances e 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.470
 not to forget then to merge it with 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.560
 ours with a bit of mascara I'm going to do 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.480
 a bit with touring with 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.350
 a very dark land to tell the truth 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.440
 used an eye shadow of a very tone 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.380
 cold and I'm going to pass over that su 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.310
 under the cheekbones also on the temples and 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.960
 then with a thin brush I also go to 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.240
 redefine my nose then fading 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.240
 well with both the brush and the waist 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.730
 I also decide to make mine 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.010
 contouring under the cheekbones a little 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.870
 extravagant is what I'm going to do with 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.600
 a brush to shade from June 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.610
 first a shade of orange and then one 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.260
 shade of yellow also decides to 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.960
 add a detail to the eyes with 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:45.080
 of the gilded first to the inner corner e 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.350
 then under the arched eyebrows like 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.060
 lipstick a very showy lilac 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.190
 certainly extravagant and then I go to 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.860
 redefine my lips with a pencil 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.640
 black that I'm going to blend then towards 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.640
 the interior 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.340
 to finish my lips better 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.080
 I take the purple with my fingers again 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.419
 one above 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.419
 and here is the makeup is finished 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.580
 and also with this tutorial we have 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.979
