00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.500
 is something like disgusting 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.960
 she just kisses me but that was 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.359
 really funny why did she know that 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.669
 this is so funny to me 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:31.720
 I know but I believe she has 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:34.030
 anything to do with school 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.950
 I actually wanted to have it with Jesse 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.280
 but somehow it does not tick anymore 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.280
 right 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.719
 they wait what why are you crying I 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.600
 I do not like him you are the one 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.370
 the whole thing too weird to say that 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 right there just with another 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.170
 point I do not have it at all 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.740
 finally home away from this 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.740
 problem 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.790
 I'd better take the back door otherwise 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.549
 I still notice my value and then 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:33.390
 come back the questions at least 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.390
 I would be fine here 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.219
 maybe I'm being led by computer games 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:51.520
 You do not have any advertising yet 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.909
 you can not stand alone anymore 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.909
 turn it off 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.030
 hello I knew it I knew that is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.399
 the wood I thought you told him 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.739
 it is like the russian place what is 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.090
 just happens with another one 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.239
 snugly comfortable what where like with the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 evil horse you know I know 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.440
 not why he did that when 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.920
 I give them the fingers they are 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.370
 not worth jesse mouse now my ask 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.410
 you know the ball is tomorrow too 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.000
 Yes I know 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.130
 I actually wanted with kim us 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.950
 on tim I do not have any 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.290
 Accompaniment how would it be if we just 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.420
 as best friends go without stress 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.269
 with these guys yes that's one 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.660
 good idea 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.769
 if I think I'm going what that no 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.080
 is not in question 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:09.370
 for you not from the spot I'm the same 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:22.959
 maybe this will distract me now 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:24.700
 little bit better if she's me 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.120
 I wish I could say that 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.120
 I only tell you one thing you go to the ball 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.010
 but I no no no I let 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.570
 not so I will not let you at all 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.799
 fall into this room with your peace 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.120
 problem alone that is nice of you and 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.660
 that is why with me to the ball no 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.570
 argument 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.570
 yes, that's the one thing he was 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.109
 I do not have the 1 that's right 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.850
 Not 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.859
 let's check that in vain then 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.560
 Let's begin 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.959
 how it looks from omas pond 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.109
 that is already the tenth art will be 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.049
 I show I told you I have 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:09.810
 nothing you see okay you're right 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.810
 there is only one solution that would be
