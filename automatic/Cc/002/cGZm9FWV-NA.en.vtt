00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
it dry for a wire that's when you use

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.330 
it dry for a wire that's when you use
your<00:05:15.280> your<00:05:16.280> shine<00:05:16.820> which<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:17.840> it's<00:05:18.590> not<00:05:18.919> so<00:05:19.160> bad

because<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.970> don't<00:05:20.750> really<00:05:20.870> like<00:05:20.990> lossy<00:05:21.970> glossy

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
because I don't really like lossy glossy

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.990 
because I don't really like lossy glossy
red<00:05:23.300> lipstick<00:05:23.840> I<00:05:24.080> really<00:05:25.010> like<00:05:25.160> the<00:05:25.310> matte<00:05:25.610> and

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
red lipstick I really like the matte and

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.339 
red lipstick I really like the matte and
that's<00:05:26.330> why<00:05:26.479> I<00:05:26.510> like<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:26.900> red<00:05:27.050> Russian

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
that's why I like the red Russian

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.770 
that's why I like the red Russian
because<00:05:27.500> I'm<00:05:27.800> Matt<00:05:27.979> red<00:05:28.190> lipstick<00:05:28.599> so<00:05:29.599> what

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
because I'm Matt red lipstick so what

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.400 
because I'm Matt red lipstick so what
this<00:05:29.990> is<00:05:30.289> just<00:05:30.349> basically<00:05:33.190> feels<00:05:35.140> the<00:05:36.140> color

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
this is just basically feels the color

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.710 
this is just basically feels the color
and<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:37.640> gives<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:37.970> a<00:05:38.060> little<00:05:38.240> bit<00:05:38.450> of<00:05:38.570> shine

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
and it gives it a little bit of shine

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.290 
and it gives it a little bit of shine
but<00:05:41.720> it's<00:05:41.900> subtle<00:05:42.169> it's<00:05:42.530> not<00:05:42.830> too<00:05:43.580> much<00:05:43.849> so<00:05:44.270> I

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
but it's subtle it's not too much so I

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.390 
but it's subtle it's not too much so I
can<00:05:44.659> deal<00:05:44.690> with<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.409> kind<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.890> shine<00:05:46.070> it's

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
can deal with that kind of shine it's

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.550 
can deal with that kind of shine it's
