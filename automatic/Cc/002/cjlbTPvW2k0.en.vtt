wear and tear facts for your 2d mobile

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.980 
wear and tear facts for your 2d mobile
game<00:00:07.859> art<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:09.000> gonna<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.389> pretty<00:00:09.630> quick

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
game art so it's gonna be pretty quick

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.379 
game art so it's gonna be pretty quick
and<00:00:10.200> easy<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.280> let's<00:00:11.849> start<00:00:13.849> so<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.240> just

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
and easy so let's start so here I'm just

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.019 
and easy so let's start so here I'm just
creating<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.289> basic<00:00:16.740> shape<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.670> flag

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
creating the basic shape of the flag

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.370 
creating the basic shape of the flag
where<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.930> add<00:00:19.170> our<00:00:19.199> torn<00:00:20.039> effects<00:00:20.730> later

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
where we can add our torn effects later

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.759 
where we can add our torn effects later
so<00:00:25.880> then<00:00:26.880> after<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.630> gonna<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:28.050> creating

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
so then after that I'm gonna be creating

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.669 
so then after that I'm gonna be creating
these<00:00:29.250> shapes<00:00:29.580> where<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> shape

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
these shapes where we can use the shape

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.370 
these shapes where we can use the shape
builder<00:00:31.890> tool<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.579> delete<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:33.630> parts<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
builder tool to delete these parts and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.750 
builder tool to delete these parts and
have<00:00:35.070> our<00:00:35.250> torn<00:00:35.850> effect<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.190> can<00:00:38.190> draw

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
have our torn effect so you can draw

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
have our torn effect so you can draw
them<00:00:38.910> anywhere<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:40.170> any<00:00:40.410> place<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
them anywhere or at any place of the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.270 
them anywhere or at any place of the
flag<00:00:41.550> now<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.989> I'm<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.530> adding<00:00:43.739> more

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
flag now so I'm so I'm just adding more

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.600 
flag now so I'm so I'm just adding more
hair<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> sides<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.590> be<00:00:46.590> creative<00:00:47.520> on

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
hair on the sides just be creative on

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 
hair on the sides just be creative on
this<00:00:47.670> part<00:00:48.090> don't<00:00:48.870> need<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.530> too<00:00:49.710> clean

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this part don't need to be too clean

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
this part don't need to be too clean
because<00:00:50.370> we're<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> delete<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
because we're just going to delete the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.889 
because we're just going to delete the
access<00:00:52.670> areas<00:00:53.670> by<00:00:53.969> using<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.420> shape<00:00:54.629> builder

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
access areas by using the shape builder

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.889 
access areas by using the shape builder
tool<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:58.590> by<00:00:58.800> pressing<00:00:58.980> shift<00:00:59.399> M<00:00:59.640> or<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.690> shape

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
tool so by pressing shift M or the shape

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.460 
tool so by pressing shift M or the shape
builder<00:01:01.109> tool<00:01:01.520> we<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.899> delete<00:01:03.899> these<00:01:04.110> areas

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
builder tool we can delete these areas

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.940 
builder tool we can delete these areas
by<00:01:04.650> pressing<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.670> dragging<00:01:06.119> over<00:01:06.330> them

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
by pressing out and dragging over them

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.690 
by pressing out and dragging over them
so<00:01:07.950> I'll<00:01:08.250> delete<00:01:08.580> those<00:01:09.030> areas<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.580> on<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
so I'll delete those areas and on this

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.030 
so I'll delete those areas and on this
we're<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.090> gonna<00:01:12.390> add<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.810> torn<00:01:13.409> areas<00:01:13.799> at

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
we're just gonna add more torn areas at

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.359 
we're just gonna add more torn areas at
the<00:01:14.520> bottom<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> flag<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.560> sauce<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the bottom of the flag like sauce and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.870 
the bottom of the flag like sauce and
just<00:01:17.640> repeat<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> steps<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.229> did

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
just repeat all the steps that we did

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.960 
just repeat all the steps that we did
and<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.119> pretty<00:01:21.420> simple<00:01:22.460> again<00:01:23.460> shape

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and it's pretty simple again shape

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.539 
and it's pretty simple again shape
builder<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.810> alt<00:01:25.140> drag<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
builder then alt drag so we're just

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.179 
builder then alt drag so we're just
gonna<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.150> adding<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.689> simple<00:01:28.229> flag<00:01:28.439> color<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
gonna be adding a simple flag color so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.560 
gonna be adding a simple flag color so
that<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.640> distinguish<00:01:30.210> our<00:01:31.110> design<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.289 

then<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:36.750> gonna<00:01:36.960> create<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.000> shapes<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
then I'm gonna create the shapes for the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.740 
then I'm gonna create the shapes for the
cutout<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.310> ships<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:42.329> make<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
cutout or the ships that will make the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.190 
cutout or the ships that will make the
holes<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:43.350> flag<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.979> by<00:01:45.049> selecting<00:01:46.049> them

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
holes for our flag and by selecting them

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
holes for our flag and by selecting them
and<00:01:46.229> using<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> shape<00:01:47.250> builder<00:01:47.460> tool<00:01:47.640> again

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and using the shape builder tool again

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
and using the shape builder tool again
we<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.570> easily<00:01:48.780> create<00:01:49.079> holes<00:01:49.799> inside<00:01:50.460> our

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
we can easily create holes inside our

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.929 
we can easily create holes inside our
flag<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.100> make<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.549> dark

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
flag so I'm just gonna make a dark

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.270 
flag so I'm just gonna make a dark
background<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> clearly

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
background here so we can see it clearly

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.780 
background here so we can see it clearly
and<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.259> created<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.770> hole<00:01:58.979> so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and now you see it created a hole so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.319 
and now you see it created a hole so
I'll<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.570> creating<00:02:01.079> more<00:02:01.259> holes<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
I'll just be creating more holes and

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.600 
I'll just be creating more holes and
using<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> shape<00:02:03.600> builder<00:02:03.810> tool<00:02:04.549> I'll<00:02:05.549> click

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
using the shape builder tool I'll click

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
using the shape builder tool I'll click
there<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.540> will<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.930> deleted<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:09.470> that's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
there so it will be deleted so that's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.490 
there so it will be deleted so that's
pretty<00:02:10.950> simple<00:02:11.580> that's<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
pretty simple that's all it is

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.300 
pretty simple that's all it is
and<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.910> part<00:02:15.180> I'm<00:02:15.390> creating<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.310> The

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and in this part I'm creating the The

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.570 
and in this part I'm creating the The
Thorn<00:02:17.580> effect<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> holes<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.430> we<00:02:20.430> will

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
Thorn effect for the holes and we will

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.640 
Thorn effect for the holes and we will
be<00:02:20.730> converting<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.480> into<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.050> brush<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
be converting this into a brush so that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.090 
be converting this into a brush so that
we<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.100> easily<00:02:23.700> create<00:02:24.500> many<00:02:25.500> parts<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
we can easily create many parts of the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.760 
we can easily create many parts of the
flag<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.060> brush<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:31.260> I'm<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.590> gonna

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
flag with this brush so I'm just gonna

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.750 
flag with this brush so I'm just gonna
open<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.190> brush<00:02:32.670> panel<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:34.400> I'm<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.610> gonna

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
open the brush panel and I'm just gonna

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.820 
open the brush panel and I'm just gonna
drag<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.390> drop<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.690> inside<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.900> then<00:02:39.900> select

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
drag and drop it inside and then select

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.310 
drag and drop it inside and then select
art<00:02:41.040> brush<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.910> press<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.630> or<00:02:45.930> select

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
art brush so just press the or select

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.010 
art brush so just press the or select
the<00:02:46.440> tints<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:46.890> shades<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:48.020> default

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
the tints and shades the default

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
the tints and shades the default
settings<00:02:49.470> are<00:02:49.620> pretty<00:02:49.680> much<00:02:50.190> okay<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:51.330> can

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
settings are pretty much okay and we can

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.960 
settings are pretty much okay and we can
just<00:02:51.720> rename<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.320> brush<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.580> our<00:02:53.700> case

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
just rename the brush so in our case

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.720 
just rename the brush so in our case
we're<00:02:54.300> gonna<00:02:54.570> name<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.470> tear<00:02:55.860> fall<00:02:56.220> off<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
we're gonna name this tear fall off and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.990 
we're gonna name this tear fall off and
press<00:02:57.720> ok<00:02:58.110> and<00:03:00.230> then<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.380> can<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.740> brush<00:03:02.000> or

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000

press ok and then you can just brush or
paint<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.510> inside<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.380> flag<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:06.240> has<00:03:06.480> a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
paint it inside the flag and it has a

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.730 
paint it inside the flag and it has a
stroke<00:03:07.950> where<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.550> edit<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.840> just

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
stroke where you can edit it so just

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.430 
stroke where you can edit it so just
select<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.190> anchor<00:03:11.459> points<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.140> drag<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
select the anchor points and drag and it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.979 
select the anchor points and drag and it
will<00:03:13.680> update<00:03:13.890> easily<00:03:14.760> pretty<00:03:15.240> neat<00:03:15.540> huh<00:03:15.650> and

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
will update easily pretty neat huh and

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.080 
will update easily pretty neat huh and
that's<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.590> draw<00:03:19.920> other<00:03:20.280> parts<00:03:20.730> like

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
that's it we can draw other parts like

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.570 
that's it we can draw other parts like
like<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:25.140> this<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> similar<00:03:25.920> brush<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
like so so this is the similar brush and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.900 
like so so this is the similar brush and
I'm<00:03:27.300> creating<00:03:27.690> now<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.140> whole<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.680> want<00:03:28.950> for

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
I'm creating now the whole I want for

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.400 
I'm creating now the whole I want for
this<00:03:30.410> effect<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.690> will<00:03:36.870> make<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.080> whole

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
this effect and I will make a whole

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.220 
this effect and I will make a whole
again<00:03:37.560> by<00:03:38.190> using<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.790> shape<00:03:39.000> builder<00:03:39.209> tool<00:03:39.300> so

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
again by using the shape builder tool so

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.320 
again by using the shape builder tool so
that's<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:43.130> now<00:03:44.130> I'm<00:03:44.250> just<00:03:44.430> adding<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.940> shadow

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
that's it now I'm just adding a shadow

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.670 
that's it now I'm just adding a shadow
it's<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> simple<00:03:46.320> shadow

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
it's a simple shadow

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.530 
it's a simple shadow
it's<00:03:46.890> basically<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.430> duplicate<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.330> base

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
it's basically a duplicate of the base

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.039 
it's basically a duplicate of the base
shape<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.400> just<00:03:50.400> turn<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.570> multiply

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
shape and just turn it on to multiply

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.539 
shape and just turn it on to multiply
now<00:03:53.010> I'm<00:03:53.220> adding<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:54.680> other<00:03:55.680> effects<00:03:56.070> for<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
now I'm adding the other effects for the

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.050 
now I'm adding the other effects for the
shadow<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:58.049> there<00:03:58.410> there<00:03:59.130> was<00:03:59.310> our<00:03:59.459> darkest

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
shadow so there there was our darkest

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.870 
shadow so there there was our darkest
part<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:01.470> side<00:04:01.709> I'm<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.070> gonna<00:04:02.700> be

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
part and this side I'm just gonna be

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.710 
part and this side I'm just gonna be
creating<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:04.080> light<00:04:04.470> part<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:06.180> these<00:04:06.510> light

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
creating the light part so these light

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.750 
creating the light part so these light
parts<00:04:07.019> are<00:04:07.170> in<00:04:07.350> screen<00:04:07.769> mode<00:04:07.980> while<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.580> dark

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
parts are in screen mode while the dark

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.150 
parts are in screen mode while the dark
parts<00:04:09.060> are<00:04:09.180> in<00:04:09.330> multiply<00:04:09.980> blending<00:04:10.980> mode<00:04:11.190> so

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
parts are in multiply blending mode so

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.560 
parts are in multiply blending mode so
you<00:04:14.160> can<00:04:14.340> test<00:04:14.489> other<00:04:14.640> blending<00:04:15.060> modes<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.420> you

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
you can test other blending modes if you

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.320 
you can test other blending modes if you
want<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.019> just<00:04:16.049> think<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.220> both<00:04:18.180> of

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
want I just think that this both of

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.039 
want I just think that this both of
these<00:04:18.450> blending<00:04:19.080> modes<00:04:19.620> are<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.970> best<00:04:21.299> when

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
these blending modes are the best when

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.170 
these blending modes are the best when
creating<00:04:22.560> designs<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:23.789> this

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
creating designs like this

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.860 
creating designs like this
so<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.320> basically<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:26.220> so

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
so this basically it so

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.600 
so this basically it so
in<00:04:26.930> this<00:04:27.080> tutorial<00:04:27.260> we've<00:04:27.830> learned<00:04:28.190> how<00:04:28.580> to

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
in this tutorial we've learned how to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.180 
in this tutorial we've learned how to
create<00:04:29.169> wear<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.320> tear<00:04:30.440> effects<00:04:31.930> using<00:04:32.930> the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
create wear and tear effects using the

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.850 
create wear and tear effects using the
help<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:34.370> shape<00:04:34.760> builder<00:04:35.030> tools<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.860> basic

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
help of shape builder tools and basic

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.260 
help of shape builder tools and basic
blending<00:04:37.490> modes<00:04:37.699> so<00:04:38.389> here<00:04:39.139> is<00:04:39.410> my<00:04:39.910> final<00:04:40.910> flag

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
blending modes so here is my final flag

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.960 
blending modes so here is my final flag
so<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.690> added<00:04:42.110> my<00:04:42.260> logo<00:04:42.500> here<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:42.830> added<00:04:43.669> some

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
so I added my logo here and added some

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.629 
so I added my logo here and added some
details<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:45.020> like<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.500> spatter<00:04:45.800> effect<00:04:46.340> and

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
details to it like a spatter effect and

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.390 
details to it like a spatter effect and
just<00:04:47.419> made<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.810> landing<00:04:48.590> mode<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:49.010> multiply

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
just made the landing mode to multiply

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.070 
just made the landing mode to multiply
and<00:04:50.060> turned<00:04:50.960> it<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.560> very<00:04:51.830> low<00:04:52.070> opacity<00:04:52.370> and

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
and turned it to a very low opacity and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.430 
and turned it to a very low opacity and
that's<00:04:54.080> it

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
that's it

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.290 
that's it
