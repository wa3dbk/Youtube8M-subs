access to memory yeah you have two more
memory<00:01:29.490> modules<00:01:30.229> beneath<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.250> Bay

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
memory modules beneath this this Bay

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.609 
memory modules beneath this this Bay
here<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:34.790> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.329> battery<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.079> okay

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
here and this is the battery here okay

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:46.550 
here and this is the battery here okay
let's<00:01:38.460> pop<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> 200

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
let's pop it up one and it's it is 200

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
let's pop it up one and it's it is 200
milliamps<00:01:46.890> 56<00:01:47.729> watt<00:01:47.880> hour<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.750> same

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
milliamps 56 watt hour so the same

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.880 
milliamps 56 watt hour so the same
battery<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> 1259<00:01:51.140> let's<00:01:52.140> put<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> back

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
battery as on the 1259 let's put it back

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.230 
battery as on the 1259 let's put it back
now<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.390> slides<00:01:54.570> very<00:01:55.049> easily<00:01:55.229> in

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
now you can see it slides very easily in

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.819 
now you can see it slides very easily in
what's<00:01:57.240> cool<00:01:57.450> about<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.780> battery<00:01:58.259> design<00:01:58.590> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
what's cool about the battery design is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.050 
what's cool about the battery design is
as<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.479> bit<00:02:02.060> it's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
as you can see it is a little bit it's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.209 
as you can see it is a little bit it's
not<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.840> integrated<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> design<00:02:05.009> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
not really integrated to the design and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.570 
not really integrated to the design and
get<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:06.869> hump<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.429> quite

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
get this little hump here which is quite

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.699 
get this little hump here which is quite
good<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.330> allows<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.050> grab<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
good because it allows you to grab it

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.120 
good because it allows you to grab it
like<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.580> easily<00:02:12.360> carry<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> device
