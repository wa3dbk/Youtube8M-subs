the mouthpiece now some ligatures the
threads<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.420> down<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.320> most<00:02:01.619> mine

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
threads go down here on most mine

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.910 
threads go down here on most mine
actually<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.360> top<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.990> mouthpiece<00:02:04.469> so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
actually are on top of the mouthpiece so

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.219 
actually are on top of the mouthpiece so
there<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:05.850> different<00:02:06.180> kinds<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.780> ligatures

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
there are different kinds of ligatures

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.050 
there are different kinds of ligatures
now<00:02:07.439> we're<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> tighten<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.250> ligature

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
now we're going to tighten that ligature

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.880 
now we're going to tighten that ligature
up<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:09.840> want<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.110> crank<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.619> too

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
up and we don't want to crank on it too

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
up and we don't want to crank on it too
hard<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.319> want<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:13.770> of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
hard we just want to kind of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.080 
hard we just want to kind of
get<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:15.020> tight<00:02:15.410> holds<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.490> reed

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090
