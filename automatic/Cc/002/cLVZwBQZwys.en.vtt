00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
so basically Rockstar Games said that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.230 
so basically Rockstar Games said that
they<00:01:51.440> were<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:51.860> far<00:01:51.890> into<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.520> development<00:01:53.000> of

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
they were so far into the development of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.920 
they were so far into the development of
GTA<00:01:53.900> 3<00:01:54.410> that<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.850> was<00:01:55.970> too<00:01:56.150> late<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.510> just<00:01:56.690> scrap

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
GTA 3 that it was too late to just scrap

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.300 
GTA 3 that it was too late to just scrap
the<00:01:56.960> whole<00:01:57.140> game<00:01:57.410> because<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.830> what<00:01:57.950> happened

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
the whole game because of what happened

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.970 
the whole game because of what happened
so<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.760> lot<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.510> like<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.720> said<00:01:59.780> was<00:02:00.140> cosmetic

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
so a lot of it like I said was cosmetic

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.550 
so a lot of it like I said was cosmetic
changes<00:02:01.400> nothing<00:02:01.580> extraordinary<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
changes nothing extraordinary so the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.100 
changes nothing extraordinary so the
first<00:02:03.980> one<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:05.240> game<00:02:05.570> was<00:02:05.750> delayed<00:02:05.930> a

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
first one is that the game was delayed a

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.990 
first one is that the game was delayed a
little<00:02:06.320> bit<00:02:06.470> due<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.920> fact<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.370> Rockstar

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
little bit due to the fact that Rockstar

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.580 
little bit due to the fact that Rockstar
Games<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.539> headquarter<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.229> New<00:02:09.349> York

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
Games in the headquarter in New York

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.160 
Games in the headquarter in New York
City<00:02:09.890> was<00:02:10.459> located<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.239> close<00:02:11.269> to<00:02:11.810> Ground<00:02:12.050> Zero

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
City was located so close to Ground Zero

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.900 
City was located so close to Ground Zero
that<00:02:12.709> they<00:02:12.920> were<00:02:12.980> affected<00:02:13.520> as<00:02:13.670> just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
that they were affected as just

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.330 
that they were affected as just
emotionally<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.860> tragedy

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
emotionally and just the tragedy

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.130 
emotionally and just the tragedy
affected<00:02:16.760> them<00:02:16.880> overall<00:02:17.210> as<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> whole<00:02:17.630> not

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
affected them overall as a whole not

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.320 
affected them overall as a whole not
only<00:02:18.290> due<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.040> their<00:02:19.160> location<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:19.940> because

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
only due to their location but because

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.320 
only due to their location but because
of<00:02:20.360> what<00:02:20.960> actually<00:02:21.230> happened<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
of what actually happened so the the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.050 
of what actually happened so the the
first<00:02:23.360> real<00:02:23.900> change<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.530> gta3<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.459> 9/11

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
first real change to gta3 that 9/11

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.380 
first real change to gta3 that 9/11
affected<00:02:26.420> was<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.550> colors<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.209> cop

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
affected was the the colors of the cop

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.020 
affected was the the colors of the cop
cars<00:02:29.630> those<00:02:29.900> were<00:02:30.020> actually<00:02:30.410> changed<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.160> look

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
cars those were actually changed to look

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.900 
cars those were actually changed to look
less<00:02:32.390> like<00:02:32.420> those<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.220> police<00:02:34.640> cars

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
less like those of the the police cars

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.090 
less like those of the the police cars
in<00:02:35.150> New<00:02:35.360> York<00:02:35.630> City<00:02:35.900> which<00:02:36.140> they<00:02:36.350> were<00:02:36.410> loosely

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
in New York City which they were loosely

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.550 
in New York City which they were loosely
based<00:02:37.250> off<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.900> first<00:02:39.050> place<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.530> I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
based off of in the first place and I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.620 
based off of in the first place and I
believe<00:02:39.590> Liberty<00:02:40.490> City<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.880> gta3<00:02:41.270> was

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
believe Liberty City and gta3 was

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.170 
believe Liberty City and gta3 was
loosely<00:02:41.959> based<00:02:42.230> off<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.830> grand<00:02:43.700> theft<00:02:43.850> auto<00:02:44.060> 3

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
loosely based off of grand theft auto 3

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.350 
loosely based off of grand theft auto 3
but<00:02:44.600> not<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.800> full<00:02:45.950> extent<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.520> GTA<00:02:46.970> 4

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
but not to the full extent that GTA 4

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.770 
but not to the full extent that GTA 4
was<00:02:47.390> now<00:02:48.550> flight<00:02:49.550> paths<00:02:49.850> if<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.630> if<00:02:50.750> you

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
was now flight paths if you see if you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.900 
was now flight paths if you see if you
played<00:02:51.080> GTA<00:02:51.380> 3<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.800> will<00:02:51.920> see<00:02:52.100> random<00:02:52.610> planes

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
played GTA 3 you will see random planes

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.510 
played GTA 3 you will see random planes
just<00:02:53.090> flying<00:02:53.540> around<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.959> map<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.520> rockstar

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
just flying around the map and rockstar

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.979 
just flying around the map and rockstar
games<00:02:55.730> actually<00:02:55.970> had<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.330> alter<00:02:56.570> those<00:02:56.690> flight

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
games actually had to alter those flight

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.690 
games actually had to alter those flight
paths<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.560> way<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.860> didn't<00:02:58.130> look<00:02:58.220> like<00:02:58.280> they

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
paths that way it didn't look like they

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.640 
paths that way it didn't look like they
were<00:02:58.730> or<00:02:59.269> one<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.600> these<00:02:59.720> planes<00:02:59.989> was<00:03:00.200> crashing

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
were or one of these planes was crashing

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.370 
were or one of these planes was crashing
into<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> building<00:03:01.010> or<00:03:01.550> flying<00:03:02.450> behind<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:03.170> s

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
into a building or flying behind a s

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.800 
into a building or flying behind a s
skyscraper<00:03:04.010> they<00:03:04.220> didn't<00:03:04.489> want<00:03:04.700> anybody<00:03:05.510> to

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
skyscraper they didn't want anybody to

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.390 
skyscraper they didn't want anybody to
get<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.989> wrong<00:03:06.200> idea<00:03:06.350> from<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.250> they

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
get the wrong idea from that so they

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.920 
get the wrong idea from that so they
altered<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.850> flight<00:03:08.060> paths<00:03:08.330> now<00:03:08.630> there<00:03:08.840> was

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
altered the flight paths now there was

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080 
altered the flight paths now there was
also<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.980> think<00:03:10.190> this<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:10.430> pretty<00:03:10.610> eerie<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
also and I think this is pretty eerie a

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.110 
also and I think this is pretty eerie a
a<00:03:11.360> mission<00:03:11.900> where<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.530> were<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.220> hijack<00:03:13.910> a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
a mission where you were to hijack a

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.350 
a mission where you were to hijack a
dodo<00:03:14.630> little<00:03:15.110> airplane<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.940> fly<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.209> and

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
dodo little airplane and fly that and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.290 
dodo little airplane and fly that and
crash<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.870> into<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:19.519> building<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.940> Donald

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
crash it into the building of Donald

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.930 
crash it into the building of Donald
love<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.780> antagonist<00:03:21.470> in<00:03:21.680> GTA<00:03:22.190> 3<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.760> think

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
love and antagonist in GTA 3 and I think

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.240 
love and antagonist in GTA 3 and I think
that's<00:03:23.120> really<00:03:23.299> eerie<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:25.040> was<00:03:25.220> a

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
that's really eerie that that was a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.460 
that's really eerie that that was a
mission<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.820> first<00:03:26.000> place<00:03:26.299> before<00:03:26.750> 9/11

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
mission in the first place before 9/11

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.020 
mission in the first place before 9/11
even<00:03:27.829> happened<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:28.549> they<00:03:28.700> ended<00:03:28.940> up

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
even happened and then they ended up

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.370 
even happened and then they ended up
removing<00:03:29.209> this<00:03:29.600> mission<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.200> just<00:03:30.890> do<00:03:31.070> too<00:03:31.489> I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
removing this mission I just do too I

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.630 
removing this mission I just do too I
basically<00:03:33.380> after<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.829> affair<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.370> the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
basically after the affair the the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.600 
basically after the affair the the
events<00:03:34.880> of<00:03:34.970> 9/11<00:03:35.200> directly<00:03:36.610> associating

gta3 Box art was actually changed and

the<00:04:07.790> final<00:04:08.150> version<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:08.810> was<00:04:09.079> different

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
the final version of that was different

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.310 
the final version of that was different
than<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.680> one<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.549> UK<00:04:10.970> saw<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:11.720> III

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
than the one that the UK saw so III

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.440 
than the one that the UK saw so III
really<00:04:12.680> thought<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.250> UK<00:04:13.820> version<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.329> it

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
really thought the the UK version of it

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.000 
really thought the the UK version of it
was<00:04:14.570> really<00:04:14.720> cool<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.019> didn't<00:04:15.470> know<00:04:15.560> about<00:04:15.680> this

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
was really cool I didn't know about this

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.529 
was really cool I didn't know about this
now<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.220> always<00:04:16.549> wonder<00:04:16.910> why<00:04:17.090> there<00:04:17.299> was<00:04:17.390> two

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
now I always wonder why there was two

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.479 
now I always wonder why there was two
different<00:04:17.660> versions<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.440> box<00:04:18.650> art<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.160> I

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
different versions of the box art and I

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.009 
different versions of the box art and I
had<00:04:19.609> no<00:04:19.760> idea<00:04:19.910> that<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.539> was<00:04:20.630> directly

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
had no idea that it was directly

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.219 
had no idea that it was directly
correlated<00:04:21.650> with<00:04:21.769> 9/11<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.660> u.s.<00:04:23.990> box

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
correlated with 9/11 and the u.s. box

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.779 
correlated with 9/11 and the u.s. box
art<00:04:24.500> was<00:04:24.620> changed<00:04:25.039> because<00:04:25.190> they<00:04:25.490> felt<00:04:25.729> that

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
art was changed because they felt that

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.290 
art was changed because they felt that
it<00:04:25.970> was<00:04:26.120> too<00:04:26.330> raw<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.410> have<00:04:28.039> after<00:04:28.940> the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
it was too raw to I have after the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
it was too raw to I have after the
events<00:04:29.599> of<00:04:29.690> 9/11<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.320> they<00:04:30.470> quickly<00:04:30.710> changed

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
events of 9/11 so they quickly changed

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.650 
events of 9/11 so they quickly changed
and<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:32.220> this<00:04:32.430> box<00:04:32.730> art<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.090> was<00:04:33.150> developed

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
and that this box art that was developed

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.340 
and that this box art that was developed
after<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.880> events<00:04:35.880> of<00:04:35.940> 9/11<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.690> replace<00:04:37.080> this

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
after the events of 9/11 to replace this

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.010 
after the events of 9/11 to replace this
other<00:04:37.590> one<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:38.120> actually<00:04:39.120> what<00:04:39.510> became<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
other one is actually what became the
