00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
knowledge of the sort of thing I was

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.569 
knowledge of the sort of thing I was
looking<00:00:26.570> for<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:27.349> right<00:00:27.560> sort<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.829> price<00:00:28.220> the

right sort of functionality and in my

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
book I believe that Connect provided to

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.870 
book I believe that Connect provided to
all<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.469> sort<00:00:33.890> of<00:00:33.920> straightaway<00:00:34.430> the

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
all of that sort of straightaway the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.010 
all of that sort of straightaway the
best<00:00:35.120> way<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.390> could<00:00:35.540> describe<00:00:35.780> the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
best way that I could describe the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.869 
best way that I could describe the
efficiencies<00:00:36.620> that<00:00:36.649> we<00:00:36.950> have<00:00:37.190> is<00:00:37.460> probably<00:00:37.760> by

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
efficiencies that we have is probably by

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.270 
efficiencies that we have is probably by
comparison<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.840> there<00:00:39.379> are<00:00:39.559> shops<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.219> know

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
comparison and there are shops I know

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.630 
comparison and there are shops I know
fairly<00:00:40.760> local<00:00:41.180> who<00:00:41.629> have<00:00:41.989> gone<00:00:42.379> down<00:00:43.129> as<00:00:43.430> well

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
fairly local who have gone down as well

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.760 
fairly local who have gone down as well
more<00:00:43.820> manual<00:00:44.239> routes<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.660> I<00:00:44.750> know<00:00:44.809> that<00:00:45.260> it

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
more manual routes and I know that it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.610 
more manual routes and I know that it
takes<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.220> lot<00:00:46.400> of<00:00:46.610> time<00:00:46.910> for<00:00:47.240> them<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.420> actually

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
takes a lot of time for them to actually

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.720 
takes a lot of time for them to actually
do<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.740> back-office<00:00:48.920> stuff<00:00:49.490> not<00:00:49.700> just

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
do the back-office stuff not just

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.490 
do the back-office stuff not just
dropping<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.480> day<00:00:50.630> there<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:50.960> early<00:00:51.320> in<00:00:51.410> the

just-in-time approach to my stock

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.320 
just-in-time approach to my stock
holding<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.040> don't<00:01:28.310> have<00:01:28.520> huge<00:01:28.909> amounts<00:01:29.240> of

holding so I don't have huge amounts of
stock<00:01:29.570> there<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:30.020> only<00:01:30.320> have<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:30.710> enough<00:01:31.010> to

stock there I only have it enough to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.039 
stock there I only have it enough to
keep<00:01:31.400> me<00:01:31.549> going<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.030> month<00:01:32.360> or<00:01:32.659> two<00:01:32.810> months

keep me going for a month or two months
whatever<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.440> think<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.920> appropriate<00:01:34.280> for<00:01:35.030> that
