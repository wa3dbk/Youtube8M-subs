00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:18.740
 bring to your attention 3 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.740
 he on and nest for laying hens 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:30.210
 feature of this nest is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:34.860
 that it consists of two parts 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 nest box and receiver egg tray 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.660
 which allows 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.559
 eggs to gather in a certain place 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.559
 after laying chickens demolished 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.190
 This design has three sections. 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:01:01.110
 made of plywood thickness 15 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.220
 millimeters front wall is made of 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:12.030
 four chennai boards 20 millimeters 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.680
 This design has a top cover 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.920
 galvanized coated 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.009
 iron and installed under a certain 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 slope so that the chicken was uncomfortable 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:32.920
 there is also a catch on top 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:39.479
 plastic to cover the holes 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.479
 nests so that the chickens do not sleep in the nests and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.270
 cap 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.600
 where do the eggs come from 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.579
 now we will show it all 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.460
 then the first element of the lid is open 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:01.869
 it is made to be comfortable 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.229
 access to the nests themselves so that they can 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.160
 was to serve 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.209
 peek peek inside 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.209
 in which condition 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.270
 so close the cap are also available 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.930
 frame racks 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:32.070
 4 pieces that allow this nest 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.750
 hang on the wall do not put on 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.060
 stand in this case we have a nest 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.800
 stands on a metal stand 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.570
 profile welded from metal 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.130
 60 section by 40 section 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.980
 but you can also attach this nest to 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:53.510
 wall with these four 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:58.380
 frame stands bottom 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.430
 nests have a certain bias in 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.280
 egg side of the receiver which 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:12.480
 the eggs are rolling down this egg 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:17.280
 receiver open the lid here at 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.950
 us going to testicles after 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.780
 the chicken rushing they ships roll off 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.820
 and for ease of cleaning the bottom of the nest 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.250
 done still face planochka 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.130
 opening so that you can 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.130
 garbage that is generated as a result 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.250
 visiting chickens of these nests 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.040
 there are going to be some manure residue 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.989
 wool fluff so that it can all be 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:54.600
 quietly from the nest clean and remove 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:57.989
 Now through these openings and of 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.350
 demonstrate how the egg rolls into 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.280
 this receiver's eggs looks close 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.280
 face bar 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.560
 close the lid put the egg 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:32.720
 one egg and opening here please 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:38.150
 eggs on the spot approach elect collect 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.220
 quite apart from that 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.250
 what plastic shutter spoke 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.100
 which allows you to block the entrance when 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.310
 chickens all reacted so they did not climb 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.050
 hand over to the internal they spent the night there 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.440
 such plastic for 2 beetles 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:08.000
 demonstrate all three nests closed 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:12.530
 second thing we open well what else is there 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.729
 how to add means three-section 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.330
 you can make one sectional nests 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:22.070
 two-section in this case is done 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.289
 three-section per nest per 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.880
 five chickens 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:32.210
 if your farm has less than 15 hens 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.650
 This can be done in two sections or 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:42.070
 several single sectional nests want 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:46.760
 add that nest hole 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:51.740
 made with offset to the left 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:55.300
 the nest itself has a width of 50 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.450
 centimeters deep 40 centimeters a 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.000
 the entrance to the hole of the hole diameter of 25 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.880
 centimeters and she is not on 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.760
 the middle of the socket is shifted to the left in order 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.750
 to 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.810
 it was more dark and calm 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.690
 space in the chicken to the right of the entrance to 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.840
 nest 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:25.150
 In this case, you can demonstrate 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:30.040
 open the cover means this is clearly 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.800
 seen nest entrance slot into the holes 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:39.900
 located to the left 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.900
 not in the center but the nest itself has a zone 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.870
 darkened which allows 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:53.080
 in a more relaxed environment of chickens there 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:56.580
 settle for laying eggs on this 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.580
 all close
