 and then everyone every year is that one more 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.180
 video and I thought that after two 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.730
 months I'm coming back there and there are several 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.160
 Dear faces, I'm going to talk to everyone 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.869
 to start this video there I separated a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.349
 very funny scene when it was free 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.439
 na and pando and this guy there that put me 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.390
 mess up my quiet and but it came 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.160
 with everything goes jumping it contributed the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'll get caught, I ended up taking 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 this chap and neck 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.050
 But this is it, man, so get started. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.290
 here is we separate the good because it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.110
 to stay a month out there first 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.090
 I want to thank you, it 's one thousand subscribers. 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.130
 fucking thousand subscribers 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.620
 Bye, thank you very much, go. 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.540
 thank you it is to know that 100 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.570
 thousand people who enjoy my work are 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.670
 very satisfying to see many people like this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.150
 You can leave my registration here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.430
 but for who is ours to whom it is 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.220
 starting now it goes inscribed is very 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.860
 we are a lot of people come a lot of people 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.310
 even and I hope it keeps growing 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.590
 and if that number and that like this 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.409
 number grow grow together also my 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.550
 work and evolve more and more of my 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.530
 content 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.510
 So that's it , I'm going to say that the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.430
 reasons for having stayed a month 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.000
 I asked why I stopped put 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.830
 videos 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.290
 A lot of people asked if I left the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.530
 channel and there are several factors 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.420
 you must have noticed the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.210
 difference is a certain difference and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.030
 video that finally man I bought a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.310
 new headset and the strategy and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.260
 microsoft lx3 saw that the best 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.960
 cost-effective I think it has the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.000
 of his voice and the quality of his 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 audio is perfect old if you want 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.729
 do the comparison here of an old video 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 my old beach comfort with this video 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.440
 here and now that you are going to watch 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.759
 difference 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.739
 so come on 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.140
 this was one of the problems're not day 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.819
 recording does not have a microphone 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.040
 quality 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.599
 now I have and also bringing video 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.230
 for you 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.379
 other 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.090
 factor I moved and who knows how to 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:29.310
 change in this whole bureaucracy of 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.500
 ask for internet transfer 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.290
 the technician has to evaluate his 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.069
 region if the operator that covers 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.430
 that region there and is a 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.760
 protocol to fucking bureaucracy and this 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.140
 it also took time and what 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.930
 happened later 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.090
 after that I got internet beauty and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.519
 Touch 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.860
 I lived very close to the beach and 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.620
 take too close to the beach had to 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.690
 Question of the sea of caria maresia fudeu 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.340
 as the pcc has no concept but it was me 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.209
 same kind of salt as I do my pieces 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:13.530
 practically that we rodeo damaged 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.859
 a lot of things and took some time there 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.629
 so another time out and another 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.870
 factor is that I am now 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:25.349
 working late at night comes the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.859
 class has not been told because it only has 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.489
 The morning is free and tomorrow passes sleeping. 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:34.500
 because in our time nothing is going to get 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.260
 even just for the weekend and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.530
 look there to play and burn out 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.419
 do all this over the weekend and I 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.430
 I want to leave a tip for you, here it is. 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.109
 to that which will serve to others not 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.630
 but I want to try to give a maximum number 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.329
 of people and what I got is then 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.190
 always take as reference a flag 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.230
 and if in case you want to play long 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.169
 distances is as for example still 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.569
 walking is always 965 meters from the 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.859
 Way is how you can see then it is 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.780
 which it is easy for you to decorate 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.799
 parameters if you always play in the same 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.780
 in the same place and always analyzes his 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.349
 adversary as in the case of this situation 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.930
 So I stand there just watching him and 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.849
 stop in case me moving to it 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.609
 do not hit me he moves three times 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.949
 to the left is whenever she takes 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.780
 so it was easy to put a little 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.160
 his left that I knew he would 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.180
 head shakes me 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.710
 how can you see there? 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.080
 so an important tip is always 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.789
 analyzes your opponent 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.979
 else never neighborhoods where a 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.710
 server full of snipers as you can 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.539
 to see the face there was very easy to hit 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.630
 when he laid down on the ground under the goal 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.669
 so never use bay it may be full 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.610
 to snipe that you will become a target 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.160
 very easy because of course the target 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.220
 stop becomes very easy to hit 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.740
 for it is still obviously bad hari 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.240
 damn it 's like you can see the guy 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.880
 was to reveal under the mountain he 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.479
 it's going to power and it was very easy to 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.880
 hit it and of course it is not necessary that 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.560
 Inep always have patience so you 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.720
 will always be against situations like 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.550
 this is where your opponent is never in the 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.720
 Exactly what you want it to always do 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.759
 moves to and fro 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.830
 so take it but never stay in a place 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.139
 Where do you want it to be then? 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.180
 In this fight, the guy who does not 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.020
 soft on the drive and the one that 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.020
 have more patience 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.840
 Another thing that I ask myself is 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.630
 about type parameters like I do 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.159
 presenting a guy who is there is like 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.909
 I can introduce a guy over a thousand 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.470
 meters 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.080
 How much do I have to raise my sights? 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.729
 to hit this guy is good how much 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.310
 you have to lift the sights design 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:52.430
 this guy will vary accordingly for each 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.669
 suit because cali bullets in pe has 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.320
 the speed of each different then the 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.699
 compensation will have to be different 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.740
 for each of them 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.419
 one more tip I have here that is 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.110
 very simple and practical was that 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:09.169
 The first one I said takes as a point of 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.240
 for example as per 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.919
 example the flag is as I do in 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.610
 khandan wool 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.500
 I am always 965 meters from the eco and 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.729
 for the simple fact of always being 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.099
 playing in the same place when I play 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.800
 on this map I'll end up decorating the 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:26.570
 I will end up in color parameters where 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.490
 I have to aim at each location that 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.020
 is over a thousand meters the body I 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.550
 I have to get up and introduce myself to the guy. 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.810
 that is more than one thousand meters 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.130
 so it will not be good for you to ask me 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.190
 kind of where you're going to have to improve for 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.380
 be a guy that I accumulate because every 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.450
 location will be a different parameter 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.300
 how far you outta this 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.550
 then it is very complicated and for 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.890
 decorating takes a while but how 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.600
 said as everyone knows if the inep 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.850
 have patience it will never be the 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.280
 suits and advice I can give 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.890
 here for you if you really want 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.160
 learn the young dinapro service that 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.900
 enough in the perspective that with 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.070
 many gaps in its tail 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.620
 You will learn to have a drive. 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.690
 the better you will learn to be more agile 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.610
 Yeah man 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.920
 The more difficulty you have the more 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.870
 experienced you will end up being so it is 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.390
 Only that I can tell you are 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.830
 very simple tips but I think you can 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.960
 help a lot 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.280
 So that's it folks I hope 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.070
 have liked to know that the mayor 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.080
 I'm sorry again 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.820
 for the absence and I 'm sorry if I say 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.160
 It was a bullshit and it did not make sense as 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.440
 I said is this is new in this stop 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.140
