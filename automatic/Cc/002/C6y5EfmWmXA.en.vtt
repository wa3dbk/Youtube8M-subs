00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.689 

now<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:53.050> bananas<00:04:53.500> go<00:04:53.919> through<00:04:54.220> very

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
now the the bananas go through very

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.230 
now the the bananas go through very
quickly<00:04:54.759> and<00:04:55.770> they<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:57.699> can<00:04:57.880> see<00:04:58.090> it's

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
beginning to look like banana ice cream

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.430 
beginning to look like banana ice cream
it<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.910> actually<00:05:01.090> looks<00:05:01.599> like<00:05:01.720> vanilla<00:05:02.050> ice

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
it it actually looks like vanilla ice

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.700 
it it actually looks like vanilla ice
cream<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.550> with<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.479> almond<00:05:05.080> butter<00:05:05.319> in<00:05:05.410> it

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
cream and with the almond butter in it

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.180 
cream and with the almond butter in it
we<00:05:05.889> call<00:05:06.099> it<00:05:06.280> almond<00:05:06.789> butter<00:05:07.030> ice<00:05:07.270> cream<00:05:08.190> so

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
we call it almond butter ice cream so

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.830 
we call it almond butter ice cream so
it'd<00:05:09.250> be<00:05:09.400> good<00:05:09.550> for<00:05:09.819> diabetics<00:05:10.240> because

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
it'd be good for diabetics because

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.670 
it'd be good for diabetics because
bananas<00:05:11.319> happen<00:05:11.949> to<00:05:12.690> be<00:05:13.690> high<00:05:13.990> in<00:05:14.289> sugar<00:05:14.590> and

bananas happen to be high in sugar and

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.050 
bananas happen to be high in sugar and
so<00:05:15.009> mixed<00:05:15.280> with<00:05:15.750> some<00:05:17.490> almonds<00:05:18.490> would<00:05:18.729> be<00:05:18.880> good

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
so mixed with some almonds would be good

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.790 
so mixed with some almonds would be good
yes<00:05:19.750> okay<00:05:20.520> that's<00:05:21.990> that's<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.169> very<00:05:23.410> good
