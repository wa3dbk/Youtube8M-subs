00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it back to them because it is you know

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.099 
it back to them because it is you know
their<00:00:29.580> property<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.539> mean<00:00:30.689> what's<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> use

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
their property and I mean what's the use

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.250 
their property and I mean what's the use
of<00:00:31.349> keeping<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.710> everything's<00:00:32.099> program<00:00:32.520> um

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
of keeping it everything's program um

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.420 
of keeping it everything's program um
you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.590> their<00:00:34.710> network<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.280> their

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
you know for their network or their

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.520 
you know for their network or their
system<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.140> useless<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
system so it's going to be useless to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.250 
system so it's going to be useless to
you<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.629> pay<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> return

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you and they do pay for a return

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.690 
you and they do pay for a return
shipping<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> mean<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.219> pointless<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
shipping so I mean it's pointless to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.600 
shipping so I mean it's pointless to
keep<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.030> inside<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.100> whole<00:00:44.399> bunch<00:00:44.489> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
gonna get the AC adapter now you're

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.570 
gonna get the AC adapter now you're
gonna<00:01:12.000> plug<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:14.310> base<00:01:15.860> which<00:01:16.860> also<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
base connects to your Ethernet so you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
base connects to your Ethernet so you
don't<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> always<00:01:20.280> plug<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> unplug<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
uglier so I'm glad they sent me a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
uglier so I'm glad they sent me a
compact<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.899> looks<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.470> know

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
compact one because it looks you know

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.179 
compact one because it looks you know
it's<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:51.140> guess<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.500> too<00:01:52.560> big<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it's not as I guess it's not too big and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.469 
it's not as I guess it's not too big and
it<00:01:53.399> looks<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.700> it'll<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.000> easy<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.450> use

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it looks like it'll be easy to use

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.569 
it looks like it'll be easy to use
because<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> buttons<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.619> spaced<00:01:55.860> pretty

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
because the buttons are spaced pretty

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.810 
because the buttons are spaced pretty
good<00:01:57.979> there's<00:01:58.979> no<00:01:59.130> why<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> made<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.490> videos

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
good there's no why I made this videos

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.310 
good there's no why I made this videos
because<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.299> looking<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.899> soon<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.200> was

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
because I was looking as soon as I was

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.649 
because I was looking as soon as I was
accepted<00:02:01.799> into<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> national<00:02:02.759> panel<00:02:03.119> or

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
accepted into the national panel or

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
accepted into the national panel or
consumer<00:02:04.110> panel<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.530> looking<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.950> an

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
consumer panel I was looking for an

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.730 
consumer panel I was looking for an
unboxing<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.740> because

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
unboxing or what I would get because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.630 
unboxing or what I would get because
they<00:02:07.950> fail<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:10.250> disclose<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
they fail to disclose that on the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.059 
they fail to disclose that on the
website<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.989> didn't<00:02:13.200> see<00:02:13.290> any<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.560> YouTube

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
website and I didn't see any on YouTube

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.020 
website and I didn't see any on YouTube
so<00:02:14.159> I<00:02:14.189> thought<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.519> would<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.819> great

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so I thought this would be a great

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.259 
so I thought this would be a great
opportunity<00:02:15.749> to<00:02:15.989> make<00:02:16.409> one<00:02:17.030> that's<00:02:18.030> pretty

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
opportunity to make one that's pretty

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.420 
opportunity to make one that's pretty
much<00:02:18.389> it<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.780> did<00:02:19.019> scan<00:02:19.349> my<00:02:19.590> first<00:02:19.829> item<00:02:19.980> some

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
much it I did scan my first item some

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.690 
much it I did scan my first item some
mangos<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.939> got<00:02:21.150> from<00:02:21.389> Costco<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.019> six<00:02:22.319> dollars

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
mangos I got from Costco for six dollars

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
mangos I got from Costco for six dollars
and<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.849> seemed<00:02:24.030> pretty<00:02:24.060> simple

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
and it seemed pretty simple

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.559 
and it seemed pretty simple
I<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:26.040> wish<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.519> keyboard<00:02:26.939> was<00:02:27.090> kind<00:02:27.389> of<00:02:27.450> like
