is actually stuck in the off mode you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.260 
is actually stuck in the off mode you
can<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:50.219> yet<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.700> actually<00:00:51.149> just

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
can or there yet it's actually just

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.689 
can or there yet it's actually just
frozen<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> screen<00:00:52.440> let's<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
frozen on a screen let's do that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.299 
frozen on a screen let's do that
scenario<00:00:54.090> first<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.719> frozen<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.020> screen

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
scenario first if it's frozen on screen

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.350 
scenario first if it's frozen on screen
and<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> power<00:00:56.579> button<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:56.940> helping

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and the power button is not helping

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.580 
and the power button is not helping
tapping<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> screen<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.230> doing<00:00:58.440> anything

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
tapping the screen is not doing anything

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.369 
tapping the screen is not doing anything
simply<00:00:59.460> hold<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> volume<00:01:00.359> down<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.320> power

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
simply hold the volume down and power

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.460 
simply hold the volume down and power
buttons<00:01:02.309> at<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.520> same<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.470> keep

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
buttons at the same time and keep

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469 
buttons at the same time and keep
holding<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.040> until<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> feel<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.299> phone

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
holding them until you feel the phone

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.410 
holding them until you feel the phone
vibrate<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.549> let<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
vibrate then you can let go now that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
vibrate then you can let go now that
should<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.930> basically<00:01:10.290> reboot<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.159> device

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
should just basically reboot the device

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.690 
should just basically reboot the device
if<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.850> ever<00:01:12.000> stuck<00:01:12.680> if<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.369> stuck

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
if it's ever stuck if it's really stuck

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.690 
if it's ever stuck if it's really stuck
and<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.960> working<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.520> actually

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and that's not working you can actually

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.740 
and that's not working you can actually
hold<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.420> volume<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.680> power<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.750> camera

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
hold down volume down power and camera

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
hold down volume down power and camera
all<00:01:21.960> at<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> same<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:24.200> then<00:01:25.200> once<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.310> phone

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
all at the same time then once the phone

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
all at the same time then once the phone
vibrates<00:01:27.090> let<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> power<00:01:28.259> button<00:01:28.380> but

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
vibrates let go of the power button but

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
vibrates let go of the power button but
keep<00:01:28.950> holding<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> volume<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> camera

keep holding the volume down and camera

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
keep holding the volume down and camera
button<00:01:30.930> until<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.770> believe<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.460> will<00:01:32.549> vibrate

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
button until I believe it will vibrate

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.880 
button until I believe it will vibrate
again<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.350> let<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> everything

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
again then you can let go of everything

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.609 
again then you can let go of everything
that<00:01:35.430> will<00:01:36.030> erase<00:01:36.750> everything<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> device

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that will erase everything on the device

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.039 
that will erase everything on the device
though<00:01:37.909> but<00:01:38.909> that's<00:01:39.150> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> last<00:01:39.780> resort

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
though but that's kind of a last resort

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.410 
though but that's kind of a last resort
if<00:01:40.229> things<00:01:40.470> are<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.009> working<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:42.210> keep

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
if things are just not working do keep

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
if things are just not working do keep
in<00:01:42.540> mind<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> backup<00:01:44.189> with

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
in mind that you do have a backup with

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.560 
in mind that you do have a backup with
this<00:01:44.640> device<00:01:44.880> whether<00:01:45.090> you've<00:01:45.299> synced<00:01:45.540> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
this device whether you've synced with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.109 
this device whether you've synced with
Google<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.380> set<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.770> SkyDrive<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
Google or if you set up your SkyDrive to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.789 
Google or if you set up your SkyDrive to
automatically<00:01:48.840> backup<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.229> contacts<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
automatically backup your contacts and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.440 
automatically backup your contacts and
photos<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.369> stuff<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.610> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
photos and all that stuff so you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.249 
photos and all that stuff so you
shouldn't<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.750> too<00:01:51.960> worried<00:01:52.229> about<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.880> but

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
shouldn't be too worried about it but

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.289 
shouldn't be too worried about it but
that's<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that's how you can do it if there is a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
that's how you can do it if there is a
serious<00:01:57.719> issue<00:01:57.860> if<00:01:58.860> after<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
serious issue if after all that the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.770 
serious issue if after all that the
phone<00:01:59.880> still<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.590> booting<00:02:01.920> up

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
phone still is not really booting up

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.539 
phone still is not really booting up
there<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.140> last<00:02:04.350> resort<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.040> Nokia<00:02:05.369> has
