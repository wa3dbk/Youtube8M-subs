 well the first sample from the water of the moon lake busy nothing 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.980
 unusual and her little water glass interesting something simple 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.159
 says I had also tested Edina Rott now when I see 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.409
 the Irish will be the two again 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.409
 this is possible for the us exchanges 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.930
 nothing happened 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 it could not say yet 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 Munich 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 completely to succumbing 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 to 7 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.900
 that's definitely more space 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.780
 Quest career 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.160
 Websense 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.010
 it's a little back door 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.160
 I do not know 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.670
 that has not shaped me and possibly is in the idle traffic in this 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.800
 Healthy area 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.010
 what I do not 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.600
 but now that we can know what to do about it 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.730
 knew something 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.800
 I feel a bit better similar 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.990
 that's nice 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.990
 we are pretty good team after their synthesis 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 No 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.420
 that is naive 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.450
 because unlike the moves from the Cloud Player is the profit of the sideline 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.770
 I should be missing 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.219
 that looks like it 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.589
 but that in turn are not all interested in 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.919
 you can not do that 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.459
 so that should 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.260
 Circle class of the Euro has been heard after seeing 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.069
 vin / ap 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.390
 many small minorities in the wm story we are on ours 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.390
 think about strengthening 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.759
 I learned a lot 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.759
 I could not have delivered at all 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.709
 his insured

 kl 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.739
