00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.390
 name is tom toms and welcome back 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.070
 to a new edition of yahoo id 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.410
 cheers hidrive in the background you see 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.750
 already a sports car from Germany 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.510
 from stuttgart namely the porsche cayman 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.039
 my subscriber dominik determined 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.079
 thought man the whole import racer 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.510
 now muscle cars have to be here too 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.969
 again German sports cars show that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.500
 he here on the jubi id test track the 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.900
 Mr. in the ring is whether they succeed 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 we'll see how 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.310
 used to look at the technical 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.230
 page like the cayman r still currently 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.300
 to buy at the dealer is info 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.620
 Located in the category rear-wheel drive 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.790
 mid-engine is celebrating at the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.270
 acceleration and start 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.049
 really good the performance data 246 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.670
 kw 370 newton meters the whole on 1.372 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.250
 kilogram so a real lightweight 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.719
 the little colleague here the end I am 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.460
 Of course, everything is not enough 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.460
 but let God drive on rear-wheel drive 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.810
 thanks to certificates he 80 states 85 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.530
 So he did a good job there 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.670
 performance data 246 kw 370 newton meters 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.969
 and 1152 kilo so just slimmed the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.289
 performance has stayed the same 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:34.279
 acceleration values ​​500 3.6 seconds 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.659
 top speed 267 km / h like 

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:38.299
 I also have a few 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.649
 technical data picked out and still 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.389
 a few infos in barracks view the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.399
 series that we see here from porsche 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:46.219
 cayman r or general of porsche 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.130
 cayman was built from 2005 to 2013 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.920
 the porsche cayman r arrived at the 2010 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.859
 market as the basis for the r version offers 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.979
 the cayman s but in comparison to him 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.719
 the cayman r has 10 ps like 55 kilo 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.999
 less and with a new chassis 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.889
 is also the entire car 20 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.950
 millimeter lower top speed 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:09.560
 of the car 282 km / h compared to 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.630
 Dominik 267 so stupid his is one 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.849
 a little slower from zero to one hundred 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.950
 5.0 seconds with the six-speed 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.780
 he's manual clearly dominik 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.790
 how fast can you get a light weight 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.670
 car even lighter makes you determined 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.520
 also asked and you have the doors and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.600
 The front hood is made of aluminum 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.080
 After that they thought human like that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.760
 to run 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.560
 throw something out 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.980
 Damming only weighs and you hear the car 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.870
 not so 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.160
 then you have in the interior please continue 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.900
 There is no door 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.560
 You do not need storage cupboards 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.240
 away with it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 There is also if you want to close the door 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.320
 do not want to make a grip but 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.110
 simply a textile loop too 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.370
 known from the porsche gt3 rs lies 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.990
 everything a little less too good 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.750
 Lastly, there is no air conditioning and 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.540
 There is also no radio and the driver 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.190
 puts his butt on sports bucket seats 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.290
 but it will be time for us to do that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.200
 dare pass our tooth racer 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.250
 some say his helmet is in summer 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.140
 air-conditioned 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.540
 but you only know them under the name 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.820
 Tom stick and he has it in here 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.590
 past the roll cage and he sees 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.300
 also here at the rear a giant 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.490
 fritten counter hintendrauf which the venture 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.490
 open back to give you contact pressure 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.080
 he easier slip here at the start of the 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.490
 everything is not a problem is also normal 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.550
 always runs the rear tires are likely 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.230
 have had maximum width 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.510
 and now we come slowly 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.970
 in the first turn this is wilson the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.440
 first endurance test of the landing gear and also 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.060
 when braking because of the attack points 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.890
 but in the middle of the curve is we see 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.240
 the stick he can stay really nice 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.190
 is also immediately on the grass again 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.040
 on it and the tail remains stable as 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.420
 used outdoor camera with 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.100
 cockpit perspective mixed now goes 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.320
 he purely in chicago 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.750
 Let's see how once on grass 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.100
 yes no problems no black 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.680
 but that's right 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.570
 really fast from the higher you also 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.930
 again a six-cylinder boxer engine located 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.360
 Beautifully screwed up to brakes rhine 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.820
 changes in hammerhead left and right 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.080
 sometimes can soon stay 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.910
 make a couple of strokes and 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.060
 here comes the already previously to clear 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.070
 cold tires completely normal but there is 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.320
 still mix by the time looks 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.150
 So far quite good from now 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.610
 it's full throttle 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.850
 slightly lashed because full throttle against the 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.190
 unfortunately not here 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.840
 the tire piles over or they are fine 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.880
 so that she can look good now 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.860
 dare show that he is on the straight too 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.140
 one of the fastest heard 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.630
 slow down to the penultimate turn 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.060
 look at how narrow and narrow 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.340
 inside the greatest stay here can stay 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.500
 purely in gemen still a small line 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.970
 drawn and that in berlin about that 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500
 good again, so I'm real 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.280
 curious what time here at comes out 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.040
 a minute best of 1 minute 17 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.420
 was thereby placed the lotus in 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.390
 the a class for the sake of the best will not 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.420
 just a minute 20 o clock a pity 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.110
 be faster than we actually were 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.990
 too bad so I'm really surprised 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.260
 total time 1 minute 20 28 8 and so 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.660
 currently ranked third in the category yes 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.690
 where was the car so missing 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.490
 easy was not easy enough or 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.100
 maybe it was missing a bit 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.590
 performance so somehow the dare was 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.540
 fast but he recommends under the dash 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.250
 maybe a little bit pepper 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.440
 Now to conclude another survey 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.560
 the total table of the a category 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.530
 we see the lotus of fat at the top 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.870
 nitro followed by james by name 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.040
 products kia cee'd kia is faster than 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.870
 a porsche you have to first 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.180
 to get it to third place 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.710
 followed by kos the there reges and basti 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.320
 currently has with his honda civic the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.630
 Red lantern at the academies of the hand 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.140
 well I think from watching to the 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.140
 See you next time
