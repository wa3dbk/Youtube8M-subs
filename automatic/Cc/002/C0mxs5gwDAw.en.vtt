00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.149
 the forecast is that another tutorial on the www site with three lectures for the 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.269
 public 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.509
 but we'll learn how to play the decisive and fun geologist 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.599
 obina sport 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.929
 exiled ministers we have some information 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.709
 with the controls that are sure to be set up at school 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 now it's surrounded by there 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.190
 and the keys fd is to join 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.540
 that serve 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 houses in maneuvers while you're in the air 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.160
 so to start the game 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 click here on earth how much it 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 have to swim all we have 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.550
 the score does not have sources to bet on the music can start the game 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.820
 which means turning back the time to normalize the same score as the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.850
 what to do now are two of Shiite homes the time between others 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.530
 has it all up 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.050
 for accelerated power is the most 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.630
 the distracting shoe 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.840
 his rag 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 forlÃ¡n as the teams and now 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.950
 but you pay attention I'm not seeing any point when they do not 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.760
 novelty of being that I do a side and how you now also something else 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.620
 What you can do 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.160
 while you're in the air 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.000
 if it can take until now how you gave them what I did not do any 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.770
 Another interesting thing is that you can climb but these metal bars 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.500
 you earn a lot more points if you can do it but it is not one of the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.100
 More things we have to do in the game. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 if you hit against 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.340
 automatically change direction as soon as you fall 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.030
 however, some Pakistani 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.559
 with some pain 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.049
 the maneuvers he makes 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.919
 then in this case 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.039
 the kama chinen complete the maneuver 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.779
 which means that she was often still 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.659
 the transfer 16 years 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.739
 the legs to make maneuvers 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.309
 because you can only 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.629
 to change 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.419
 he says that they are common in this country can not be used enough by 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.749
 the lobby 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:46.239
 do this in my project answers 50 points or even press a key 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.759
 and complete the note 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.859
 and also is more interesting problem sites if you do not have support 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:01.539
 enough or did something wrong just end up falling time it's over 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.539
 punctuation but we put your name 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.129
 and I was going to play again by the typhoon 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.599
 honestly 3 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.269
