Abomasnow<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.020> Rotom<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.980> think<00:00:08.220> he<00:00:08.309> had<00:00:08.429> two

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
Abomasnow and Rotom I think he had two

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.860 
Abomasnow and Rotom I think he had two
other<00:00:08.940> things<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.450> were<00:00:09.540> kind<00:00:09.719> of

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
other things that were kind of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.850 
other things that were kind of
threatening<00:00:10.759> again<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:13.349> used<00:00:13.590> six

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
threatening again this is a you used six

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.680 
threatening again this is a you used six
Pokemon<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.910> choose<00:00:15.179> four<00:00:15.570> of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
Pokemon but you have to choose four of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.970 
Pokemon but you have to choose four of
those<00:00:15.809> Pokemon<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.470> get<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> see<00:00:16.859> your

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
those Pokemon and you get to see your

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.310 
those Pokemon and you get to see your
opponent's<00:00:17.400> team<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:18.810> he<00:00:19.080> might<00:00:19.230> have

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
opponent's team so I think he might have

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
opponent's team so I think he might have
had<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> Metagross<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.340> something<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
had like a Metagross or something I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.689 
had like a Metagross or something I
don't<00:00:21.689> remember<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.859> decided<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.400> go

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
don't remember but I decided to just go

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.580 
don't remember but I decided to just go
ahead<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.119> lead<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.390> my<00:00:24.660> standard<00:00:25.199> lead<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
ahead and lead with my standard lead of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.769 
ahead and lead with my standard lead of
hitmontop<00:00:25.949> Togekiss<00:00:26.849> he<00:00:27.420> leads<00:00:27.689> with

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
hitmontop Togekiss he leads with

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.040 
hitmontop Togekiss he leads with
Infernape<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.560> latias<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.480> go<00:00:30.869> for

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
Infernape and latias now I just go for

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.590 
Infernape and latias now I just go for
the<00:00:31.109> intimidate<00:00:31.619> quite<00:00:32.040> obviously<00:00:32.579> uh<00:00:32.610> not

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the intimidate quite obviously uh not

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.420 
the intimidate quite obviously uh not
exactly<00:00:33.750> sure<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> expect<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> these

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
two but I have a feeling that infer

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
two but I have a feeling that infer
names<00:00:36.960> gonna<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.649> something<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.730> goes<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.030> the

names gonna do something it goes for the
fake<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> couldn't<00:00:40.020> remember<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.410> fake

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
fake out and I couldn't remember a fake

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.220 
fake out and I couldn't remember a fake
out<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.010> follow<00:00:41.160> me<00:00:41.430> had<00:00:41.640> higher<00:00:41.879> priority<00:00:42.629> but

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
out or follow me had higher priority but

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.600 
out or follow me had higher priority but
in<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.410> case<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.800> works<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.129> great<00:00:44.430> that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
in this case it works out great that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.060 
in this case it works out great that
follow<00:00:45.390> me<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.809> lower<00:00:46.110> priority<00:00:46.739> than<00:00:46.770> fake

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070

this thing with Infernape and I want to
get<00:02:15.870> hitmontop<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.620> anyway<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.670> will<00:02:17.790> also

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
get hitmontop out anyway this will also

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940

give me a second intimidate against

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.740 
give me a second intimidate against
Infernape<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.760> shouldn't<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.480> much

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
Infernape so it shouldn't do that much

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.630 
Infernape so it shouldn't do that much
damage<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:22.290> either<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.650> its<00:02:22.709> attacks<00:02:25.640> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
damage with either of its attacks it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.670 
damage with either of its attacks it
goes<00:02:26.849> for<00:02:27.090> close<00:02:27.330> combat<00:02:27.780> which<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.379> kind<00:02:28.620> of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
goes for close combat which is kind of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.020 
goes for close combat which is kind of
interesting<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:31.519> yeah<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.640> does<00:02:32.819> some<00:02:33.000> good

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
interesting and yeah it does some good

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.119 
interesting and yeah it does some good
damage<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.560> enough<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.950> really

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
damage but not really enough to really

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.600 
damage but not really enough to really
worry<00:02:35.430> about<00:02:36.410> lot<00:02:37.410> C<00:02:37.620> house<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.950> still<00:02:38.280> frozen

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
worry about lot C house is still frozen

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.789 
worry about lot C house is still frozen
solid<00:02:39.030> which<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:40.049> fine<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.349> go<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.739> the

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
solid which is just fine I go for the

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.770 
solid which is just fine I go for the
Thunder<00:02:41.160> punch<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.549> Infernape<00:02:41.940> which<00:02:42.209> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
Thunder punch on Infernape which you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.119 
Thunder punch on Infernape which you
know<00:02:42.900> should<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.230> enough<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.739> take<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.010> out

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
know should be enough to take it out

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.100 
know should be enough to take it out
particularly<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.180> defense<00:02:45.329> lowering

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
particularly with that defense lowering

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.449 
particularly with that defense lowering
although<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.349> think<00:02:46.590> even<00:02:46.769> without<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.310> it

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
although I think even without it it

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.670 
although I think even without it it
would<00:02:47.579> have<00:02:47.610> done<00:02:47.760> enough<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.480> decided<00:02:49.410> not<00:02:49.620> to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
would have done enough I decided not to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.240 
would have done enough I decided not to
hit<00:02:50.010> latias<00:02:50.400> right<00:02:50.819> now<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.470> little<00:02:53.129> bit

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
hit latias right now so a little bit

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.770 
hit latias right now so a little bit
more<00:02:53.430> hail<00:02:53.670> damage<00:02:54.180> I've<00:02:55.079> taken<00:02:55.319> out<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:57.510> his

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
still frozen solid which is very

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.870 
still frozen solid which is very
unfortunate<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.840> him<00:03:09.989> i<00:03:10.319> slashed<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.489> Rotom

unfortunate for him i slashed the Rotom

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.390 
unfortunate for him i slashed the Rotom
with<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.060> cross<00:03:12.359> chop<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.440> get<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> critical<00:03:14.160> hit

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
with a cross chop and get a critical hit

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.289 
with a cross chop and get a critical hit
off<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.569> don't<00:03:16.049> know<00:03:16.139> I<00:03:16.170> mean<00:03:16.500> I

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
off of it I really I don't know I mean I

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.460 
off of it I really I don't know I mean I
didn't<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.359> if<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.569> should<00:03:18.599> hit<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> lot<00:03:19.049> es<00:03:19.290> or

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
didn't know if I should hit a lot es or

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.199 
didn't know if I should hit a lot es or
not<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.919> I<00:03:19.950> wanted<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.340> get<00:03:20.459> Rotom<00:03:20.880> out<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.150> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
not but I wanted to get Rotom out of the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.680 
not but I wanted to get Rotom out of the
way<00:03:21.329> first<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.739> he's<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.040> shadow<00:03:23.489> ball<00:03:23.790> doesn't

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
way first so he's a shadow ball doesn't

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.990 
way first so he's a shadow ball doesn't
do<00:03:25.019> quite<00:03:25.319> enough<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.889> knock<00:03:26.069> out<00:03:26.310> my

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
do quite enough to knock out my

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300 
do quite enough to knock out my
hitmontop<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.109> hit<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.319> with<00:03:28.590> close<00:03:28.919> combat

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
hitmontop and I hit it with close combat

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.210 
hitmontop and I hit it with close combat
now<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.239> think<00:03:30.450> between<00:03:30.959> cross<00:03:31.590> trap<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.069> close

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
now I think between cross trap and close

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.860 
now I think between cross trap and close
combat<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.819> would<00:03:32.940> have<00:03:33.030> taken<00:03:33.299> out<00:03:33.419> Rotom

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
combat it would have taken out Rotom

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.900 
combat it would have taken out Rotom
regardless<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.069> critical<00:03:35.430> hit<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:35.669> cross

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
regardless of the critical hit on cross

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.059 
regardless of the critical hit on cross

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
chop but whatever it's all good so yeah

however Lodi ass is still frozen so it

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.619 
however Lodi ass is still frozen so it
doesn't<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.370> anything<00:04:05.609> pretty<00:04:06.359> much<00:04:06.480> the

doesn't do anything pretty much the

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.780 
doesn't do anything pretty much the
whole<00:04:06.750> turn<00:04:07.019> gets<00:04:07.260> wasted<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.609> take<00:04:08.760> a
