leap<00:01:01.780> from<00:01:02.079> this<00:01:02.260> little<00:01:02.500> bit<00:01:02.739> guy<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.950> this

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
leap from this little bit guy to this

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.430 
leap from this little bit guy to this
big<00:01:03.430> guy<00:01:03.610> well<00:01:04.149> even<00:01:04.390> though<00:01:04.660> that<00:01:04.899> guy<00:01:05.050> seems

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.620 
big guy well even though that guy seems
little<00:01:05.860> he's<00:01:06.070> still<00:01:06.310> pretty<00:01:06.520> powerful<00:01:06.970> so

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
little he's still pretty powerful so

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.450 
little he's still pretty powerful so
don't<00:01:08.440> underestimate<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:09.310> ghost<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.220> what

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
don't underestimate the ghost so what

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.190 
don't underestimate the ghost so what
what<00:01:12.729> features<00:01:13.180> does<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.630> big<00:01:13.840> new<00:01:14.020> one

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
what features does this big new one

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200 
what features does this big new one
bring<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.440> bear<00:01:14.740> really<00:01:15.490> it's<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.759> ability

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
bring the bear really it's the ability

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.840 
bring the bear really it's the ability
to<00:01:16.390> mount<00:01:16.569> a<00:01:16.899> whole<00:01:17.440> variety<00:01:17.679> of<00:01:18.009> cameras<00:01:18.640> on

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850

really provide something that they could

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.029 
really provide something that they could
use<00:01:30.670> so<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.509> this<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:32.349> available<00:01:32.590> yet<00:01:32.950> are

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
it'll it'll move you forward well what

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.559 
it'll it'll move you forward well what
what<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:43.959> cause<00:01:44.259> it<00:01:44.649> does<00:01:45.190> cause<00:01:45.429> it's<00:01:45.700> 5000

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
what is it cause it does cause it's 5000

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.660 
what is it cause it does cause it's 5000
and<00:01:46.899> so<00:01:47.289> what's<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.679> potential<00:01:47.979> payload<00:01:48.520> in

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
and so what's the potential payload in

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.949 
and so what's the potential payload in
terms<00:01:48.819> of<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:49.030> professional<00:01:49.330> Cinema<00:01:49.810> Camera

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
terms of a professional Cinema Camera

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.230 
terms of a professional Cinema Camera
weight-wise<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:51.099> pretty<00:01:51.310> amazing<00:01:51.550> it<00:01:51.940> holds

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
weight-wise it's pretty amazing it holds

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.690 
weight-wise it's pretty amazing it holds
up<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.509> 12<00:01:52.720> pounds<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:54.099> think<00:01:54.369> it's<00:01:54.550> maybe

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
up to 12 pounds so I think it's maybe

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.100 
up to 12 pounds so I think it's maybe
even<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:55.030> little<00:01:55.060> over<00:01:55.539> 12<00:01:55.810> but<00:01:56.789> plenty<00:01:57.789> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
even a little over 12 but plenty of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.449 
even a little over 12 but plenty of
