00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.049
 while about fifty machines 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.050
 have already been ordered to the company 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.090
 artec the latest addition to the range rs 20 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 made his first rounds in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.969
 public presence at the end of the month of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.730
 last may 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 long awaited the sprayer rs 20 is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 predestined for low spraying 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.570
 volume and at high speed this is a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 machine so that exist in two wheels 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.039
 but also with an option in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.210
 four wheel drive suspension to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.719
 four independent wheels 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.630
 in the front we are on a suspension 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 mechanical type with a spring and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.520
 two tubes that slide one in 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.980
 the other so back suspension always 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.050
 as independent on the assault both 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 wheels with so there a suspension 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.420
 pneumatic with lungs so with 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.449
 of air and a leveling valve of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 way to keep the same height as 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.039
 the machine is loaded or empty and the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.020
 same suspension travels is 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 also the same suspension flexibility 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 with a voice is adjustable 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 hydraulically at the front as at 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.640
 the back 2 1 m 80 up to 2 meters in 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.299
 10 the rs 20 is driven by an engine 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.860
 deutz 255 horses to move 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.930
 the motor motor is equipped with a 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.700
 hydrostatic transmission with a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 hydraulic motor in every wheel that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.689
 drives a geared motor the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.729
 builder justifies his choice by a 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.729
 cutting gain and responsiveness 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.620
 no 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.829
 looting and looting ramps 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.780
 is engine idling and therefore 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.520
 always at the same speed 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.369
 we can, however, if we wish 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 adjust the speed of unfolding and 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.570
 retreat age way to make them go more 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.289
 or less quickly so regarding the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.840
 spray 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:12.340
 we are on a regulation so two 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.170
 types who throw with debbie born and 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.560
 pressure sensors one can choose from 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.160
 work with one or the other and 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.700
 on a traffic that is a little bit 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.069
 particular called a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.720
 traffic back when one does not 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.000
 not spray that we put the pump to 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.819
 road is powered by this central trio 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.530
 here so the liquid starts on each side 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.549
 to the row and back through the pipes 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.040
 we have here 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.569
 from the moment we are going to put the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.510
 spraying on the way ie 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.760
 the goals will start to sink nono 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.609
 back here we sell their turn go 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.019
 let's sip ourselves reverse and we will feed 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.420
 in three points ie 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.130
 feeds the ramp at the center and at each 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.810
 end and so the product instead of 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.579
 to circulate in this direction will circulate in 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.560
 the other way to go to feed the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.109
 ramp the traffic around is 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.670
 embellished with stop boutaher hills or 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.560
 only under the influence of pressure 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.510
 so as not to let escape 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.790
 of products in case of malfunction 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.299
 or leaks on the air circuit in 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.920
 cabin 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.359
 we find all the necessary 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.250
 control of the machine and the 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.780
 spraying to a first screen is 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.000
 dedicated to servoing the machine 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.709
 a second brings together the elements of 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.480
 gps control of the guide bar 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.549
 and automatic sections cuts 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.840
 the last screen of access to the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.019
 payroll management 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.019
 a sion 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.190
 in order to work in the best 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.740
 conditions at high speed stability 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.080
 of the machine is paramount 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.110
 design been thought for loads 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.500
 fixed engine and cabins were passed 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.050
 in the sense of q2 2008 at the back and the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.330
 other oil and tank fuel fluids 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.670
 rinsing in the front under the hood of 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.770
 this way the rs 20 offers a 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.050
 load distribution of 40% on 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.670
 the front axle and that 60% on the axle 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.130
 back when the main tank is 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.620
 full and the ramp unfold in position 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:11.290
 work for the vertical suspension of 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.820
 makes it a cylinder of variable geometry 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.950
 coupled with a ball the zot on the 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.170
 elements right and left offers the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.400
 flexibility to avoid any movement 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.650
 back and forth 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.630
 the folding cylinders of the ramp to 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.400
 double chance are equipped with a system 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.400
 anti friction hydrocution 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.350
 we
