 Then when I call, will you be with him? 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:08.520
 here today hÃ©lio tuf aquino gelli tuschi 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.439
 you will have several settings here 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.540
 will have this list here 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.489
 will have this list here that has all the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.420
 d apps 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.250
 then you will choose a sind then 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.959
 this option first option you will 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.680
 always activate which is proactive in 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.680
 settings 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.719
 the second one is a lot for what it is 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.469
 more moves a bit with no graph 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:42.909
 integrates and takes not has to which is where 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:45.290
 that does not pick up there nail picks the csa 4 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:52.419
 I think the real one then picks up with 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:55.909
 a none of itself with sms is the handle 16 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.019
 this one oscillated and I decided then he 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.840
 will decrease 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.769
 here it will decrease the screen it will stay 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.040
 smaller 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.409
 then when internal play will increase more 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.299
 with the resolution of the smaller screen 25 to 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:13.639
 decrease and even more the screen goes 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:19.040
 increase they are to decrease to what 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:21.409
 was 16 bit and optimize is to help 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.699
 play to improve some 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:28.970
 things in the game have game that work 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:33.560
 This is the professional with which you 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.629
 you are configuring is a program from the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.060
 type a 3d fountain you can 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.260
 set up how they wanted you to go 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.049
 find it better 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.479
 This game is going to spin fast. 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:49.129
 served is slow running with a 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:51.620
 good quality to be you who configure 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.939
 the way you want it here 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:01.430
 compression also tinkers with the 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:05.780
 textures is disabling the game sometimes 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.930
 was on the fast track enabling the turn of 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.979
 work slower you can 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.840
 be testing there to see what the 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:18.169
 configuration that the game will send 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.469
 better here will decrease the texture that 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:25.100
 this important option that will also 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.710
 decrease 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.390
 a little texture letters two some 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.700
 lyrics will not give you to understand what 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.500
 It is written but the game will run a 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.690
 little better 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.950
 or will this make the game open one day 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.470
 government opens and 0.25 decreases the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.090
 that I admire is much more 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.190
 so you configure yourself the way you 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.200
 You did less the way you 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:54.380
 work if use eff gas account is the number 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.450
 of ips and the game is running 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.120
 that's why you should not use it because 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:06.380
 can go can and hamper performance 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.140
 the game is also here that I do not know okay 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.040
 people who do not make the slightest idea what 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.490
 is largest ever tried a move I do not 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.170
 I understood why this is this is the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.930
 place where was play will stay 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.530
 associative so here you almost 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.100
 in a right corner with the left underneath 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.580
 here also one of the conferences 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.730

 r b rs adreno in mali you can choose e 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.750
 intense in the games reinforcing to the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.600
 it works 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.870
 there it has to work with a certain 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.140
 gpu 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.180
 then for you this is a program 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.810
 pulling for you to configure the 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:14.630
