00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.250 

after<00:02:20.010> you're<00:02:20.129> done<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:21.110> then<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
after you're done with that then you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.140 
after you're done with that then you
take<00:02:22.530> your<00:02:22.610> piston<00:02:23.610> brush<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:25.010> with<00:02:26.010> the
