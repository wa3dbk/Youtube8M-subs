kind of lay it next to it and then wrap
it<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.519> one<00:02:12.000> more<00:02:12.060> time<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.100> have

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.690 
it down one more time so that you have
three<00:02:15.450> pieces<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.170> ribbon<00:02:16.350> laying<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.489> top

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.940 

and<00:02:23.609> then<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.230> hold<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.769> our

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and then we're going to hold it with our

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
and then we're going to hold it with our
thumb<00:02:25.980> we're<00:02:26.519> going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.730> tuck<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.269> this<00:02:27.930> bottom

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
thumb we're going to tuck in this bottom

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.100 
thumb we're going to tuck in this bottom
piece<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.459> like<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.940> tuck<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.599> piece

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
piece I just like to tuck in that piece

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.900 
piece I just like to tuck in that piece
because<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.530> going<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.800> be<00:02:31.890> hidden<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.400> then

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
because it's going to be hidden and then

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.230 
because it's going to be hidden and then
this<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.269> going<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.510> be<00:02:33.629> your<00:02:33.810> tail

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
this is going to be your tail

middle<00:02:36.690> squeeze<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.840> together<00:02:38.190> now<00:02:39.190> we're

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
middle squeeze it together now we're

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.060 
middle squeeze it together now we're
going<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.580> flip<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.090> over<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.960> you<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:42.040> see

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
going to flip it over and you can see

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.980 
going to flip it over and you can see
now<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.730> side<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.210> just<00:02:43.420> have<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.780> two

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
now on this side you just have the two

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.350 
now on this side you just have the two
showing<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:44.950> can<00:02:45.760> kind<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.060> hide<00:02:46.180> that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
showing and you can kind of hide that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.750 
showing and you can kind of hide that
piece<00:02:46.630> if<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:46.960> want<00:02:47.110> but<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.340> don't<00:02:48.490> need<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
piece if you want but you don't need to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.230 
piece if you want but you don't need to
and<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:50.470> are<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.890> going<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.370> accordion

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
and now we are just going to accordion

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.170 
and now we are just going to accordion
fold<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.020> we're<00:02:53.170> going<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.380> fold<00:02:53.760> pinch<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.000> and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
fold so we're going to fold pinch it and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.040 
fold so we're going to fold pinch it and
fold<00:02:55.930> down<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:57.390> fold<00:02:58.390> down<00:02:59.430> just<00:03:00.430> like<00:03:00.580> that

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
fold down and fold down just like that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.340 
fold down and fold down just like that
so<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.170> kind<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.440> looks<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.710> our<00:03:03.010> tuxedo<00:03:04.350> bow

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
so it kind of looks like our tuxedo bow

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.320 
so it kind of looks like our tuxedo bow
but<00:03:06.040> then<00:03:06.220> we're<00:03:06.400> going<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:07.350> spread<00:03:08.350> out<00:03:08.410> those

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
but then we're going to spread out those

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.760 
but then we're going to spread out those
loops<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.750> then<00:03:10.900> you're<00:03:11.080> just<00:03:11.110> wrapping<00:03:11.620> your

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
loops so then you're just wrapping your

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.010 
loops so then you're just wrapping your
wire<00:03:11.980> around<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.670> center<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.750> don't<00:03:13.900> do

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
wire around the center if you don't do

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.900 
wire around the center if you don't do
it<00:03:14.050> too<00:03:14.290> tight<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.710> can<00:03:14.890> still<00:03:15.130> adjust<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.790> you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
it too tight you can still adjust if you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.910 
it too tight you can still adjust if you
need<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.270> if<00:03:16.540> it's<00:03:16.720> not<00:03:17.020> quite<00:03:17.200> in<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.440> center

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
need to if it's not quite in the center

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.390 
need to if it's not quite in the center
once<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.180> looks<00:03:19.450> good

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
once you it looks good

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.950 
once you it looks good
and<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.610> look<00:03:21.760> like<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.120> think<00:03:22.330> both<00:03:22.690> sides

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
and you look like you think both sides

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.410 
and you look like you think both sides
are<00:03:23.170> even<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:24.490> want<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.850> little<00:03:25.030> farther

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.310 
that I cut my ribbon with to cut my wire
just<00:03:57.850> because<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.330> wire<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.930> know<00:03:59.050> really

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
just because the wire is you know really

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.860 
just because the wire is you know really
hard<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.710> your<00:03:59.860> scissors<00:04:00.220> then<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.420> like<00:04:01.690> to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
hard on your scissors then I like to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.380 
hard on your scissors then I like to
flatten<00:04:02.290> my<00:04:02.440> Center<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.970> squeeze<00:04:04.360> that

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
flatten my Center just squeeze that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.170 
flatten my Center just squeeze that
together<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.560> now<00:04:06.070> your<00:04:06.280> wire<00:04:06.460> is<00:04:06.700> nice<00:04:06.940> and

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
together and now your wire is nice and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.860 
together and now your wire is nice and
tight<00:04:08.130> then<00:04:09.130> you're<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.460> going<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.850> open<00:04:10.750> her

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
tight then you're just going to open her

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.480 
tight then you're just going to open her
loops<00:04:11.110> like<00:04:11.320> this<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.470> now<00:04:14.470> with<00:04:15.160> like

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
loops like this like that now with like

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.030 
loops like this like that now with like
this<00:04:15.730> white<00:04:16.000> one<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.510> left<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.530> little<00:04:17.710> bit<00:04:17.920> of

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
this white one I left a little bit of

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.349 
this white one I left a little bit of
the<00:04:18.160> tail<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.549> I<00:04:18.580> could<00:04:18.790> have<00:04:18.910> left<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.210> little

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
the tail and I could have left a little

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.690 
the tail and I could have left a little
bit<00:04:19.570> longer<00:04:19.780> if<00:04:20.020> I<00:04:20.140> wanted<00:04:20.500> since<00:04:21.220> our<00:04:21.370> ribbon

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
bit longer if I wanted since our ribbon

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.950 
bit longer if I wanted since our ribbon
is<00:04:21.850> printed<00:04:22.710> I'm<00:04:23.710> going<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.070> go<00:04:24.190> ahead<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.960> cut

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
is printed I'm going to go ahead and cut

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.030 
is printed I'm going to go ahead and cut
this<00:04:26.200> one<00:04:26.410> all<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.010> way<00:04:27.130> down<00:04:27.960> because<00:04:29.040> we

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
this one all the way down because we

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.500 
this one all the way down because we
don't<00:04:30.220> really<00:04:30.310> want<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.670> see<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:30.880> white<00:04:31.240> part

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
don't really want to see that white part

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.880 
don't really want to see that white part
and<00:04:31.630> then<00:04:31.810> I'm<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.050> going<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.440> heat<00:04:32.620> seal

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
and then I'm just going to heat seal

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.730 
and then I'm just going to heat seal
that<00:04:33.100> end<00:04:35.370> my<00:04:36.370> lighter<00:04:36.640> or<00:04:37.480> ends<00:04:38.200> don't<00:04:38.410> fray

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
that end my lighter or ends don't fray

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.610 
that end my lighter or ends don't fray
and<00:04:39.460> now<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.000> can<00:04:40.270> see<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:41.110> end<00:04:41.380> is

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
and now you can see that that end is

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.189 
and now you can see that that end is
nice<00:04:42.280> and

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
nice and

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.159 
nice and
hidden<00:04:43.469> and<00:04:43.710> then<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.699> one<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.419> already

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
hidden and then this one is already

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.019 
hidden and then this one is already
going<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:46.800> hidden<00:04:47.009> up<00:04:47.310> under<00:04:47.669> there<00:04:47.819> but

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:48.029 
going to be hidden up under there but

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.330 
going to be hidden up under there but
we're<00:04:48.180> going<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.389> pull<00:04:48.599> it<00:04:48.629> out<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.349> we're

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
we're going to pull it out and we're

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.899 
we're going to pull it out and we're
going<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.669> heat<00:04:51.090> seal<00:04:51.569> those<00:04:51.870> ends<00:04:52.409> and<00:04:55.909> then

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
going to heat seal those ends and then

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.290 
going to heat seal those ends and then
we're<00:04:57.090> going<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.360> stick<00:04:58.229> it<00:04:58.259> back<00:04:58.499> up<00:04:58.710> in<00:04:58.889> and

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
we're going to stick it back up in and

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.360 
we're going to stick it back up in and
that's<00:05:00.300> why<00:05:00.539> in<00:05:00.749> that<00:05:00.779> one<00:05:01.499> step<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:01.919> said<00:05:02.159> to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
that's why in that one step I said to

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.820 
that's why in that one step I said to
pull<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.849> in<00:05:02.999> a<00:05:03.150> little<00:05:03.389> because<00:05:03.719> we<00:05:04.650> don't

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
pull it in a little because we don't

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.510 
pull it in a little because we don't
really<00:05:04.979> want<00:05:05.129> to<00:05:05.370> see<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.759> piece<00:05:09.680> okay<00:05:10.680> so
