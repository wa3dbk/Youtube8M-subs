00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
you want just by connecting a second

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.919 
you want just by connecting a second
controller<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.759> it<00:01:37.270> really<00:01:37.479> makes<00:01:37.810> a

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
controller and it really makes a

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.719 
controller and it really makes a
difference<00:01:37.960> when<00:01:38.679> you're<00:01:38.889> playing<00:01:39.249> with<00:01:39.429> two

difference when you're playing with two
it's<00:01:40.569> a<00:01:40.840> bit<00:01:41.109> easier<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.679> take<00:01:41.979> down<00:01:42.189> the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
it's a bit easier to take down the

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.830 
it's a bit easier to take down the
bosses<00:01:42.729> since<00:01:42.969> there's<00:01:43.240> double<00:01:43.749> the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
bosses since there's double the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.379 
bosses since there's double the
firepower<00:01:44.319> why<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.039> never<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.700> an<00:01:45.939> easy<00:01:46.090> game

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
firepower why it never is an easy game
