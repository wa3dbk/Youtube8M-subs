this<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.100> quite<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> nice<00:00:05.490> area<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.089> standing

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
this is quite a nice area of standing

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.259 
this is quite a nice area of standing
water<00:00:06.779> where<00:00:07.170> we<00:00:07.379> can<00:00:07.620> look<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:08.269> collecting

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
water where we can look at collecting

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.410 
water where we can look at collecting
some<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.080> purifying<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:10.920> drinking<00:00:14.360> so<00:00:15.360> it

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
some and purifying it for drinking so it

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.750 
some and purifying it for drinking so it
would<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.630> ideal<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.379> everybody's<00:00:17.369> woodland

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
would be ideal in everybody's woodland

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400 
would be ideal in everybody's woodland
to<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> lovely<00:00:18.480> fresh<00:00:18.810> Mountain<00:00:19.199> Brook

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to have a lovely fresh Mountain Brook

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.650 
to have a lovely fresh Mountain Brook
running<00:00:19.800> through<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> reality<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
running through it but the reality is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.000 
running through it but the reality is
there's<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.080> many<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.410> those<00:00:22.500> woodlands

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
there's not many of those woodlands

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.700 
there's not many of those woodlands
around<00:00:23.279> most<00:00:23.640> people<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.060> stuck<00:00:24.240> with

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
around most people are stuck with

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.929 
around most people are stuck with
stagnant<00:00:25.710> collections<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> water<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.730> time

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
stagnant collections of water this time

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
stagnant collections of water this time
of<00:00:27.090> year<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:29.130> you're<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.429> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
of year like we have here if you're in a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
of year like we have here if you're in a
survival<00:00:29.820> situation<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.599> rule<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.929> thumb<00:00:31.109> is

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
survival situation the rule of thumb is

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.010 
survival situation the rule of thumb is
if<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.399> water<00:00:32.610> supply<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.840> is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
if this is your water supply this is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.340 
if this is your water supply this is
what<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.260> drink<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.579> make<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.000> ill<00:00:36.350> but

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
what you drink it will make you ill but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.049 
what you drink it will make you ill but
the<00:00:37.469> rule<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.890> put<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.460> than<00:00:38.820> comes

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the rule is you put more in than comes

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.959 
the rule is you put more in than comes
out<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.710> survive<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.940> I

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
out and if you do that you survive now I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
out and if you do that you survive now I
can<00:00:42.149> guarantee<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.809> wherever<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
can guarantee you wherever you go in the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.170 
can guarantee you wherever you go in the
world<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.129> dig<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> hole<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.820> will

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
world if you dig a hole you will

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.959 
world if you dig a hole you will
eventually<00:00:45.629> find<00:00:45.809> water<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:47.129> hole<00:00:47.399> might<00:00:47.730> be

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
eventually find water that hole might be

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.360 
eventually find water that hole might be
two<00:00:48.270> miles<00:00:48.510> deep<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.590> therefore<00:00:49.800> you'd<00:00:50.070> spend

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
two miles deep so therefore you'd spend

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
two miles deep so therefore you'd spend
an<00:00:50.520> awful<00:00:50.760> lot<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> time<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.539> energy<00:00:51.629> digging

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
an awful lot of time and energy digging

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.670 
an awful lot of time and energy digging
it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.760 
it
but<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> knew<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.210> certain<00:00:54.600> plants<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
but if you knew or certain plants you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.650 
but if you knew or certain plants you
can<00:00:55.949> find<00:00:56.190> indications<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> where<00:00:57.120> water<00:00:57.360> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
can find indications of where water is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.810 
can find indications of where water is
closest<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> surface<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
closest to the surface and one of the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
closest to the surface and one of the
best<00:01:00.000> plants<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.510> finding<00:01:00.899> water<00:01:01.079> close<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
best plants for finding water close to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.359 
best plants for finding water close to
the<00:01:02.190> surface<00:01:02.570> is<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.780> plant<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the surface is this plant here so this

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
the surface is this plant here so this
is<00:01:05.549> soft<00:01:05.820> rush<00:01:06.150> got<00:01:06.600> no<00:01:06.869> edible<00:01:07.260> properties

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
is soft rush got no edible properties

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.000 
is soft rush got no edible properties
whatsoever<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> beauty<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:10.010> if

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
whatsoever but the beauty of it is if

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.719 
whatsoever but the beauty of it is if
you<00:01:11.159> split<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> open<00:01:12.200> contends<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> white

you split it open contends like a white

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.070 
you split it open contends like a white
spongy<00:01:14.729> material<00:01:17.299> now<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.930> as

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
spongy material now this you can use as

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.380 
spongy material now this you can use as
a<00:01:19.110> filter<00:01:19.380> straw<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> water<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:21.090> suck<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
a filter straw in the water you suck the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
a filter straw in the water you suck the
water<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:22.110> through<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.799> any<00:01:23.340> small

that's fine for personal use but if

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
your mouth for them to drink so you've

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.650

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
got to come up with other methods of

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.520 
got to come up with other methods of
purifying<00:03:06.660> water<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.390> one<00:03:09.600> method<00:03:10.290> works

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
purifying water and one method works

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.350 
purifying water and one method works
really<00:03:10.770> really<00:03:10.890> well<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.530> boil<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.920> water

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
really really well is to boil the water

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.120 
really really well is to boil the water
but<00:03:15.360> even<00:03:15.630> if<00:03:15.750> you're<00:03:15.900> boiling<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.830> water

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
but even if you're boiling this water

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.330 
but even if you're boiling this water
here<00:03:19.070> it's<00:03:20.070> still<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.610> contain<00:03:20.940> lots<00:03:21.209> of

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
here it's still going to contain lots of

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.979 
here it's still going to contain lots of
particles<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.580> mud<00:03:24.090> residue<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:24.810> that

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
particles and mud residue and all that

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.350 
particles and mud residue and all that
sort<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.320> stuff<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.680> it

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
sort of stuff in it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.940 
sort of stuff in it
so<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.480> head<00:03:27.630> back<00:03:27.780> over<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.350> fire

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
so we head back over to the fire

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.460 
so we head back over to the fire
lighting<00:03:29.280> area<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:30.780> put<00:03:30.930> our<00:03:31.050> conteiner

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
lighting area so we put our conteiner

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.550 
lighting area so we put our conteiner
onto<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.280> fire<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.989> steel<00:03:34.260> plate<00:03:34.530> to

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
onto a fire this is on a steel plate to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.979 
onto a fire this is on a steel plate to
protect<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.100> bottom<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.519> tin<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
protect the bottom of the tin and the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.180 
protect the bottom of the tin and the
whole<00:03:37.140> idea<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.650> we're<00:03:37.800> going<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.010> heat

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
whole idea is that we're going to heat

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.040 
whole idea is that we're going to heat
the<00:03:38.340> water<00:03:38.519> up<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.940> here<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.450> create<00:03:39.750> steam

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
the water up in here to create steam

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.290 
the water up in here to create steam
which<00:03:40.830> will<00:03:41.010> then<00:03:41.190> discharge<00:03:41.730> itself<00:03:42.120> through

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
which will then discharge itself through

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.910 
which will then discharge itself through
this<00:03:42.480> pipe<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.930> as<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.170> travels<00:03:43.470> further<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
this pipe and as it travels further and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.500 
this pipe and as it travels further and
further<00:03:44.010> along<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.459> pipe<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:45.480> should

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
further along the pipe it should

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.430 
further along the pipe it should
condense<00:03:46.230> into<00:03:46.620> water<00:03:47.810> then<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.989> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
condense into water then the the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.900 
condense into water then the the
aforesaid<00:03:49.769> mentioned<00:03:50.310> drinks<00:03:50.579> bottle<00:03:50.850> that

you<00:03:51.000> find<00:03:51.269> wherever<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:52.890> goes<00:03:53.070> into<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.579> end

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
you find wherever it goes into the end

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.500 
you find wherever it goes into the end
of<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.910> pipe<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> quite<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> long

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
of the pipe and it's a quite a long

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.020 
of the pipe and it's a quite a long
small<00:03:58.049> process<00:03:58.590> that's<00:03:59.549> quite<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> nice
