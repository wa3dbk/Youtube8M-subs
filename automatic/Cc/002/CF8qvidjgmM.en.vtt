00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 you mentioned earlier is one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.179
 pregnant now no complete 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.309
 would recommend switching to raw food 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:16.199
 how else can one say the flat rate 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 whether a complete switch to raw food 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.650
 from one day to another or one 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.460
 Slow getting used to being a student is for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 if for the swing no it is not for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.960
 pregnant people but have for 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.309
 an average person I say 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.899
 now if I switch now 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.790
 would be missing 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.430
 that the day of one of the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.469
 So other makes I did it 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.660
 that was no problem for me and many 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.789
 other people have done that and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.700
 it was not a real problem for her 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.140
 I do not think that's the problem 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.239
 change from one day to the next 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.730
 A problem for the body is the power 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.739
 that can easily even sick 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 People even have the seriously ill 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 People did a lot more and much more 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.470
 more important is that you are mentally 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.790
 it should be prepared 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.390
 be a decision and if I am 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.950
 I decide to do stand ups 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.110
 some people do not have physical 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.909
 a problem with the transition but you 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.030
 also country problem with the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.340
 mental area to be able to bow if 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.090
 Of course, I switch to the raw food 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.030
 and i always focus on the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.950
 loss on what i have nothing to do with the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.979
 always play with both eyes on the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.219
 cooked food I supposedly now 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.630
 No more problems then 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.289
 give was then I come in one 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.439
 lack of condition when i get my focus though 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.109
 Focus on what I get now 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.899
 new possibilities a new one 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.060
 nutrition a lighter diet i 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.899
 I need less and I do mine 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.329
 Focus on what I have new now 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.739
 what I have more then I have 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.959
 no problem 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.159
 and just in the office cost back to the 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.219
 look at books 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.609
 We have vegetables and raw food from 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.040
 pour vegetables know many people 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.670
 have quite normal conventionally 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.879
 feed 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.670
 we know not have the vegetables since 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.250
 we already have a profit 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.079
 who can already crop up in the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.450
 conventional kitchen will take 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.430
 sunflowers fought to become who 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.620
 takes sprouts in the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.569
 conventional nutrition and so on 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.790
 that is quite a lot of novelty the one 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.130
 enrichment represents when I am 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.769
 focus on how fast I am 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.230
 have a meal on the table 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.419
 I then wash the work of pater 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.169
 cook everything and everything else 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:53.530
 done had it going very quickly 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:57.730
 These are the real advantages you get 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.910
 his focus should be as I said 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.299
 there are new thinks there is a new one 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.299
 awareness 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.700
 the only thing stopping you 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.540
 could just switch to the raw food 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 or hesitant to go to this raw food 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:21.290
 is if you respect or up to fear 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.190
 before that has to meet itself 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.190
 this could be in the country
