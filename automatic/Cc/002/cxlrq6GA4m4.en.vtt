smooth surface to work on taking your

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.650 
smooth surface to work on taking your
sin<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.399> you're<00:00:47.550> gonna<00:00:47.670> begin<00:00:48.000> by<00:00:48.059> tracing<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
sin so you're gonna begin by tracing the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
sin so you're gonna begin by tracing the
outline<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.320> design<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:50.129> addition<00:00:50.550> let's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
outline of your design if addition let's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.160 
outline of your design if addition let's
be<00:00:50.789> quite<00:00:51.030> heavy-handed<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:51.989> pencil

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
be quite heavy-handed with your pencil

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.139 
be quite heavy-handed with your pencil
and<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.500> does<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.430> time<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.000> be

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and it does take a bit of time to be

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.080 
and it does take a bit of time to be
patient<00:00:55.070> once<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.219> done<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.550> flip

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
patient once you're done with that flip

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.990 
patient once you're done with that flip
this<00:00:57.239> design<00:00:57.510> over<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.680> place<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.129> making

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this design over and place it in making

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
this design over and place it in making
sure<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.270> lines<00:01:00.420> before<00:01:01.320> tracing<00:01:01.800> over<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
sure that lines before tracing over the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.470 
sure that lines before tracing over the
design<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.370> again<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.940> time<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
design and again but this time on the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.670 
design and again but this time on the
back<00:01:05.150> again<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> take<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> time

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
back again this is take a bit of time

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
back again this is take a bit of time
but<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> said<00:01:08.430> before<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.090> be

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but like I said before it just be

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.320 
but like I said before it just be
patient<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.810> you'll<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:11.150> once<00:01:12.150> you're

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
patient and you'll get once you're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.490 
patient and you'll get once you're
finished<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> should<00:01:13.439> look

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
finished this is what it should look

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.039 
finished this is what it should look
like<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.090> also<00:01:15.210> go<00:01:15.450> back<00:01:15.479> over<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
like and you can also go back over the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
like and you can also go back over the
stencil<00:01:16.229> lines<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> pencil<00:01:17.220> again<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
stencil lines when you pencil again and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.830 
stencil lines when you pencil again and
make<00:01:17.850> sure<00:01:17.880> don't<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.270> too<00:01:18.509> heavy-handed

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
make sure don't go too heavy-handed

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.240 
make sure don't go too heavy-handed
because<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> would<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.680> harder<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> erase

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
because it would be harder to erase

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.800 
because it would be harder to erase
afterwards<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.540> you've<00:01:24.630> done<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
afterwards now that you've done that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.660 
afterwards now that you've done that
even<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> exact<00:01:25.860> same<00:01:26.070> thing<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
even is the exact same thing on the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
even is the exact same thing on the
bottom<00:01:26.850> flipping<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> stencil<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.080> it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
bottom flipping the stencil so it's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.080 
bottom flipping the stencil so it's
facing<00:01:28.380> downwards<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> tracing<00:01:29.729> over<00:01:30.000> at

facing downwards and tracing over at

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.130 
facing downwards and tracing over at
once<00:01:30.299> again<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> Sun<00:01:33.659> stencil

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
once again and with the Sun stencil

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
once again and with the Sun stencil
you're<00:01:34.380> gonna<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> exact<00:01:35.460> same<00:01:35.490> thing

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you're gonna do the exact same thing

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
you're gonna do the exact same thing
this<00:01:36.540> time<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> middle<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
this time put it in the middle and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.080 
this time put it in the middle and
tracing<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.400> over<00:01:38.700> once<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:40.759> after<00:01:41.759> that

craft<00:01:50.700> glue<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:53.310> step<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.700> makes<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
craft glue this step just makes it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760 
craft glue this step just makes it
easier<00:01:54.329> instead<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> having<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> report<00:01:55.409> again

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
easier instead of having to report again

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.109 
easier instead of having to report again
and<00:01:55.950> again<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.549> go<00:01:56.759> straight<00:01:57.000> from

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and again you can just go straight from

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
and again you can just go straight from
the<00:01:57.270> cup<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.020> canvas<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:58.829> back

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the cup to the canvas and then back

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
the cup to the canvas and then back
again<00:02:01.430> taking<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.520> flat<00:02:02.790> edge<00:02:02.969> brush<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
again taking a flat edge brush like the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.330 
again taking a flat edge brush like the
one<00:02:03.780> I'm<00:02:03.869> showing<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.380> you're<00:02:04.890> gonna<00:02:05.040> dip<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
one I'm showing here you're gonna dip it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.889 
one I'm showing here you're gonna dip it
carefully<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> glue<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.600> start

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
carefully in the glue and then start

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.809 
carefully in the glue and then start
filling<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.409> stencil<00:02:07.950> making<00:02:08.580> sure<00:02:08.729> you

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
filling in the stencil making sure you

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.580 
filling in the stencil making sure you
go<00:02:08.940> over<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.450> pencil<00:02:09.810> lines<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.349> rid<00:02:10.530> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
go over the pencil lines to get rid of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.940 
go over the pencil lines to get rid of
them

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.500 

I<00:02:12.980> found<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.370> doing<00:02:13.610> small<00:02:13.910> sections<00:02:14.360> at<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
I found that doing small sections at a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.360 
I found that doing small sections at a
time<00:02:14.540> work<00:02:14.959> best<00:02:15.260> because<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.770> glue<00:02:15.980> dried

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
time work best because the glue dried

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.790 
time work best because the glue dried
quite<00:02:16.819> fast<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.110> did<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.319> small<00:02:18.590> bit<00:02:18.769> of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
quite fast so if I did a small bit of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.440 
quite fast so if I did a small bit of
this<00:02:19.010> stencil<00:02:19.220> as<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.760> covering<00:02:20.269> glitter

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
this stencil as I was covering glitter

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.400 
this stencil as I was covering glitter
and<00:02:20.720> then<00:02:20.810> move<00:02:21.050> on<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.349> next<00:02:21.530> part<00:02:23.140> now<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
and then move on to the next part now I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.380 
and then move on to the next part now I
used<00:02:24.739> about<00:02:24.890> 20<00:02:25.370> different<00:02:25.700> brushes<00:02:26.060> when<00:02:26.360> I

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
used about 20 different brushes when I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.270 
used about 20 different brushes when I
was<00:02:26.540> doing<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.810> craft<00:02:27.110> tutorial<00:02:27.560> but<00:02:28.040> if<00:02:28.129> you

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
was doing this craft tutorial but if you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.009 
was doing this craft tutorial but if you
don't<00:02:28.459> have<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.819> many<00:02:29.090> brushes<00:02:29.390> then<00:02:29.750> don't

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
don't have that many brushes then don't

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.290 
don't have that many brushes then don't
fret<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.680> just<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.610> messy<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:32.000> who's<00:02:32.180> in

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
fret I just get a bit messy one who's in

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.020 
fret I just get a bit messy one who's in
distress<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:32.690> yeah<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.519> another<00:02:37.760> spare

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
distress so yeah this is another spare

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.280 
distress so yeah this is another spare
piece<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.360> paper<00:02:38.540> comes<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.930> handy<00:02:39.140> because

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
piece of paper comes in handy because

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.199 
piece of paper comes in handy because
you<00:02:39.530> can<00:02:39.620> tap<00:02:39.920> off<00:02:40.099> any<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.849> excess

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
you can tap off any of the excess

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.509 
you can tap off any of the excess
glitter<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.500> also<00:02:42.709> took<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.069> dry<00:02:43.280> brush

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
glitter and I also took a dry brush

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.520 
glitter and I also took a dry brush
afterwards<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.180> went<00:02:44.390> over<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.140> reveal

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
afterwards I went over just to reveal

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.570 
afterwards I went over just to reveal
the<00:02:45.709> pattern<00:02:45.920> even<00:02:46.400> more<00:02:48.040> now<00:02:49.040> I'll<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.190> keep

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
the pattern even more now I'll just keep

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.130 
the pattern even more now I'll just keep
doing<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.000> step<00:02:50.299> over<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.810> over<00:02:51.049> again

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
doing that step over and over again

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:54.970 
doing that step over and over again
until<00:02:51.530> you've<00:02:51.890> covered<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.370> Thomas

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.710 

all<00:03:55.980> right<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.430> can<00:03:56.760> stop<00:03:57.150> there<00:03:57.540> because

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
all right so you can stop there because

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.720 
all right so you can stop there because
the<00:03:57.960> next<00:03:58.260> steps<00:03:58.440> aren't<00:03:58.680> exactly<00:03:59.040> mandatory

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
the next steps aren't exactly mandatory

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.400 
the next steps aren't exactly mandatory
but<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.000> just<00:04:00.240> gives<00:04:00.480> your<00:04:00.630> canvas<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:01.050> better

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
but it just gives your canvas a better

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.800 
but it just gives your canvas a better
kind<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.920> finish<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.510> makes<00:04:03.540> it

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
kind of finish to it and it makes it

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.970 
kind of finish to it and it makes it
look<00:04:03.840> nice<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.140> when<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.440> hang<00:04:04.620> out<00:04:04.770> on<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
look nice and when you hang out on the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.570 
look nice and when you hang out on the
wall<00:04:06.830> taking<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> hairdryer<00:04:08.280> out<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.490> the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
wall taking a hairdryer out on the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.520 
wall taking a hairdryer out on the
coldest<00:04:09.060> something<00:04:09.450> possible<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.080> went<00:04:10.320> over

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
coldest something possible I went over

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.900 
coldest something possible I went over
the<00:04:10.620> canvas<00:04:11.010> just<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.340> get<00:04:11.460> rid<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.700> any

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
the canvas just to get rid of any

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.360 
the canvas just to get rid of any
stubborn<00:04:12.390> bits<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.870> glitter<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.890> also<00:04:14.070> used

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
stubborn bits of glitter and I also used

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.620 
stubborn bits of glitter and I also used
a<00:04:14.430> paintbrush<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.180> help<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.510> along<00:04:15.570> I

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
a paintbrush just to help it along I

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.420 
a paintbrush just to help it along I
also<00:04:18.630> suggest<00:04:19.109> using<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.500> sealant<00:04:19.980> for<00:04:20.100> this

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
also suggest using a sealant for this

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.340 
also suggest using a sealant for this
because<00:04:20.670> blister<00:04:21.180> has<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.359> tendency<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.049> fall

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
because blister has a tendency to fall

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.950 
because blister has a tendency to fall
off<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.770> cameras<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.850> can<00:04:24.270> use<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.480> kind<00:04:24.870> of

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
off the cameras so you can use a kind of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.530 
off the cameras so you can use a kind of
blue<00:04:25.290> Ceylon<00:04:25.800> or<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.010> hairspray<00:04:26.550> works<00:04:26.880> just<00:04:27.360> as

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
blue Ceylon or a hairspray works just as

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.990 
blue Ceylon or a hairspray works just as
well

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
well

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.580 
well
taking<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> leftover<00:04:30.540> glue<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.750> had<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.200> added<00:04:31.500> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
taking the leftover glue I had I added a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.380 
taking the leftover glue I had I added a
small<00:04:31.740> bit<00:04:32.070> of<00:04:32.100> water<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:33.060> poured

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
small bit of water to it and then poured

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.480 
small bit of water to it and then poured
that<00:04:33.690> mixture<00:04:34.169> into<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.650> spray<00:04:34.950> bottle<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.460> found

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
that mixture into a spray bottle I found
