a couple days ago generally I'll put
fiber<00:02:00.160> mesh<00:02:00.399> tape<00:02:00.580> over<00:02:00.789> large<00:02:01.149> cracks<00:02:01.539> I

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
fiber mesh tape over large cracks I

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.380 
fiber mesh tape over large cracks I
scored<00:02:02.680> this<00:02:02.860> with<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.070> razor<00:02:03.369> knife<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.700> these

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
scored this with a razor knife and these

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.469 
scored this with a razor knife and these
two<00:02:04.780> buildings<00:02:05.049> don't<00:02:05.439> touch<00:02:05.860> there<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:07.030> gap

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
two buildings don't touch there is a gap

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.499 
two buildings don't touch there is a gap
here<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> quarter<00:02:08.229> inch<00:02:08.440> inside<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.310> what<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.209> did

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
here a quarter inch inside I what I did

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.660 
here a quarter inch inside I what I did
was<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:11.049> put<00:02:11.410> some<00:02:11.860> caulking<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.400> here<00:02:12.640> a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
was I put some caulking in here a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.509 
was I put some caulking in here a
polyurethane<00:02:13.269> ii<00:02:14.049> flex<00:02:14.260> i<00:02:14.620> put<00:02:15.100> fire<00:02:15.280> mesh

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
polyurethane ii flex i put fire mesh

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.370 
polyurethane ii flex i put fire mesh
tape<00:02:15.760> then<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.120> put<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.510> bonding<00:02:16.959> agent<00:02:17.049> over

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
tape then we put the bonding agent over

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.590 
tape then we put the bonding agent over
that<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.640> stop<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.000> water<00:02:19.239> from<00:02:19.390> going

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
that just to stop the water from going

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.569 
that just to stop the water from going
between<00:02:19.900> these<00:02:20.260> two<00:02:20.530> certain<00:02:21.040> things<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.370> can

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
between these two certain things you can

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.610 
between these two certain things you can
and<00:02:21.820> can't<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.780> can't<00:02:22.870> guarantee<00:02:23.320> it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and can't do this I can't guarantee it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.280 
and can't do this I can't guarantee it
won't<00:02:23.769> hairline<00:02:24.610> crack<00:02:24.940> again<00:02:25.120> because<00:02:25.510> two

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
won't hairline crack again because two

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.440 
won't hairline crack again because two
buildings<00:02:26.799> aren't<00:02:27.420> connected<00:02:29.610> properly<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
buildings aren't connected properly and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.360 
buildings aren't connected properly and
that's<00:02:31.720> generally<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.250> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
that's generally what you do is you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.069 
that's generally what you do is you
break<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.730> stucco<00:02:34.120> out<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.390> put<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.570> stud<00:02:34.900> here

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
break the stucco out you put a stud here

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.229 
break the stucco out you put a stud here
your<00:02:35.260> lag<00:02:35.440> bolts<00:02:35.680> together<00:02:36.010> put<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:36.910> all<00:02:37.090> back

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
your lag bolts together put it all back

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.320 
your lag bolts together put it all back
together<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.870> with

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
together this with

wall this wall you can get a 1600 psi
electric<00:03:38.930> pressure<00:03:39.800> washer<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.580> recommend<00:03:41.180> it

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
electric pressure washer I recommend it

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.430 
electric pressure washer I recommend it
24<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:42.050> guy<00:03:42.260> got<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.640> 3100<00:03:43.870> psi<00:03:44.870> means<00:03:45.260> it's

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
24 this guy got a 3100 psi means it's

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.400 
24 this guy got a 3100 psi means it's
pretty<00:03:45.650> strong<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.430> he<00:03:46.520> removed<00:03:46.820> a<00:03:47.090> lot<00:03:47.300> of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
pretty strong and he removed a lot of

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.720 
pretty strong and he removed a lot of
peeling<00:03:48.410> paint<00:03:48.590> now<00:03:48.890> we<00:03:49.400> don't<00:03:49.520> know<00:03:49.640> if

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
peeling paint now we don't know if

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.430 
peeling paint now we don't know if
there's<00:03:49.910> LED<00:03:50.180> in<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.690> stuff<00:03:50.840> like<00:03:51.050> that<00:03:51.260> so

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
there's LED in it and stuff like that so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.640 
there's LED in it and stuff like that so
therefore<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.860> can't<00:03:52.190> really<00:03:52.370> do<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:54.230> pressure

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
therefore I can't really do the pressure

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.729 
therefore I can't really do the pressure
washer<00:03:54.920> because<00:03:55.280> for<00:03:55.880> 200<00:03:56.300> bucks<00:03:56.620> there's<00:03:57.620> a

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739
