00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
got Fabregas as well since you're

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.720 
got Fabregas as well since you're
attacking<00:00:33.600> mid<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.739> too<00:00:35.160> sure<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
attacking mid I'm not too sure about the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.700 
attacking mid I'm not too sure about the
time<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.300> mean<00:00:37.200> when<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.530> video<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.920> taken

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
time I mean when this video was taken

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.950 
time I mean when this video was taken
the<00:00:40.710> reason<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:41.040> saying<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.460> because

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
the reason I'm saying this is because

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.150 
the reason I'm saying this is because
Fabregas<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.230> price<00:00:43.559> could<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.920> dropped

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
Fabregas this price could have dropped

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740 
Fabregas this price could have dropped
by<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:45.000> he's<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.329> worth<00:00:45.539> much

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
by then because now he's not worth much

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.979 
by then because now he's not worth much
