00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
today we're talking about the breathing

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.410 
today we're talking about the breathing
that<00:00:18.080> we<00:00:18.200> should<00:00:18.439> do<00:00:18.740> for<00:00:19.189> using<00:00:19.670> our<00:00:19.820> lungs<00:00:20.180> in

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
that we should do for using our lungs in

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.400 
that we should do for using our lungs in
the<00:00:20.450> most<00:00:20.900> efficient<00:00:21.530> way<00:00:21.640> before<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.789> dive
