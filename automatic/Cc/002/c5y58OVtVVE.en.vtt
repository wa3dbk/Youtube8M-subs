another extra life finished act 2 not as
fast<00:04:35.770> that's<00:04:36.070> still<00:04:36.400> pretty<00:04:36.490> good<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.030> we're

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
fast that's still pretty good and we're

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.159 
fast that's still pretty good and we're
off<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.810> second<00:04:38.290> special<00:04:38.680> stage<00:04:40.169> getting

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
off to the second special stage getting

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
the Chaos Emeralds as early in the game

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.290 
the Chaos Emeralds as early in the game
as<00:04:43.389> possible<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.169> really<00:04:44.620> great<00:04:44.740> idea

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
as possible is a really great idea

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.969 
as possible is a really great idea
because<00:04:46.300> as<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:47.080> get<00:04:47.290> further<00:04:47.470> along<00:04:47.680> the

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
because as you get further along the

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.300 
because as you get further along the
game<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.370> much<00:04:48.850> harder<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:50.110> make<00:04:50.979> sure<00:04:51.160> you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
game it's much harder to make sure you

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.590 
game it's much harder to make sure you
finish<00:04:51.550> an<00:04:52.120> act<00:04:52.479> with<00:04:52.990> over<00:04:53.440> 50<00:04:53.740> rings

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
finish an act with over 50 rings

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.930 
finish an act with over 50 rings
unfortunately<00:04:55.600> i<00:04:55.990> don't<00:04:56.800> really<00:04:57.220> handle<00:04:57.820> this

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
unfortunately i don't really handle this

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.719 
unfortunately i don't really handle this
one<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.539> well<00:04:58.810> i<00:04:59.110> decided<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.370> be<00:05:00.490> a<00:05:00.520> great

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
one that well i decided to be a great

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.690 
one that well i decided to be a great
idea<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.150> get<00:05:01.600> bounced<00:05:02.080> around<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.710> hop

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
idea to get bounced around and hop

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.820 
idea to get bounced around and hop
straight<00:05:04.060> into<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.419> goal<00:05:04.900> area<00:05:05.200> which<00:05:05.590> means

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
straight into the goal area which means

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.560 
straight into the goal area which means
that<00:05:05.950> while<00:05:06.250> i<00:05:06.280> did<00:05:06.700> finish<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.180> special

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
that while i did finish the special

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.890 
that while i did finish the special
stage<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:08.139> didn't<00:05:08.770> get<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.950> Chaos<00:05:09.130> Emerald

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
stage I didn't get the Chaos Emerald

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.440 
stage I didn't get the Chaos Emerald
most<00:05:10.900> unfortunate<00:05:11.410> is<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:12.090> now<00:05:13.090> here<00:05:13.330> we<00:05:13.419> are

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
most unfortunate is that now here we are

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.810 
most unfortunate is that now here we are
with<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:13.780> final<00:05:14.200> act<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.830> cannot<00:05:15.340> go<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.700> a

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
with the final act you cannot go to a

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.230 
with the final act you cannot go to a
special<00:05:16.240> zone<00:05:16.450> here<00:05:17.370> only<00:05:18.370> in<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.789> first<00:05:18.970> two

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
special zone here only in the first two

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.580 
special zone here only in the first two
acts<00:05:19.479> thankfully<00:05:20.289> there<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.470> an

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
acts thankfully there is an

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.840 
acts thankfully there is an
invincibility<00:05:20.979> power<00:05:21.310> up<00:05:21.490> right<00:05:21.700> at<00:05:21.789> the

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
invincibility power up right at the

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.219 
invincibility power up right at the
beginning<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.360> we<00:05:22.479> can<00:05:22.630> quickly<00:05:22.840> breeze

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
beginning so we can quickly breeze

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.050 
beginning so we can quickly breeze
through<00:05:23.500> some<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.830> stuff<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.669> grab<00:05:25.030> a

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
through some of the stuff and grab a

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.350 
through some of the stuff and grab a
shield<00:05:25.419> as<00:05:25.600> well<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.610> this<00:05:27.760> might<00:05:27.970> jump<00:05:28.150> up

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
shield as well and this might jump up

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.659 
shield as well and this might jump up
there<00:05:28.389> at<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.660> top<00:05:28.720> but<00:05:29.490> that's<00:05:30.490> alright

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
there at the top but that's alright

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.100 
there at the top but that's alright
because<00:05:30.880> there's<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.270> little<00:05:31.419> bouncy<00:05:31.930> room

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
because there's a little bouncy room

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.710 
because there's a little bouncy room
down<00:05:32.590> there

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
down there

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.190

is post commentary doing that for two

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.180 
is post commentary doing that for two
reasons<00:06:26.370> one<00:06:27.150> the<00:06:27.419> game<00:06:27.690> record<00:06:28.350> smoother<00:06:28.980> and

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
reasons one the game record smoother and

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.270 
reasons one the game record smoother and
runs<00:06:29.550> faster<00:06:30.290> if<00:06:31.290> I<00:06:31.410> use<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:31.860> built-in

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
runs faster if I use the built-in

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.270 
runs faster if I use the built-in
emulator<00:06:32.850> for<00:06:32.940> quarter<00:06:33.480> which<00:06:33.750> I<00:06:34.280> really

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
emulator for quarter which I really
