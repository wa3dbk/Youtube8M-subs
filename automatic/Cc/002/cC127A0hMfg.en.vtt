phantom of the opera I decided I didn't
like<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> stopped<00:00:23.300> there's<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.539> too

like it so I stopped there's just too
much<00:00:25.199> singing<00:00:25.939> even<00:00:26.939> though<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
much singing even though I know it as a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
much singing even though I know it as a
musical<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:31.579> yeah<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.420> me

musical thing but I yeah it's not for me

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.670 
musical thing but I yeah it's not for me
I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.649> because<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> Opera

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.710 

or<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.290> could<00:00:45.500> have<00:00:45.620> been<00:00:45.890> because<00:00:46.580> that<00:00:47.270> there

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
or it could have been because that there

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.670 
or it could have been because that there
was<00:00:47.930> barely<00:00:48.170> any<00:00:48.470> speaking<00:00:48.950> parts<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:51.050> just
