00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
opinion the best run on out there just

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.830 
opinion the best run on out there just
because<00:00:17.970> i<00:00:18.359> don't<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.850> how<00:00:20.850> venom<00:00:21.570> always

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
because i don't like how venom always

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.800 
because i don't like how venom always
has<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> exaggerated<00:00:22.830> tongue<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.490> mean

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
has the exaggerated tongue I mean

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.870 
has the exaggerated tongue I mean
sometimes<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.170> looks<00:00:25.260> good<00:00:25.619> other<00:00:26.189> times<00:00:26.580> it's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
sometimes it looks good other times it's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.839 
sometimes it looks good other times it's
just<00:00:26.970> way<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.500> exaggerate<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.789> too

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
just way they just exaggerate it way too

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.690 
just way they just exaggerate it way too
much<00:00:30.210> which<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.689> don't<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.160> this<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.430> just

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
much which I don't like this one just

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000 
much which I don't like this one just
simple<00:00:33.329> closed<00:00:33.660> mouth<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.559> think<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
simple closed mouth which I think it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.819 
simple closed mouth which I think it
looks<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.430> cool<00:00:37.850> I'm<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:38.930> very<00:00:39.930> glad

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
looks really cool I'm actually very glad

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.940 
looks really cool I'm actually very glad
they<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.610> saber-tooth<00:00:42.440> mold<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
they actually use saber-tooth mold so it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.160 
they actually use saber-tooth mold so it
is<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.280> reuse<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> saber-tooth<00:00:45.539> mold<00:00:48.170> cameras

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
is or reuse the saber-tooth mold cameras

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.549 
is or reuse the saber-tooth mold cameras
not<00:00:49.469> pickin<00:00:49.890> alright<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.840> probably

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
not pickin alright so this is probably

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
not pickin alright so this is probably
my<00:00:58.949> favorite<00:00:58.980> venom<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.640> already<00:00:59.879> said<00:01:00.120> that

my favorite venom I already said that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.390 
my favorite venom I already said that
but<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.320> definitely<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.500> paint<00:01:04.799> job<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
but it definitely is the paint job I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.969 
but it definitely is the paint job I
like<00:01:07.159> camera<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.840> the

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
like that ball joint and then he has

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.819 
like that ball joint and then he has
like<00:03:11.030> an<00:03:11.120> armpit<00:03:11.299> joint<00:03:12.220> right<00:03:13.220> there<00:03:14.410> up<00:03:15.410> down

two<00:03:20.780> points<00:03:21.609> the<00:03:22.609> wrist<00:03:22.930> moves<00:03:26.109> wrist

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
two points the wrist moves wrist

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.319

articulation<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.750> thumb<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.230> individually

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
articulation the thumb is individually

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.839 
articulation the thumb is individually
jointed<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:35.419> is<00:03:35.599> too<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.169> then<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
jointed and that is too and then the

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.140 
jointed and that is too and then the
finger<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:39.560> individually<00:03:40.519> joint<00:03:40.730> in<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.030> that

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
finger is individually joint in it that

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.670 
finger is individually joint in it that
was<00:03:41.239> my<00:03:41.359> dog<00:03:41.569> he<00:03:42.290> heard<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.560> um<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:44.989> was

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
was my dog he heard that um and that was

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.479 
was my dog he heard that um and that was
him<00:03:45.799> too<00:03:47.139> also<00:03:48.139> I<00:03:48.590> guess<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.040> same<00:03:49.220> would<00:03:49.370> be

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
him too also I guess the same would be

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.789 
him too also I guess the same would be
like<00:03:49.699> for<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> fist<00:03:50.329> type<00:03:51.169> hand<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.560> one

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
like for the fist type hand and this one

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.890 
like for the fist type hand and this one
is<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.720> guess<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.870> keep<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.139> open<00:03:57.199> but<00:03:58.069> uh<00:03:58.129> it's

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
is I guess to keep it open but uh it's

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.680 
is I guess to keep it open but uh it's
that<00:03:59.900> in<00:04:00.169> point<00:04:01.069> and<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.709> thumb<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.459> know<00:04:04.690> all

mean black and red and you can get it in
black<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.460> red<00:04:56.240> as<00:04:56.540> well<00:04:56.870> what<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.680> do<00:04:57.830> have

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
black and red as well what you do have

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.920 
black and red as well what you do have
that<00:04:58.040> but<00:04:58.790> that's<00:04:58.970> size<00:04:59.210> comparison<00:04:59.810> so

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
that but that's size comparison so

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.690 
that but that's size comparison so
that's<00:05:00.080> pretty<00:05:00.290> good<00:05:00.500> size<00:05:00.740> for<00:05:01.070> venom<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.610> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
that's pretty good size for venom in the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.000 
that's pretty good size for venom in the
spider-man<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.390> think<00:05:03.320> they<00:05:03.380> look<00:05:03.530> really<00:05:03.740> good

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
spider-man I think they look really good

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.680 
spider-man I think they look really good
together<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:07.090> not<00:05:08.090> like<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.450> though<00:05:08.660> I

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
together and that not like that though I

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.000 
together and that not like that though I
mean<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.110> think<00:05:09.350> they<00:05:09.740> really<00:05:11.530> come<00:05:12.530> down<00:05:12.560> sides

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
mean I think they really come down sides

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.250 
mean I think they really come down sides
like<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.190> so<00:05:13.610> that's<00:05:14.510> basically<00:05:14.690> i<00:05:14.990> do

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
like that so that's basically i do
