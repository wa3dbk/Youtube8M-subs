 the planet and the player did not put a single 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.580
 the cube of fuel on the engine then this

 fuel 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.599
 also on the solar system map there is 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.270
 hazardous areas that are highlighted especially 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.849
 asteroid belt and adjacent to the sun 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.490
 cells if the ship stops at 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:50.550
 one of these cells he loses one of and 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.470
 haul but if the ship stops at 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.110
 dangerous area not having to 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.270
 beyond the playing field or 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.580
 flies directly through the sun 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.729
 then he is in distress and must be 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.009
 immediately evacuated. evacuation 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.080

 solar system and comet gallei 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.430
