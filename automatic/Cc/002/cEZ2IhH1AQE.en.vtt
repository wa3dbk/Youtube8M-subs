00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.830
 let's reread the rules together for the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.770
 conversion from track 10 bad we go 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.450
 excuse the display in order 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.759
 rule number one numbers I love the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.059
 right-to-left positions 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.600
 let's go here rule number two usage 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.660
 powers of 23 binary numbers with 10 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.390
 I consider them in the sum 4 this is 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.340
 very important because the key to the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.830
 conversion to match decimal or 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.050
 the powers of 2 and the are between them 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.600
 manate to position it in the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.059
 rule number no wait for a position 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.620
 of the left therefore I am among them 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.440
 the powers raised to the position 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.170
 multiplied by the binary digit rule 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.660
 number 5 any number raised to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.860
 power of zero is always one also a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 million 153 1857 raised to zero comes 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 a simple style 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 let's skip from rule number 5 the rule 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.870
 number 6 and any number x 1 and always 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.879
 himself regulates 7 in other words results between 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.250
 of them that the rule 8 that more than 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.880
 rule a check tells us that i 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100
 binary numbers ending here it is 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 the number rule other binary numbers that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.409
 ending with zero are always even 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.330
 instead bad while those that end 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.009
 with one I am sparring 10 maric e 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.280
 vice versa or rather even numbers 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.590
 bad always end for 0 the track 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.829
 and the odd numbers decimal type 9 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.049
 end for one and the equa is one in 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.619
 binary 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:38.460
 so let's do one last exercise with 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:43.649
 we cancel these last migrations 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 as my anger says because we have 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.899
 also scribbled too finely 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.210
 therefore of signals we already visualize c 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.369
 a whole page be patient 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.119
 we are pointing to this tool 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.790
 fascinating to write on screen 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.149
 so let's do a re-educational exercise 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.570
 com conversion 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.630
 someone tells us up 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.149
 bnl get write badly 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.780
 slowly we will improve from the track 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:19.600
 arrow a good at the remains 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.120
 here we are tell you the number ok ve 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:32.230
 I say so 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:35.890
 10 11 10 03 01 very difficult not 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.340
 read like 101 million and 110 thousand e 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.140
 one because they kick you out but 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.200
 read it as one when reading 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.560
 delete reads digit for about 10 11 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.870
 10 00 1 then rule 8 you remember 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.040
 ends for one as a result instead 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.510
 badly it will have to be like the shot then 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.110
 will be an odd number one decimal 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.209
 ok and let's start then innumerable 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.580
 position positions from right to left 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.350
 then position 0 opposition one 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:14.110
 position 23 pages grandfather 4 up to here 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:19.269
 there are 5 6 7 and 8 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:22.660
 the first use the powers of 22 high 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.700
 to the position so use could 2 e 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.700
 applying a short rules said before 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.090
 to state earlier but let's go 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 well 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.250
 we do not consider the figures with the zero there 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.709
 we don't care much because so much 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.750
 even if we have a million x to stay 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.470
 always zero since we are going to do with 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.560
 me I brutally go to the zeros 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.989
 so I only consider this this 1 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.030
 this in its position this that 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:55.030
 this they highlight so I do here 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.120
 I consider this one to this this 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.670
 this and this so you see there 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.140
 scared we are the pen not there 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.360
 be scared in case you see a 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.450
 a huge number in track because of the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.550
 end of the many figures that 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.470
 they were 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.630
 considering only one two three 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.510
 four five digits very simple 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.360
 let's start powers of 22 raised to 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.700
 zero then elevated the summed position 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.360
 to what to this the position number 4 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:28.230
 which increases from 22 to 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.350
 position of the goes from the fourth plus one 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:36.030
 another two powers of 2 and raised to 5 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.090
 just correct me more 2 raised to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.910
 position therefore elevated the series plus 2 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.880
 raises the thing la7 no because at 0 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.720
 it does n't interest us but elevated to the 8 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.580
 here it is the same myth is enough where 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.580
 we went let's just add up 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.740
 view the sum is yes but the areas 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.180
 you can use the curator you can 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.400
 do it because i fight maybe a little 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.510
 difficult otherwise it does so from while the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.570
 first date bellina the 2 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.790
 so let's start down here maybe 2 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.220
 raised to zero any rule 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.280
 number in da zara is always one i know 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:16.050
 I was no longer where he was from the fourth and 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.260
 let's make the 2 x 24 x 28 x 2 16 plus 16 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.320
 fifth number or redo it or not 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.770
 we do nothing but the double of 16 32 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.460
 because because we have two x 24 x 28 x 2 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.180
 16 for 232 plus 2 the sixth double of 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.100
 32 64 more difficult and me here 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.280
 we will take it because I do this 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:47.100
 so two high or two 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:52.850
 equal equal equal 48 we have 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:06:01.080
 done 2 x 2 then 2 1 to 2 is 4 by three 8 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:03.750
 14 16 45 32 26 64 2 la7 at 128 28 and 256 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:08.280
 can work to have security for 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:11.510
 don't look bad anymore, then 256 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:16.140
 let's start by adding 256 yes 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.910
 adding then give me the 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.400
 calculator you 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:30.150
 they were so killing you 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:35.430
 roberto excel 256 plus 64 plus 32 plus 16 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:37.140
 more pure than road 369 or vi 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.540
 remember when we then write the 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.470
 result 300 was difficult 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.420
 we had given it 69 369 of spanÃ² 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.970
 you see that ends for 9 so much is true 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.280
 we were there as an initial check 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.230
 just pinned here by shot 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.270
 why because from one of the regulations that 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.490
 we were assigned before is any 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.430
 binary number and ends by one instead 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.240
 bad from the always star is in fact it is of 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.820
 shot 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.530
 so in the next exercise we start a 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.750
 schematize with rules la 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.610
 Reverse-run for decades to 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.830
 binary and then do some exercise 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.050
 together analogous to this if there is 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.500
 liked as that thumb up of 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.620
 youtube 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.780
 maybe commented also advised 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.820
 some topic of your interest 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.530
 ok bye see you in the next video 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.530
 repetition good day everyone
