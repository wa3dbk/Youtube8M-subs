00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello my ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.080
 welcome to this video today it is 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.269
 to continue the universe mode of www tk 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.490
 The tukan was a livestream 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.830
 presents presented the innovations 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 were shown I have the film unfortunately 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 I could not quite follow it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.869
 beginning not yet there is only 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.070
 get in the middle of it with the always 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.570
 to look at it completely again 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.519
 but this i have gotten around with 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.890
 the topic is king today 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.990
 of the ring in universe mode the against 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.160
 Last year, not yet there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.219
 we can not do king of the ring yet 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.270
 tournament therefore hold no real 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.280
 went on you intone you would have 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.079
 maybe I can somehow well tell 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.829
 somehow simulate with the matches 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.210
 but no matter 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.070
 Definitely a real treat on the way 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 ring tournament did not exist at w13 yet 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.390
 that is now available in wwe tv team here 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 on this screenshot I have since 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 by the way as based on screenshots there 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.760
 that's a bit easier than to 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920
 I also believe that I have the others 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.809
 no more picture so no video material 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 from the live stream may use 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.210
 so I consider myself just once a 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.399
 pictures and also for that the clear yes so 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 Here you can see on this one now 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 screenshot for a very clear 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.520
 the junior smart fortwo putin should 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.420
 look good with play matches on the left 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 probably all over again 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.130
 german calendar rivalries wb.com den 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.590
 juniors with edit so now though 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.869
 here to the picture here that is just one 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.580
 show edit the admitted are very far 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.299
 even there could also smackdown 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.110
 and just the previews you could all yes 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.700
 edit freely 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.259
 it everything went flawlessly goes 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.390
 maybe this year too 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.049
 Here you can see how over the limit 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.460
 So the preview is edited and 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.400
 At the bottom you can see pay-per-view 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.680
 match that already existed w13 then 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.450
 you could also pay the main event of the pay 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.340
 per views set so what that is 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.549
 For example, I had 13 at the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.030
 june over smoke at extreme rules this 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.840
 fire matchwinner is celebrating that it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.850
 quickly after the fire match just as 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.829
 for example, primus and so on 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.860
 then on and on, then always, yes 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.270
 different matches and meanwhile 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 that went not at meeting in which 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.530
 wwe tv team you can now by now 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.180
 also king of the ring there as main 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.469
 event a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.810
 that is the main event 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:17.030
 king of the ring tournament not be the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.459
 complete pay per view so with the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.079
 match one starts quasi but 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.569
 really only the main event is king of 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.549
 the ring all other matches are still 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.239
 normal then normal human is 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.269
 title matches whatever it is here 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.889
 So this can be set as normal 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:39.049
 You can also do king of the ring tournament 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.459
 here again change the logo of peer 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.620
 Review that means such a real king 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.689
 of the ring pay per view 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.250
 bottom right you can see that pepper 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.629
 view logo is no longer there 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.980
 the limit but since they had king of 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.689
 the ring is set to a whole 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.489
 good thing then reads in the 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.109
 calendar a bit cooler if there 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.719
 really that is king of the ring logo 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.030
 Let's go to the match card now 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.219
 that looks like that here then then 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.260
 as I said before the normal matches in 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:07.189
 wwe day team championship match between 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.409
 dancers and bruce clay and sam ronson 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.150
 rains through the front and then still 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.669
 The rock against John Cena in one 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.719
 rematch what the rivalry match means 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.220
 that's exactly what I'm going to do in another 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.479
 video now go into it again 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.430
 Today, it's all about king of the ring 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.290
 and there you also see the main event 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.790
 is king of the ring you can too 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.709
 hire who in this king of dragon 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.449
 So, the universe makes fashion 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.979
 of course, but you can do it yourself 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.510
 also change that means who accepts 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:32.329
 One can call this king of the ring details 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.829
 I'm self-employed, though 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.199
 not if you can adjust how many 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.609
 So join in 4 8 or 16 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.949
 depending on the moment he gets four heavy 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.139
 But how exactly then you have just only 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.280
 do not even care if you know that 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.530
 can adjust 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.290
 am sure but it is not well 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.699
 not so important but it works for everyone 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.620
 fall with the king of dirt and yes what 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.389
 Incidentally, very cool and that will be in 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.849
 my universe mode let's play on 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.259
 every fall of corp occurs around that 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.609
 this time to mention so king 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.359
 I definitely will of the ring tournament 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.370
 do 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.680
 in my universe mode let's play when 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.359
 exactly so grows ögers will be or 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.519
 replace it because it is not accurate 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.989
 do not care 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.989
 So this is then the match is made 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.459
 and that's what it looks like in the end 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.199
 so king of the ring tournament too 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.519
 that was now or is a king of the 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.739
 ring tournament with eight people triple 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.630
 agent jerry codan käding mysterio siam 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.420
 paragon kofi kingston is under 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.860
 Ryder Sacral is a bit outside 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.080
 he wants the least 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.280
 chance to win against the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.270
 miss, however, had that even 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.860
 won in live stream 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.630
 they had all this simulated except for 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.250
 the last match and zack ryder 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.240
 actually won even against the crap 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.550
 well so therefore it looks looks good 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.620
 we 13 could already be king of the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.780
 Ring does not play in the universe 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.160
 It looked good, too, so that 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.200
 until now not necessarily a 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.870
 improvement and here we will see 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.210
 kane had finally won there then 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.460
 the last pictures like kane the throne 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.130
 As you can see, this is the way to climb 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.850
 Of course the arena of over the 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.290
 limit if there is no king of the ring 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.970
 arena I would give myself one 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.560
 create and then in the same 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.410
 logically the king of the ring 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.050
 tournament or the whole pay-per-view then 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.340
 hold over smart in june 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.690
 So I will be extra for king of 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.670
 put the ring of your own arena 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.230
 if it's not ne king anyway 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.300
 of the ring arena free to play 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.470
 could be purely theoretical what quite 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.230
 Of course it's funny 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.670
 Wrestlemania in question I think that's the case 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.860
 I'm cool so they all exist in the 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.860
 play it yourself that is actually 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.360
 a very cool thing so that 's it 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.570
 already from me my ladies and gentlemen with 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.630
 this video to wwe to pay for team 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.610
 universe mode and king of the ring also 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.650
 I think that's great that it works now 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.110
 I think great class is natural 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.700
 not a great innovation now 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.990
 a little but a pretty cool one 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.030
 I think and as I said I'll be in 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.200
 my ultimately to the universe mode 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.670
 integrate every case 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.980
 You can tell me once in the comments 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.780
 Write what you think that the 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.060
 now it feels cool or if it is 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.290
 you fucking is not doing anyway 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.030
 I would be interested 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.650
 that was so far from me 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.220
 of course, comment and rating very much 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.780
 looking forward 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.780
 bye bye
