00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.740 
the first step you need to see the
pediatrician<00:03:47.000> first<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.480> know<00:03:47.540> this

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
pediatrician first and I know this

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.120 
pediatrician first and I know this
sounds<00:03:48.019> like<00:03:48.049> one<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.320> those<00:03:48.410> guarded<00:03:48.739> cop-out

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
sounds like one of those guarded cop-out

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.530 
sounds like one of those guarded cop-out
answers<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.820> have<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.030> make<00:03:50.180> sure<00:03:50.299> your

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
answers but you have to make sure your

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.000 
answers but you have to make sure your
child<00:03:50.810> doesn't<00:03:51.049> have<00:03:51.170> any<00:03:51.410> other<00:03:51.500> injuries

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
child doesn't have any other injuries

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.160 
child doesn't have any other injuries
and<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.670> think<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.940> psychiatric<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.870> sort<00:03:54.110> of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
and I think a psychiatric and sort of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.979 
and I think a psychiatric and sort of
intellectual<00:03:55.239> paralysis<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.480> important

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
intellectual paralysis is important

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.449 
intellectual paralysis is important
because<00:03:57.110> your<00:03:57.410> child<00:03:57.650> already<00:03:57.950> has<00:03:58.070> an<00:03:58.190> eating

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
because your child already has an eating

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.460 
because your child already has an eating
disorder<00:03:58.579> or<00:03:59.120> wants<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.780> be<00:03:59.900> Mary<00:04:00.260> Lou<00:04:00.440> Retton

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
disorder or wants to be Mary Lou Retton

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.729 
disorder or wants to be Mary Lou Retton
or<00:04:00.950> has<00:04:01.610> really<00:04:02.480> misguided<00:04:03.079> views<00:04:03.320> about<00:04:03.500> what

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
or has really misguided views about what

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.740 
or has really misguided views about what
he<00:04:03.920> or<00:04:04.040> she<00:04:04.070> may<00:04:04.430> accomplish<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.360> may<00:04:05.570> be<00:04:05.630> a

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
he or she may accomplish this may be a

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.349 
he or she may accomplish this may be a
child<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:06.769> driven<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.609> she<00:04:08.000> may<00:04:08.209> in

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
child that is so driven that she may in

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.599 
child that is so driven that she may in
fact<00:04:08.630> go<00:04:09.230> through<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.769> pain<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.370> no

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
fact go through that pain and that no

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.849 
fact go through that pain and that no
pain<00:04:10.880> no<00:04:11.030> gain<00:04:11.060> stuff<00:04:11.750> kids<00:04:12.350> should<00:04:12.530> be<00:04:12.560> warned

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
pain no gain stuff kids should be warned

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.380 
pain no gain stuff kids should be warned
to<00:04:12.980> make<00:04:13.130> sure<00:04:13.340> your<00:04:13.519> kids<00:04:13.790> wear<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
to make sure your kids wear all the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.210 
to make sure your kids wear all the
required<00:04:14.720> safety<00:04:15.049> gear<00:04:15.500> teeth<00:04:15.859> and<00:04:16.070> this

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
required safety gear teeth and this

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.250 
required safety gear teeth and this
isn't<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:16.940> wrist<00:04:17.269> guards<00:04:17.660> right<00:04:17.840> exactly

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
isn't just wrist guards right exactly

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.360 
isn't just wrist guards right exactly
and<00:04:18.380> this<00:04:18.560> next<00:04:18.830> thing<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:18.979> what<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.250> just

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
and this next thing is what you just

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.310 
and this next thing is what you just
said<00:04:19.519> make<00:04:19.789> sure<00:04:19.820> your<00:04:20.239> kids<00:04:20.599> are<00:04:20.780> not<00:04:21.109> the

through pain
all<00:04:23.560> right<00:04:23.650> if<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:23.890> hurts<00:04:24.100> you<00:04:24.400> tell<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.760> coach

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
and you stop and that really means also

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.490 
and you stop and that really means also
parents<00:04:28.000> have<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.300> be<00:04:28.390> in<00:04:28.510> part<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.020> what

I would suspect if you talk to the
Olympic<00:04:46.600> athletes<00:04:46.780> they<00:04:47.350> will<00:04:47.500> tell<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.830> that
