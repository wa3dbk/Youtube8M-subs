end I guess you get to see his his

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.440 
end I guess you get to see his his
passing<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> better<00:01:29.670> running<00:01:29.909> faster

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
passing but it's a better running faster

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.410 
passing but it's a better running faster
oh<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.500> he's<00:01:31.740> okay<00:01:32.130> both<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.150> think

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
oh I think he's okay both but I think

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.789 
oh I think he's okay both but I think
he's<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> better<00:01:33.930> athlete<00:01:34.110> overall<00:01:34.710> he

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
he's just a better athlete overall he

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.469 
he's just a better athlete overall he
can<00:01:34.950> make<00:01:35.100> plays<00:01:35.130> happen<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.820> he<00:01:35.939> needs<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> if

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
can make plays happen if he needs to if

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.179

guys last year tell me what you expect

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.139 
guys last year tell me what you expect
from<00:01:49.680> meadowdale<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.520> obviously<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.970> year

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
from meadowdale and obviously this year

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
from meadowdale and obviously this year
the<00:01:51.240> game<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.720> more<00:01:51.810> impact<00:01:52.799> for

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the game has a little more impact for

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
the game has a little more impact for
both<00:01:53.100> teams<00:01:53.310> yeah<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.210> year<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.720> it's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
both teams yeah this year I think it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.030 
both teams yeah this year I think it's
going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> little<00:01:55.439> bit<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.740> than

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going to be a little bit more than

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.220 
going to be a little bit more than
right<00:01:56.190> because<00:01:56.520> they're<00:01:57.330> in<00:01:57.450> 38<00:01:57.780> west<00:01:57.990> CO<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
right because they're in 38 west CO and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.500
