switching off and let's see what that

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:25.840 
switching off and let's see what that
sounds<00:01:14.450> like

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.940 

let's<00:01:26.850> try<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.119> same<00:01:27.330> thing<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> bride

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
can Shawn want to add a little bit of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:43.279 
can Shawn want to add a little bit of
extra<00:01:31.080> videos

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.669

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
switch and these still stretch set up

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.410 
switch and these still stretch set up
you<00:01:53.920> see<00:01:54.100> how<00:01:54.130> lot<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.609> different<00:01:55.000> come<00:01:55.179> to

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
you see how lot of different come to

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.300 
you see how lot of different come to
notice<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.899> get<00:01:56.049> just<00:01:56.409> from<00:01:56.649> using<00:01:56.859> the<00:01:57.069> right

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
notice you get just from using the right

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.459 
notice you get just from using the right
finish<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.240> we<00:01:58.390> haven't<00:01:58.569> even<00:01:58.689> begun<00:01:59.229> to

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
finish and we haven't even begun to

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.980 
finish and we haven't even begun to
experiment<00:01:59.890> with<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.609> actually<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.509> subside

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
experiment with the actually to subside

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.959 
experiment with the actually to subside
and<00:02:02.200> hacker<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:04.090> look<00:02:04.840> small<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.289> you<00:02:05.770> know

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and hacker so look small and you know

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.710 
and hacker so look small and you know
quite<00:02:06.969> modest<00:02:07.450> but<00:02:07.959> it's<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.289> real<00:02:08.560> killer<00:02:08.950> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
quite modest but it's a real killer so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.949 
quite modest but it's a real killer so
let's<00:02:10.720> try<00:02:11.730> cranking<00:02:12.730> up<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.940> gain<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.209> bit<00:02:13.510> on

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
let's try cranking up to gain a bit on

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.229 
let's try cranking up to gain a bit on
the<00:02:14.319> st.<00:02:14.739> John<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> get<00:02:15.190> more<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.579> lead<00:02:15.849> kind

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
the st. John to get more of a lead kind

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.259 
the st. John to get more of a lead kind
of<00:02:16.329> rocker<00:02:16.690> booster<00:02:17.379> and<00:02:17.440> really<00:02:17.799> know<00:02:18.269> going

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
of rocker booster and really know going

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.600 
of rocker booster and really know going
close<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.569> maxing<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.200> out<00:02:20.379> and<00:02:21.250> see<00:02:21.430> how<00:02:21.549> that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
close to maxing it out and see how that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.640 
close to maxing it out and see how that
sounds

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
sounds

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.490 
sounds
being<00:02:23.650> with<00:02:23.829> stretch

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.010 

okay<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.460> now<00:02:28.850> we're<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.180> second<00:02:29.690> channel

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
okay so now we're in the second channel

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.200 
okay so now we're in the second channel
as<00:02:30.110> well<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.740> can<00:02:31.060> gain<00:02:32.060> free<00:02:32.600> volume<00:02:33.320> at

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
as well and you can gain free volume at

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.600 
as well and you can gain free volume at
roughly<00:02:35.210> nine<00:02:35.830> everything<00:02:36.830> said<00:02:37.070> spread<00:02:37.370> up

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
roughly nine everything said spread up

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.940 
roughly nine everything said spread up
and<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.450> right<00:02:39.020> switching<00:02:39.470> off

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
and that just right switching off

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.130 
and that just right switching off
maybe<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.640> more<00:02:40.850> high-end<00:02:41.150> mode<00:02:41.630> so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
maybe it's the more high-end mode so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:55.949 
maybe it's the more high-end mode so
let's<00:02:42.350> see<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:42.890> described

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:10.800 

and<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.500> next<00:02:58.189> position

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.330 

a<00:03:12.910> lot<00:03:13.910> more<00:03:14.090> grit<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:14.780> we'll<00:03:15.230> really<00:03:15.560> still

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
a lot more grit but we'll really still

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.800 
a lot more grit but we'll really still

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
this up in a metal gig anyway so it's

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.390 
this up in a metal gig anyway so it's

so here with deskey let's try the same
thing<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:41.370> see<00:03:41.640> what<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.910> sounds<00:03:42.239> like

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.130 

still<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:11.920> lot<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.490> definition<00:04:13.210> but<00:04:13.480> we<00:04:13.750> really

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
still a lot of definition but we really

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:23.610 
still a lot of definition but we really
sing

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.210 

a<00:04:24.810> Titan<00:04:25.810> defined<00:04:26.199> even<00:04:26.830> though<00:04:27.010> they're

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
a Titan defined even though they're

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.930 
a Titan defined even though they're
really<00:04:27.790> really<00:04:28.000> hygienic<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.430> then<00:04:30.730> if

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
really really hygienic so and then if

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.520 
really really hygienic so and then if
you're<00:04:31.060> kidding<00:04:31.540> modern<00:04:31.990> mode<00:04:32.169> is<00:04:32.380> basically

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
you're kidding modern mode is basically

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.620 
you're kidding modern mode is basically
it's<00:04:33.190> gonna<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.639> same<00:04:33.850> thing<00:04:34.090> but<00:04:34.270> just

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
it's gonna be the same thing but just

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:43.140 
it's gonna be the same thing but just
more<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.310> let's<00:04:36.490> just<00:04:36.760> try<00:04:37.030> that

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.150 

same<00:04:44.150> sort<00:04:44.389> of<00:04:44.449> thing<00:04:44.660> with<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.900> model

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.950

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
and so you the modern mode is even

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.550 
and so you the modern mode is even
tighter<00:04:55.290> even<00:04:56.040> more<00:04:56.190> defined<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.810> bit<00:04:58.380> more

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
tighter even more defined and a bit more

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.640 
tighter even more defined and a bit more
