 Job bars in the chat will not appear 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.050
 all the options that said plan has 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.630
 for example the first bars jobs 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.730

 space and joint another is a space and 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.960
 let's put 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.700
 the work that we want if 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.430
 they have fret to the server what I have to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.370

 write yourself in 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.850
 the mining constructor and excavated the 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.700
 Lumberjack depends depends also a little 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 of what you are going to do and the subjects 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.260
 that you are going to pick up or come after 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.730
 third parties are usually I put money 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.690
 because the first thing I do is enter 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:53.860
 eliminate so pay I find a little bit of 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.230
 copper to make my house and lumberjack 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.300
 also those two insurances then 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.640
 for example 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.440
 let's say that I want to write me in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.620
 excavator work 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.030
 then we put ops join bars and 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.050
 we write in the work with the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.940
 apparitions to lists and excavated 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.130
 then there the chat shows us a 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.110
 message that satisfactory that says that 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.530
 we have focused on the work of 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.530
 excavator 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.939
 if we want to leave this work what 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.879
 we have to do is put more free ops 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.239
 space and the name of the job to which 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.239
 we're 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.569
 in this case I flip excavator and says 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.630
 that the excavator cables that the 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.200
 we have been 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.790
 of the work of climber I for 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.700
 inspire in things I'm going to go back to 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.900
 sign up 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 the work been 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:02.430
 let's write in the chat see what 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.500
 I am and 2666 see that next to the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.140
 the name appears on my left 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.140
 excavated that that's the job 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.860
 I'm doing at this moment we can 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.770
 have a maximum stack of three jobs 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.720
 at the same time that's why they see that others in 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.210
 the chat for example the little flows 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 64 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.340
 to the left of your nick you have a 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.630
 letter m a back and a letter of these 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.680
 letters are in English is not that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.260
 coincide with the initial of the work the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.900
 of what colors are always that is 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.470
 what you have to notice 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.600
 the letter d of medicare will be or of de 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.780
 dig into English 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.410
 neighborhoods again to see what else there is 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.050
 bars jove stats the command is good 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.300
 because we can see the statistics 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.850
 of experience in which we find ourselves in 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.650
 each of the jobs 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.750
 in this case as I just registered 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.620
 I am in the I am in level 1 and I have 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.620
 experience zero 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.860
 but in the case that you are 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.990
 enrolled and already 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.810
 that have gone to finish with the shovel a 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.190
 little sand or gravel that is going to 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.530
 start about the experience and the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.769
 level automatically in the chat them 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.880
 shows that when they went up in level 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.450
 and the last shops info 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.070
 codename what you crazy this last 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.070
 command for example 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.030
 so I do not know anything like that that says 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:43.060
 tells you what it does or is 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.060
 what material is 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.650
 each work is sent and with what action 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.310
 for example in the lumberjack says that 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.910
 we can break what I do not remember 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.720
 is I think it's a kind of wood but I 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.330
 okay what is it 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.430
 no to five experiences and five dollars 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.460
 elin camps are the pains and expresses 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.529
 true experience 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.009
 place is to put somewhere 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:14.680
 said wood 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:19.120
 and sap link that I think are seeds 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:22.640
 and is mother and kiel 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.060
 7.5 of income for killing a player with 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:31.640
 I guess it will be with the shovel with the 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.100
 ax 7.55 is good the dollars and 7.5 of 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.330
 experience 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.330
 that will give us for each player that 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.789
 let's kill and if we kill 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.819
 a player who is also woodcutter us 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.919
 It gives $ 10 and has experience 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.879
 that says player two points gut cater 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:54.300
 wood caster would be the lumberjack or cutter 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:57.740
 of wood cutter for a 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.740
 more archaic translation 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.890
 pretty simple I hope it 's 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.940
 understood a very important thing for 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:10.480
 highlight is that at this moment 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.560
 I'm just the excavator, let's propose what 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.330
 that I want to have three jobs from 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.060
 same time simply what we have 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.950
 what to do is three times to make a swing 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.650
 for example I am in climber I know 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.009
 I have a job to do a show I'm from 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.800
 woodcutter 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.470
 and you can see how to the left of my 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.840
 nick appears the w and the d 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.840
 and now let's do one last show 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.460
 for example 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.120
 then now when only in the chat to 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:49.770
 the left appears from w 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.950
 it must be difficult wd but kateri from the 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.310
 straight from I'm a climber a lumberjack and 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:58.440
 a fisherman 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.440
 if we want to leave any of 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.569
 of any of the jobs that in the 

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:04.779
 what we do, what we are going to 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:06.160
 do is click jobs bars and we put the 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.050
 fisherman 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.790
 well there we see how we are no longer 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.630
 the fisherman we are only going to be in 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.630
 the tester and the lumberjack 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.260
 If you have any questions polishing in the 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:22.110
 comments 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.110
 the basics that have to cross 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.340
 until next time
