in<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> hip<00:00:55.079> socket<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:56.010> creates<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.610> twisted

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
in the hip socket this creates a twisted

from this twisted relationship the body

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.170 
from this twisted relationship the body
feels<00:01:03.079> stable<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.860> strongest<00:01:04.250> core<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.790> it

feels stable the strongest core and it

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.149 
feels stable the strongest core and it
makes<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.479> much<00:01:05.720> easier<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.500> get<00:01:06.650> into<00:01:06.890> the

amp<00:04:52.020> up<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.740> speed<00:04:53.009> make<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.819> bumps<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.150> little

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
amp up the speed make the bumps a little

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.209 
amp up the speed make the bumps a little
bigger<00:04:54.539> maybe<00:04:54.990> turn<00:04:55.289> up<00:04:55.379> the<00:04:55.499> pitch<00:04:55.710> just<00:04:55.740> a

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
bigger maybe turn up the pitch just a

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.040 
bigger maybe turn up the pitch just a
little<00:04:56.430> bit<00:04:56.550> but<00:04:57.000> notice<00:04:57.389> does<00:04:57.539> that<00:04:57.689> happens

little bit but notice does that happens

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.320 
little bit but notice does that happens
as<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.289> bumps<00:04:58.529> get<00:04:58.710> bigger<00:04:59.009> and<00:04:59.279> the<00:05:00.120> pitch

as the bumps get bigger and the pitch
gets<00:05:00.569> steeper<00:05:01.020> you're<00:05:01.319> going<00:05:01.469> to<00:05:01.529> go<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.680> little

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
gets steeper you're going to go a little

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.740 
gets steeper you're going to go a little
faster<00:05:02.159> you're<00:05:02.939> going<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.150> need<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.389> turn<00:05:03.599> the

faster you're going to need to turn the

faster you're going to need to turn the
legs<00:05:03.960> more<00:05:04.199> strongly<00:05:04.620> intensely<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.699> faster

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
to keep get this kind of feeling you're

to keep get this kind of feeling you're
going<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.490> need<00:05:08.759> stronger<00:05:09.479> movements<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.229> the
