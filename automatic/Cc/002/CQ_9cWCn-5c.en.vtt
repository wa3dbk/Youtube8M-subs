00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 welcome to the online game and a gas bottle sport 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.170
 the game in short 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.260
 Flashpoint is an exciting buy that game about the entire family 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.989
 with seven victims from a burning house before collapsing 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.650
 the fire is spreading every time, talking about victims is always on 

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:20.179
 another place 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.579
 work well together that you win or always lose together 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.059
 with different extra rules to increase the difficulty 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.569
 this tool untreated family version for two players 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.640
 the game step by step 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.710
 lay next to each other 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 I put the game board on the table ago 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.630
 put the pvda tokens next to the board you are a false alarm of two victims 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.040
 by putting it back in the box no 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.310
 in use that there are three no manual to set up the starting setup 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.150
 to build 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.140
 lay the back door crisis is the deen kurt busch and now three weeks after the crisis 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.530
 on the game board 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.130
 Judges go the stones The fire went 6 action and the dice chance 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.400
 playtime 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.080
 however, every player player cards a firefighter in the same suit 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.860
 the rumors about a large part also back in the box 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.070
 put each player and fireman on the field and outside the house and the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.080
 youngest play begins 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.640
 the recovery expires 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.340
 the player who tests at the door goes through the next phase in his turn 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.600
 perform actions 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.780
 in turn you have no promotions 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 you can save unused promotions with a maximum of 4 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.969
 in the bird neighborhood 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.969
 both use as much as you mail 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.600
 move the action 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.290
 after proposing moving without fire costs an action point but moving money with 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.260
 fire costs 2 action points 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.270
 if you are placed to a pv da vinci you can immediately turn it over 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 Suppose it is a false alarm inspection directly on the lawn 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.970
 if not then it will remain 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.890
 while moving but not a victim, I constantly take response 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.660
 points and that may not be restored with fire 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.620
 if you are a victim of outdoor growing, it is saved and still on court 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.980
 be laid 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.790
 a firefighter may be placed through the open door 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.609
 or by damage that also with two damage stones 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.989
 you may not end your turn on the field with fire 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.849
 close the action open the doors 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.489
 if you are standing next to a door you can open or close these action points at the front 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.779
 the action putting it out 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.080
 to extinguish fire 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.429
 you must be on the relevant or adjacent field 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.979
 och removal also costs an action point of making fire large also costs one 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.059
 action point or hour immediately remove two action points 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:42.009
 the hakim action 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:46.089
 you can go for two action points in an hour, the agent had them there as a firefighter 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:50.429
 there is only damage mood with two bowls of stones it is now also a pot and 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:52.129
 you can placed through it 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.399
 a short part has no effect on the rest of the wall 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:59.529
 but when all 24 damage cubes are on the board the house collapses and 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.859
 we lost 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.969
 lead out of the fire 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.839
 the active player comes up with two dice that could spend with one 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.899
 certain money on the game board 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:12.129
 If this is an empty field, then lay down a smoke vision 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.559
 if a logical lag then it becomes a fire business 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.759
 and if there is an attack then there is also with the fire 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.910
 if all functions and lag then an explosion follows 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.619
 this treatment below 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.569
 an explosion 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.329
 if an explosion takes place here, the fire spreads through an agent of the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.139
 however, if it encounters a wall, it will replace damage 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.309
 feature when it comes across a door pops out the door instead 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.539
 guess at an empty field among fire 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.549
 Imagine that there is also a fire that is being hit by a shock wave 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.590
 just until there is an empty sheet at home 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.660
 there comes the fire vicent or near a wall damage block or my door pops 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.709
 he turns 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.409
 an open door does not stop a shock wave or explosion from occurring 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.009
 removed but the fire still comes 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:02.120
 Suppose we now also have chips next to the fire, then there is also fire 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.589
 if after the expansion of the fire a fireman is in the shed 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:09.010
 at this unconscious and he goes to the nearest ambulance spot 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.719
 Suppose that during the explosion two sheep are already laying blocks then it appears 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.719
 fire through the wall this can also be outside the house 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.640
 npg her bike in the shed is turned open 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.870
 and then counted on the loss if he has four victims 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.849
 lost 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 finally remove any fire vision close the house 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.969
 fill the recreation room 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.999
 if you have fewer than three p's army gordon the dice to 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.370
 determine where a new pvda vice will be located 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.699
 pathetic figure marker lay this first away 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.179
 as a firefighter state power with a graphic open days 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.180
 both a little poster was then you need new doblÃ² 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.919
 now it's the next player's turn 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.370
 end of the game 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.650
 the players win immediately when seven victims are hit 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.219
 and lose if four victims are missing 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.520
 they also lose if all damage cubes are on the board because then it will collapse 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.680
 be home 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.729
 is always here you want more you go to services
