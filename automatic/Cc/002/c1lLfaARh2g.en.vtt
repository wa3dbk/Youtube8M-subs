work and I hold my yarn a little

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.700 
work and I hold my yarn a little
different<00:00:17.340> than<00:00:17.550> most<00:00:17.730> crochets<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.560> my

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
loop stitch I'm going to insert my hook

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.840 
loop stitch I'm going to insert my hook
into<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.380> stitch<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.519> bring<00:00:23.699> my

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850

into the stitch I'm going to bring my
ring<00:00:24.090> finger<00:00:24.570> up<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.760> I'm<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.090> yarn<00:00:27.480> over

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
ring finger up and I'm gonna yarn over

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.400 
ring finger up and I'm gonna yarn over
and<00:00:27.840> pull<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:29.010> loop<00:00:29.570> wrapping<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.990> working

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
and pull up a loop wrapping that working

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.569 
and pull up a loop wrapping that working
yarn<00:00:31.439> around<00:00:31.830> my<00:00:32.340> finger<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.870> finish

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
yarn around my finger and then finish

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
yarn around my finger and then finish
that<00:00:35.579> single<00:00:35.969> crochet<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.630> then<00:00:36.690> drop<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that single crochet and then drop that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.700 
that single crochet and then drop that
loop<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.800> loop<00:00:38.010> stitch<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.290> all<00:00:40.290> loop

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
loop for that loop stitch so all loop

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
loop for that loop stitch so all loop
stitches<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.760> single<00:00:42.239> crochets<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
stitches are or single crochets with the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.569 
stitches are or single crochets with the
yarn<00:00:43.440> pulled<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> opposite<00:00:45.300> side<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
yarn pulled out to the opposite side so

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.430 
yarn pulled out to the opposite side so
insert<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.940> hook<00:00:48.120> into<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.570> stitch<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
insert the hook into the stitch and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.580 
insert the hook into the stitch and
wrapping<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.460> yarn<00:00:50.730> around<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.360> ring<00:00:52.199> finger

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
wrapping that yarn around my ring finger

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.819 
wrapping that yarn around my ring finger
yarn<00:00:53.550> over<00:00:53.879> pull<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.899> loop<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.500> yarn

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
yarn over pull up a loop and then yarn

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
yarn over pull up a loop and then yarn
over<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> through<00:00:56.579> two<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.239> drop<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
over and through two and then drop that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.510 
over and through two and then drop that
loop<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.739> insert<00:00:59.690> yarn<00:01:00.690> over<00:01:01.050> pull<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.309> loop

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
loop so insert yarn over pull up a loop

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.760 
loop so insert yarn over pull up a loop
yarn<00:01:03.080> over<00:01:04.080> draw<00:01:04.290> through<00:01:04.920> two<00:01:06.439> insert

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
yarn over draw through two insert

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.990 
yarn over draw through two insert
yarn<00:01:08.670> over<00:01:08.880> yarn<00:01:09.720> over<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.110> draw<00:01:10.229> through<00:01:10.500> two

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
yarn over yarn over and draw through two

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.270 
yarn over yarn over and draw through two
you<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.330> continue<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.250 

so<00:01:16.790> every<00:01:17.210> time<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.600> you're<00:01:17.840> making<00:01:18.400> what's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
so every time that you're making what's

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.380 
so every time that you're making what's
essentially<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.290> single<00:01:21.650> crochet<00:01:21.980> stitch

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
essentially a single crochet stitch

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.420 
essentially a single crochet stitch
you're<00:01:23.390> looping<00:01:23.810> that<00:01:24.470> working<00:01:24.890> yarn<00:01:24.920> around

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
you're looping that working yarn around

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.030 
you're looping that working yarn around
your<00:01:25.940> ring<00:01:26.210> finger<00:01:26.660> or<00:01:26.870> whichever<00:01:27.590> fingers

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
your ring finger or whichever fingers

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.600 
your ring finger or whichever fingers
comfortable<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:30.070> then<00:01:31.070> drop<00:01:31.400> in

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
comfortable for you and then drop in

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.760 
comfortable for you and then drop in
that<00:01:31.820> loop<00:01:32.060> yarn<00:01:32.390> when<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.290> finish<00:01:33.590> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
that loop yarn when you finish the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.520 
that loop yarn when you finish the
stitch

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.180 

so<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.370> finish<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.940> row<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.920> see

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
so when you finish the row you can see

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.520 
so when you finish the row you can see
you<00:01:44.550> just<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> series<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:46.820> fairly<00:01:47.820> uniform

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
you just have a series of fairly uniform

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.920 
you just have a series of fairly uniform
loops<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.479> working<00:01:51.660> it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
loops if you if this is just working it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.340 
loops if you if this is just working it
snugly<00:01:52.500> around<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.610> ring<00:01:53.820> finger<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.960> gave

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
snugly around my ring finger and it gave

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.700 
snugly around my ring finger and it gave
a<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:56.510> pretty<00:01:57.510> even<00:01:57.869> set<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.170> loops<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a pretty pretty even set of loops and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
a pretty pretty even set of loops and
that's<00:01:58.830> what<00:01:59.130> loop<00:01:59.340> stitches<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.910> they<00:02:00.240> just

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that's what loop stitches are they just

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
that's what loop stitches are they just
have<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.660> loop<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> front<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> stitch

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
have a loop in the front of the stitch

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.240 
have a loop in the front of the stitch
that<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.490> stands<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.090> kind<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.690> 3d<00:02:04.080> effect

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
that just stands out kind of a 3d effect

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.270 
that just stands out kind of a 3d effect
so<00:02:05.250> that's<00:02:05.430> how<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> loop<00:02:06.030> stitch
