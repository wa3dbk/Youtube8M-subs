00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.070
 ai staff okay ago I did not know 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.839
 what do I want with this window ? 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.000
 voting goes on but it was kind of difficult 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.100
 because of the two portfolios here that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.300
 They are very close to where I was. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 pass the fabric and had thought of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 put the total bulbs around you 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 is a stranger in the childhood version in 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 nothing just those little lights is 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.920
 Natural 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.260
 that's when I went to work with the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 boxes in one of them were things 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.379
 Christmas - that was saved I 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.710
 I find this lamp here that it is 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.710
 now 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.329
 the result stayed if you want 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:01.219
 to know how the line was made that we 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.219
 Let's use Christmas lights. 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.210
 Candy cups avoids either the step 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.080
 At step it's very simple what it goes 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 do 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.180
 Let's get our kitchens to our 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.290
 family and this family people I bought 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 Show 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.970
 she's just so cute she reminds me 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.800
 a flower 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 you can do with others also 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.030
 we want a model today is going to be this 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.730
 because we're going to make her look alike 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.220
 with a dark rose is easy because we 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.830
 Let's do it, let's get a pencil one. 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.479
 scissors you are at home for 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.380
 to heal I liked the middle of it here 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.060
 and I'm going to make a small hole enough 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.290
 so that the line lapa da cae 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 this here is my LED is those 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.479
 Little Ones, what are we going to do? 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.100
 after making that hole we 'll go 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.100
 wait for it to fit in the future 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.450
 only then she looks pretty cute is already 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.050
 A cute one but after that we 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.060
 Let's do it, let's get her. 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.060
 Let's have a little strip. 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.790
 The Rotary 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.490
 Look how cute 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.870
 stay very beautiful stay the same 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.120
 obviously I loved the idea is not 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.209
 very different as I am very 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.560
 anxious and today I get to hang 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.830
 before to put the families 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.590
 but your home you can put before 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:54.590
 I'll come and look for the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.540
 with the crepe tape can last this too 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:05.620
 The ink that you have at home, I'll 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.620
 get fix wing on the wall 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.930
 so we alone without bars and not 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.230
 it was nice how it looks 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.680
 cool, but we will increase because 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 Now we're going to get the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.569
 to put lights on 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.260
 It's already pretty cool. 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.450
 The effect of the store was cute but we 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.800
 Let's increase this we'll get 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.550
 she 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.820
 Let's have a little bit of a break. 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:57.569
 here below and she will stay with the 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:00.090
 If a flower can see if you 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:05.660
 still it is not very logical that it will seek 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.660
 You wait now you're living 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:19.769
 pretty crazy today come'll take the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.060
 see mine I'll stick in the middle is small 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.360
 same 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:30.790
 I'll get the lamp and put it with the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.409
 family like this upside down 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:39.209
 the bridge defender 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:42.369
 what now if you want to leave like this 

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:45.009
 It's up to you, I told you, you do it. 

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:48.459
 Do you like to buy another color? 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.349
 I preferred to do white because of the 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:05:00.009
 my furniture that is merely pulled by a 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:05:02.319
 frog pull the honvÃ©d and only but already with you and 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.499
 you will do this process at all in the 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.499
 band 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.500
 My routine then remembered. 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.780
 I see results and put very cute 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.630
 a gaza you do not need to use 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.940
 only one window you can put in the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.360
 head of the bed to place the mayor 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.590
 a party is just to use the imagination and 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.450
 let it go 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.430
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.320
 I liked it, I'll leave it on the blog. 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.690
