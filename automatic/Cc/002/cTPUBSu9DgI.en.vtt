00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.040
 and practice with human corpses is already 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.540
 thing of the past here at the university 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.000
 of the mexico valley dozens of 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.980
 students learn medicine thanks to 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.960
 these simulators in a therapy room 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.419
 intensively identical to what the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.189
 best hospitals in the country 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.080
 we found in this simulated hospital 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.150
 with more than 20 high- fidelity robots 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.989
 follow me let's see how they behave 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.250
 the students 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 in this clinical scenario 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.730
 this is how you work every day 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.769
 with students from the first 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.120
 semesters teaching them how they should 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.190
 behave inside a room 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.110
 emergencies of an operating room in a room 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.940
 intensive therapy what are we doing 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.670
 seeing right now the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.199
 many are doing an exercise of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.610
 simulated an accident that there was and 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.500
 the patients came to the area of 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.049
 emergencies and they are having to give 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.030
 cardiopulmonary resuscitation the goal is 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.440
 identify the first symptoms and 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.960
 causes of admission to the emergency department 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.600
 for example with patients suffering from 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.289
 cardiac arrest we are seeing more than 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.080
 nothing the interaction as a patient doctor 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.670
 as it should be in a case of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.890
 emergencies like the one that right now we are 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.350
 simulating it is very important to do this 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.300
 type of practices since we then we 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.090
 is preparing from before for what 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.429
 it would be life 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.920
 we are in the second semester and if we 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.659
 benefits since we can see how 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.210
 mistreat a patient and how to do it 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.009
 I am correctly in the second semester 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.479
 I think it's great that the 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.969
 university have this since we 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.549
 prepared since the arrival of the new 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.159
 technologies to the classrooms is looking higher 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.539
 precision 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.539
 the talking about space 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.900
 taking 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.979
 stalin 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.380
 the case is cutting and you are 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.650
 going to fellow pediatrician who goes to 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.520
 give 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.130
 and we take them to the room 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.260
 intensive pediatric degrees 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.660
 the import equipment that exceeds 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.610
 the 3 million pesos are used to 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.190
 measure vital signs the attention 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.320
 blood and heart rate 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.940
 before this did not exist in the first 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.190
 semesters of medical school 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.650
 now the boys from very early 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.720
 you can start practicing with the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.460
 care in an emergency room for 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.290
 than in the fourth or fifth semester that 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.880
 they are going to visit a real emergency room 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.450
 already have the necessary knowledge 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.670
 to be able to act as it should be with 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.410
 these high-fidelity simulators are 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.420
 gives the student more confidence 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.570
 to concentrate on mastering the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.250
 techniques without feeling stress without a doubt 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.650
 investing in technology has been the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.720
 bet of the best institutions 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.060
 educational tomorrow in the second part of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.950
 our special report we will tell you that 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.260
 is the virtual touch table in third 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.140
 dimension and with university has been the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.800
 first to use it for mexico a day 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.800
