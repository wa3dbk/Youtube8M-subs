00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.820 

an<00:01:46.710> area<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> book<00:01:47.280> front<00:01:47.580> plant<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.090> form

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
an area of the book front plant to form

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.649 
an area of the book front plant to form
and<00:01:49.830> do<00:01:50.039> my<00:01:50.190> client<00:01:50.549> brag<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.210> done

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and do my client brag to get this done

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
and do my client brag to get this done
I've<00:01:51.780> got<00:01:51.930> clamps<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.440> both<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.830> bottom<00:01:53.039> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I've got clamps on both the bottom and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.969 
I've got clamps on both the bottom and
from<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> top<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:55.020> bow<00:01:55.229> front<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.560> about<00:01:55.710> four

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
from the top the bow front is about four

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
from the top the bow front is about four
and<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.130> half<00:01:56.159> inches<00:01:56.820> tall<00:01:57.170> which<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.320> little

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and a half inches tall which is a little

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050 
and a half inches tall which is a little
bit<00:01:58.590> longer<00:01:58.830> than<00:01:59.009> face<00:01:59.340> these<00:01:59.549> parallel

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
bit longer than face these parallel

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.340 
bit longer than face these parallel
clamps<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> plant<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> from<00:02:01.229> both

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
clamps so I plant it from both

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.749 
clamps so I plant it from both
directions<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.250> sure<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.580> good

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
directions to make sure get good

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.300 
directions to make sure get good
clamping<00:02:03.210> pressure<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> first<00:02:05.100> time

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
clamping pressure this is the first time

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.919 
clamping pressure this is the first time
I've<00:02:05.490> done<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> clamp<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
I've done a clamp up like this

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.180 
I've done a clamp up like this
and<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.319> couple<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.619> things<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.979> learned

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and a couple of things that I learned

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.520 
and a couple of things that I learned
while<00:02:08.369> doing<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.869> one<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> probably

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
while doing it one is that I probably

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.720 
while doing it one is that I probably
could<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.769> gotten<00:02:10.979> away<00:02:11.100> with<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.519> gluing

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
could have gotten away with just gluing

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.860 
could have gotten away with just gluing
one<00:02:11.910> face<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.610> reefs<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.790> pieces<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.450> put

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
one face of the reefs on pieces I put

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
one face of the reefs on pieces I put
glue<00:02:16.080> on<00:02:16.110> both<00:02:16.410> halves<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.920> know<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.610> put

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
glue on both halves you know it's put

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.090 
glue on both halves you know it's put
glue<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.180> both<00:02:18.660> pieces<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.319> think<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.799> this<00:02:19.890> case

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
glue on both pieces I think in this case

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.340 
glue on both pieces I think in this case
and<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.850> took<00:02:21.000> me<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> few<00:02:21.239> minutes<00:02:21.540> extra<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.140> do

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
and it took me a few minutes extra to do

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.440 
and it took me a few minutes extra to do
that<00:02:22.620> which<00:02:23.519> definitely<00:02:23.819> adds<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.269> when<00:02:24.299> you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
that which definitely adds up when you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.940 
that which definitely adds up when you
only<00:02:24.569> have<00:02:24.750> 10<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.080> 15<00:02:25.380> minutes<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.739> get<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
only have 10 to 15 minutes to get the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.860 
only have 10 to 15 minutes to get the
whole<00:02:26.069> thing<00:02:26.100> done<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.750> had

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
whole thing done and I think if I had

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.809 
whole thing done and I think if I had
spent<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.860> time<00:02:29.069> just<00:02:29.100> putting<00:02:29.640> glue

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
spent out of time just putting glue

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.550 
spent out of time just putting glue
really<00:02:30.030> well<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.540> one<00:02:30.750> face<00:02:31.019> all<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> way

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
really well on one face all the way

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.380 
really well on one face all the way
there<00:02:31.799> all<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.100> way<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> edges<00:02:32.519> that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
there all the way to the edges that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.000 
there all the way to the edges that
would<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.630> been<00:02:33.780> enough<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.410> had<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> lot<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
would have been enough I had a lot of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.300 
would have been enough I had a lot of
squeezed<00:02:35.400> out<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.540> think<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.140> really<00:02:37.560> had

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
squeezed out and I think I really had

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.060 
squeezed out and I think I really had
more<00:02:38.670> than<00:02:38.820> enough<00:02:38.880> glue<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:40.440> another<00:02:40.829> thing

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
more than enough glue and another thing

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.380 
more than enough glue and another thing
that<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.280> learned<00:02:41.579> while<00:02:41.760> doing<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.180> I

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
that I learned while doing this I

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.479 
that I learned while doing this I
started<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.320> middle<00:02:43.500> clamping<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
started in the middle clamping and

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.830 
started in the middle clamping and
really<00:02:45.000> getting<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> pressure<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.720> then

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
really getting the pressure and then

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.680 
really getting the pressure and then
move<00:02:46.019> my<00:02:46.049> way<00:02:46.350> out<00:02:46.970> but<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> did<00:02:48.239> come<00:02:48.450> back<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
move my way out but I did come back and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.500 
move my way out but I did come back and
really<00:02:49.590> cranked<00:02:49.890> down<00:02:49.980> after<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.579> had<00:02:50.880> put<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
really cranked down after I had put on a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.990 
really cranked down after I had put on a
majority<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.019> clamps<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:53.370> think<00:02:53.609> it<00:02:53.850> would

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
majority of clamps and I think it would

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.090 
majority of clamps and I think it would
work<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.329> little<00:02:54.450> bit<00:02:54.630> better<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.829> spent<00:02:56.070> more

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
work a little bit better if I spent more

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.030 
work a little bit better if I spent more
time<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.820> start<00:02:57.120> clamping<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.140> middle<00:02:58.500> really

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
time to start clamping the middle really

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.009 
time to start clamping the middle really
cranking<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.790> down<00:02:59.820> get<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.299> most<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.870> out

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
cranking it down get the most I can out

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.979 
cranking it down get the most I can out
of<00:03:01.049> these<00:03:01.290> Center<00:03:01.769> clamps<00:03:02.250> first<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.660> they're

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
of these Center clamps first so they're

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.259 
of these Center clamps first so they're
done<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:05.220> start<00:03:05.549> moving<00:03:05.670> my<00:03:05.910> way<00:03:05.940> out

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
done and then start moving my way out

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.449 
done and then start moving my way out
with<00:03:06.480> more<00:03:06.720> clamps<00:03:07.109> that<00:03:07.260> would<00:03:07.380> allow<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
with more clamps that would allow the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.240 
with more clamps that would allow the
pieces<00:03:08.790> slip<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.600> get<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:10.890> tight<00:03:11.040> here

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
pieces slip and get it really tight here

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.099 
pieces slip and get it really tight here
at<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.609> start<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.359> tight<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.840> next

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
at the start and really tight the next

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.840 
at the start and really tight the next
ones<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.440> then<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> way<00:03:13.890> down<00:03:13.920> rather

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
ones and then all the way down rather

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.330 
ones and then all the way down rather
than<00:03:15.239> putting<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.140> all<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.440> clamps<00:03:16.739> pretty

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
than putting on all the clamps pretty

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.099 
than putting on all the clamps pretty
tight<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.329> coming<00:03:18.660> back<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.019> watching

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
tight and then coming back and watching

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.190 
tight and then coming back and watching
them<00:03:19.470> down<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.100> think<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.150> really<00:03:21.690> prohibited

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
them down I think I really prohibited

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.400 
them down I think I really prohibited
the<00:03:22.319> slippage<00:03:22.890> by<00:03:23.880> doing<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.630> think<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
the slippage by doing that I think the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.630 
the slippage by doing that I think the
whole<00:03:25.560> thing<00:03:25.680> will<00:03:25.769> turn<00:03:25.920> out<00:03:26.040> pretty<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.310> so

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
whole thing will turn out pretty well so

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.199 
whole thing will turn out pretty well so
leave<00:03:27.630> these<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.049> for<00:03:28.590> at<00:03:28.920> least<00:03:29.069> 24<00:03:29.609> hours<00:03:29.639> and

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
leave these on for at least 24 hours and

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.510 
leave these on for at least 24 hours and
then<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.500> will<00:03:31.680> take<00:03:31.889> them<00:03:32.040> all<00:03:32.160> off<00:03:32.400> and

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
then we will take them all off and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.660 
then we will take them all off and
look<00:03:33.700> at<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.820> piece<00:03:34.650> after<00:03:35.650> 24<00:03:36.310> hours<00:03:36.340> of

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
look at the piece after 24 hours of

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.730 
look at the piece after 24 hours of
clamping<00:03:37.060> I've<00:03:37.450> moved<00:03:37.780> all<00:03:37.900> those<00:03:38.080> clamps<00:03:38.410> and

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
clamping I've moved all those clamps and

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.610 
clamping I've moved all those clamps and
here's<00:03:39.250> my<00:03:39.400> piece<00:03:39.960> came<00:03:40.960> out<00:03:41.170> really<00:03:41.500> well

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
here's my piece came out really well

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.900 
here's my piece came out really well
obviously<00:03:42.580> have<00:03:43.210> significant<00:03:44.610> cleanup<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.760> do

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
obviously have significant cleanup to do

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.650 
obviously have significant cleanup to do
on<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.660> glue<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.280> piece<00:03:48.520> looks<00:03:48.940> great

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
on the glue but the piece looks great

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.800 
on the glue but the piece looks great
joints<00:03:50.170> look<00:03:50.320> great<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.940> once<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.270> clean<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.660> up

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
joints look great so once we clean it up

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.720 
joints look great so once we clean it up
the<00:03:53.320> joint<00:03:53.530> turntable<00:03:54.070> so<00:03:54.220> I'll<00:03:54.340> really<00:03:54.520> be

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
the joint turntable so I'll really be

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.120 
the joint turntable so I'll really be
able<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.940> take<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> look<00:03:55.360> at<00:03:55.450> those<00:03:55.890> blue<00:03:56.890> lines

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
able to take a look at those blue lines

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.490 
able to take a look at those blue lines
and<00:03:57.610> see<00:03:57.970> how<00:03:58.090> they<00:03:58.270> turned<00:03:58.480> out<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.350> think

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
and see how they turned out but I think

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.520 
and see how they turned out but I think
they<00:03:59.620> look<00:03:59.770> great<00:03:59.890> from<00:04:00.160> here<00:04:00.540> wax<00:04:01.540> was<00:04:01.870> also<00:04:02.320> I

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
they look great from here wax was also I

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.370 
they look great from here wax was also I
used<00:04:02.890> wax<00:04:03.280> on<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.820> form<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.510> on<00:04:04.870> these<00:04:05.080> pieces

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
used wax on the form and on these pieces

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.000 
used wax on the form and on these pieces
I<00:04:05.950> put<00:04:06.220> one<00:04:06.880> against<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.360> form<00:04:07.630> here<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.350> two

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
I put one against the form here and two

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.690 
I put one against the form here and two
more<00:04:09.510> against<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.720> front<00:04:11.020> and<00:04:11.470> these<00:04:12.370> popped

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
more against the front and these popped

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.070 
more against the front and these popped
right<00:04:13.030> off<00:04:13.060> no<00:04:13.240> problem

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
right off no problem

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.740 
right off no problem
they<00:04:14.320> had<00:04:14.470> wax<00:04:14.710> on<00:04:14.980> them<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.239> worked<00:04:16.600> out

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
they had wax on them so that worked out

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.020 
they had wax on them so that worked out
really<00:04:17.110> well<00:04:17.230> happy<00:04:18.160> with<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.459> I'll<00:04:18.790> clean

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
really well happy with that I'll clean

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.820 
really well happy with that I'll clean
that<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.390> little<00:04:19.510> bit<00:04:19.750> perform<00:04:20.140> as<00:04:20.290> well<00:04:20.320> and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
that up a little bit perform as well and

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.610 
that up a little bit perform as well and
store<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.250> for<00:04:21.640> future<00:04:21.970> use<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.930> then<00:04:23.530> of

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
store that for future use and then of

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.020 
store that for future use and then of
course<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.920> gotta<00:04:24.070> go<00:04:24.220> through<00:04:24.370> all<00:04:24.490> my<00:04:24.520> clamps

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
course I gotta go through all my clamps

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.180 
course I gotta go through all my clamps
and<00:04:25.240> clean<00:04:25.690> those<00:04:25.840> off<00:04:26.110> they<00:04:26.380> were<00:04:26.440> wax<00:04:26.740> before

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
and clean those off they were wax before

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.450 
and clean those off they were wax before
so<00:04:27.640> it's<00:04:28.630> pretty<00:04:28.750> easy<00:04:28.870> pop<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.470> glue<00:04:29.950> off<00:04:30.160> and

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
so it's pretty easy pop the glue off and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.250 
so it's pretty easy pop the glue off and
I'll<00:04:30.910> put<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> little<00:04:31.330> more<00:04:31.450> wax<00:04:31.720> back<00:04:32.050> on

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
I'll put a little more wax back on

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.860 
I'll put a little more wax back on
before<00:04:32.650> put<00:04:32.800> them<00:04:32.890> back<00:04:33.010> on<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.250> clamp<00:04:33.460> rack

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
before put them back on the clamp rack

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.480 
before put them back on the clamp rack
I've<00:04:34.870> tried<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.140> couple<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.530> things<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.980> clean

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
I've tried a couple of things to clean

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.510 
I've tried a couple of things to clean
up<00:04:36.670> this<00:04:36.910> edge<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.890> glue<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.400> that's

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
up this edge here of the glue and that's

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.010 
up this edge here of the glue and that's
been<00:04:39.670> left<00:04:39.850> over<00:04:40.000> quite<00:04:40.390> a<00:04:40.420> bit<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.720> squeezed

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
been left over quite a bit of squeezed

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.200 
been left over quite a bit of squeezed
out<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:42.310> going<00:04:42.460> through<00:04:42.550> cleaning<00:04:42.880> up<00:04:43.060> I've

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
out so going through cleaning up I've

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.380 
out so going through cleaning up I've
got<00:04:43.360> an<00:04:43.450> old<00:04:43.570> chisel<00:04:44.020> here<00:04:44.200> I<00:04:44.410> tried<00:04:45.390> chisel

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
got an old chisel here I tried chisel

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.570 
got an old chisel here I tried chisel
try<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:46.960> raise<00:04:47.200> your<00:04:47.380> blade<00:04:47.590> it's<00:04:48.010> pretty<00:04:48.340> hard

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
try to raise your blade it's pretty hard

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.270 
try to raise your blade it's pretty hard
stuff<00:04:49.150> what<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.020> found<00:04:50.320> works<00:04:50.500> really<00:04:50.650> well<00:04:51.010> is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
stuff what I found works really well is

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.310 
stuff what I found works really well is
taking<00:04:51.580> an<00:04:51.670> old<00:04:51.790> chisel<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.420> just<00:04:52.510> scraping

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
taking an old chisel and just scraping

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.070 
taking an old chisel and just scraping
it<00:04:53.470> so<00:04:54.340> here's<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.640> bunch<00:04:54.790> of<00:04:54.970> glue<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.660> just

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
it so here's a bunch of glue and just

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.840 
it so here's a bunch of glue and just
gonna<00:04:56.350> pretty<00:04:56.620> tight<00:04:57.750> it's<00:04:58.750> working<00:04:59.110> along

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
gonna pretty tight it's working along

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.760 
gonna pretty tight it's working along
and<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.930> glue<00:05:02.230> really<00:05:03.180> scrapes<00:05:04.180> off<00:05:04.770> into

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
and that glue really scrapes off into

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.710 
and that glue really scrapes off into
these<00:05:05.920> shavings<00:05:06.400> here<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:06.880> pretty<00:05:07.420> quickly

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
these shavings here and pretty quickly

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:18.840 
these shavings here and pretty quickly
get<00:05:08.200> down<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.620> wood<00:05:17.160> I'm<00:05:18.160> using<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.520> form

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
get down to the wood I'm using the form

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.120 
get down to the wood I'm using the form
here<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.480> clamp<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:20.650> keep<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:20.950> nice<00:05:21.070> and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
here and a clamp to keep it nice and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.520 
here and a clamp to keep it nice and
steady<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.880> pretty<00:05:22.690> quickly<00:05:23.020> I'm<00:05:23.260> able<00:05:23.500> to

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
steady and pretty quickly I'm able to

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.000 
scrape off that extra glue get down to
the<00:05:27.490> would<00:05:27.780> have<00:05:28.780> before<00:05:29.200> taking<00:05:29.590> this<00:05:29.680> over

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
the would have before taking this over

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:48.120 
the would have before taking this over
to<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.310> jointer

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.610 

I've<00:05:49.130> got<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.550> curve<00:05:50.000> cleaned<00:05:50.510> up<00:05:50.690> it's<00:05:51.500> not

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
I've got the curve cleaned up it's not

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.440 
I've got the curve cleaned up it's not
quick<00:05:51.920> to<00:05:51.950> final<00:05:52.370> dimension<00:05:52.490> yet<00:05:52.970> but<00:05:53.420> I

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
quick to final dimension yet but I

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.650 
quick to final dimension yet but I
jointed<00:05:54.380> one<00:05:55.250> side<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.910> then<00:05:56.240> cut<00:05:56.450> on<00:05:56.570> the

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
jointed one side and then cut on the

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.140 
jointed one side and then cut on the
table<00:05:56.780> saw<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.170> other<00:05:57.440> so<00:05:58.400> we<00:05:58.490> have<00:05:58.580> nice

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
table saw the other so we have nice

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:10.230 
table saw the other so we have nice
clean<00:05:59.480> faces<00:05:59.810> there<00:06:00.760> now<00:06:01.760> I'll<00:06:01.880> use<00:06:01.910> that
