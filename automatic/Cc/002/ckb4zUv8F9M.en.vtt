00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.799
 for deciding to buy the grain and 10 of 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.780
 October so today it comes to me 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.180

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.610
 test but on road and I'm going to 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.410
 accompanying sansÃ³ animation that is 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.750
 different from the branch so many 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.130
 thank you for receiving us care 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.619
 record opportunity 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.600
 welcome you to the questions in 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.460
 today we are going to see a way 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.039
 short but when you feel comfortable 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.599
 of our new sees clearly already in itself 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.599
 I love it but it never hurts to do 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.000
 but adjoining now yes on 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.399
 road we can see from entering 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.070
 good is the automatic version as 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.500
 seeing is much more like easier to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.989
 manage in companies live very well 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.579
 equipped on its left side of the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.690
 flyer we have the bluetooth by 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.320
 of course the green button and there you can use 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.320
 Anyone 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.119
 then in addition to controlling people 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.710
 more and the music I have here this is called 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.509
 the computer on board a computer 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.009
 I keep what he does is give him the 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.200
 fuel efficiency at the same time 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.119
 let them tell you how many kilos a lot of 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.399
 missing so that if they have no gas and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.979
 as don tommy de monex told us how and 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:31.000
 has electricity address and that now 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.829
 yes I understand it absolutely sexual and what 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.329
 good is that acting speeds are going 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.979
 putting a little more shine so that 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.869
 you do not lose control of the izea 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.090
 easy to handle 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.209
 well here we are an automatic decade 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.909
 but that work does xtronic what 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.500
 means that from the last side that 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.170
 you can handle it manually by 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.479
 example if you do it down low low low 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.030
 the changes there we are in first and if 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.149
 he wants to upload what he does is up 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.640
 normal income we already know the cost of 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.909
 vehicle but there is an equal tip of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.500
 important and 10 in what colors to buy 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.569
 with the colors we have 12 different 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.060
 colors we have two types of white 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.210
 we have three types of grays we have 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.980
 black 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.980
 it is already orange depends on the color
