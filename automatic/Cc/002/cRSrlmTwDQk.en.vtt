00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.290
 nor did I see it not as a vote with one more 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.030
 video in this book teach you how to make a 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:19.220
 bracelet with your fans 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:26.080
 before that we'll need the fans 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.080
 that we no longer use scissors and iva 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.550
 we are here at the top 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.679
 now just join the two ends and 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.679
 create above 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.410
 but I understand the safe inside or even 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.410

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:32.450
 the ideal length for our brush 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:36.470
 I'll always do the same shape we 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.470
 Places the next mission 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.930
 As you can see, we have already finished our 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.380
 now that in the end give us a 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.380
 new group 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.040
 now you can take it out of the act 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.289
 Now let's go out here. 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.620
 now with the help that these tips 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:44.830
