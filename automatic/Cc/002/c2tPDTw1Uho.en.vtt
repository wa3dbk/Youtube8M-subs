um I think that I'd rather see a full

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.140 
um I think that I'd rather see a full
length<00:04:59.530> before<00:04:59.680> giving<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.400> full<00:05:00.670> judgement<00:05:00.910> of

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
length before giving a full judgement of

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.910 
length before giving a full judgement of
what<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.390> band<00:05:01.600> could<00:05:02.200> do<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:02.620> don't<00:05:02.770> have
