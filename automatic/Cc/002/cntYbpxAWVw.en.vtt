its source
well<00:05:32.729> actually<00:05:32.910> where<00:05:33.539> it<00:05:33.630> dumps<00:05:33.900> into<00:05:34.080> and

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
creek and hopefully we can find some

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.260 
creek and hopefully we can find some
prints<00:05:38.190> or<00:05:38.310> some<00:05:38.520> kind<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:38.850> sign<00:05:39.030> there's

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
prints or some kind of sign there's

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.360 
prints or some kind of sign there's
something<00:05:39.570> on<00:05:39.690> each<00:05:39.840> side<00:05:40.080> that's<00:05:40.889> gonna<00:05:41.039> be

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
something on each side that's gonna be

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.480 
something on each side that's gonna be
our<00:05:42.030> best<00:05:42.270> chance<00:05:42.419> right<00:05:42.780> now<00:05:42.900> because<00:05:43.490> it's

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
our best chance right now because it's

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.540 
our best chance right now because it's
actually<00:05:45.530> soft<00:05:46.530> enough<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.979> really<00:05:47.160> hold<00:05:47.430> a

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
actually soft enough to really hold a

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.550 
actually soft enough to really hold a
print<00:05:47.880> a<00:05:48.180> lot<00:05:48.660> of<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:48.840> ground<00:05:49.050> out<00:05:49.260> here<00:05:49.289> is

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
print a lot of the ground out here is

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.159 
print a lot of the ground out here is
started<00:05:49.860> to<00:05:49.950> freeze<00:05:50.220> and<00:05:50.700> right<00:05:51.510> now<00:05:51.690> right<00:05:51.960> by

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
started to freeze and right now right by

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.200 
started to freeze and right now right by
the<00:05:52.229> water<00:05:52.590> it's<00:05:53.160> still<00:05:53.460> soft<00:05:53.669> enough<00:05:53.820> where

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
the water it's still soft enough where

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.900 
the water it's still soft enough where
we<00:05:54.960> might<00:05:55.139> find<00:05:55.200> something<00:05:55.860> so<00:05:56.130> I<00:05:56.340> don't<00:05:56.729> know

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
we might find something so I don't know

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.150 
we might find something so I don't know
we're<00:05:57.690> about<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.870> check<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.260> out<00:05:58.410> here's<00:05:59.039> what

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
we're about to check it out here's what

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:16.450 
we're about to check it out here's what
the<00:05:59.250> creek<00:05:59.430> looks<00:05:59.580> like<00:05:59.849> it's<00:06:00.630> pretty<00:06:00.810> cool

together<00:06:27.570> we<00:06:28.170> got<00:06:28.320> a<00:06:28.350> lot<00:06:28.530> of<00:06:28.650> high<00:06:28.770> grass<00:06:29.040> and

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
together we got a lot of high grass and

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.670 
together we got a lot of high grass and
I've<00:06:29.550> actually<00:06:29.910> seen<00:06:30.420> places<00:06:30.990> in<00:06:31.170> here<00:06:31.440> where

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
I've actually seen places in here where

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.700 
I've actually seen places in here where
there<00:06:31.890> was<00:06:32.010> big<00:06:32.550> tracks<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:34.050> I<00:06:34.230> couldn't<00:06:34.530> make

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
there was big tracks and I couldn't make

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.670 
there was big tracks and I couldn't make
them<00:06:34.860> out<00:06:34.980> what<00:06:35.340> they<00:06:35.490> were<00:06:36.500> but<00:06:37.500> they<00:06:37.620> were

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
them out what they were but they were

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.130 
them out what they were but they were
just<00:06:37.890> like<00:06:38.040> big<00:06:38.280> big<00:06:38.910> big<00:06:39.660> tracks<00:06:39.960> like

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
just like big big big tracks like

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.540 
just like big big big tracks like
somewhat<00:06:40.560> a<00:06:40.590> Bigfoot<00:06:41.130> track

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
somewhat a Bigfoot track

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.240 
somewhat a Bigfoot track
yeah<00:06:41.700> that's<00:06:42.330> all<00:06:42.450> I<00:06:42.570> can<00:06:42.690> say<00:06:42.960> yeah<00:06:43.530> it<00:06:43.890> stays

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
yeah that's all I can say yeah it stays

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.680 
yeah that's all I can say yeah it stays
into<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.670> grass<00:06:44.880> where<00:06:45.300> it's<00:06:45.540> not<00:06:45.630> really

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
into the grass where it's not really

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.600 
into the grass where it's not really
making<00:06:46.080> an<00:06:46.260> imprint<00:06:46.710> and<00:06:46.890> mud<00:06:47.070> or<00:06:47.280> anything

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
making an imprint and mud or anything

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.240 
making an imprint and mud or anything
right<00:06:48.060> I<00:06:48.420> think<00:06:49.350> that<00:06:49.500> you're<00:06:49.950> onto<00:06:50.100> something

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
right I think that you're onto something

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.710 
right I think that you're onto something
then<00:06:50.700> like<00:06:50.880> I<00:06:50.940> said<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.240> other<00:06:51.270> night<00:06:51.420> I<00:06:51.570> think

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
then like I said the other night I think

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.570 
then like I said the other night I think
that<00:06:52.080> if<00:06:52.200> these<00:06:52.320> things<00:06:52.500> are<00:06:52.710> real<00:06:52.920> they<00:06:53.430> know

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
that if these things are real they know

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.160 
that if these things are real they know
how<00:06:53.730> to<00:06:53.760> walk<00:06:54.030> in<00:06:54.210> the<00:06:54.270> forest<00:06:54.480> and<00:06:54.870> walk<00:06:54.990> out

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.170 
how to walk in the forest and walk out

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.690 
how to walk in the forest and walk out
hearing<00:06:55.470> this<00:06:55.590> kind<00:06:55.860> of<00:06:55.980> you<00:06:56.520> know

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
hearing this kind of you know

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.070 
hearing this kind of you know
environment<00:06:56.970> that<00:06:57.420> leaving<00:06:57.690> tracks<00:06:57.900> right

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
environment that leaving tracks right

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.890 
environment that leaving tracks right
Indians<00:06:58.800> wore<00:06:59.070> the<00:06:59.250> moccasins<00:06:59.820> because<00:07:00.750> they

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
Indians wore the moccasins because they

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.410 
Indians wore the moccasins because they
left<00:07:01.110> probably<00:07:01.350> any<00:07:01.650> track<00:07:01.980> so<00:07:02.970> like<00:07:03.120> I<00:07:03.150> said

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.420 
left probably any track so like I said

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.950 
left probably any track so like I said
we<00:07:03.690> are<00:07:03.900> following<00:07:04.740> water<00:07:05.040> sources<00:07:05.550> and<00:07:05.960> Bill

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
we are following water sources and Bill

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.410 
we are following water sources and Bill
and<00:07:07.140> I<00:07:07.200> ended<00:07:07.500> up<00:07:07.700> finding<00:07:08.700> a<00:07:08.910> really<00:07:09.180> cool

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.420 
and I ended up finding a really cool

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.570 
and I ended up finding a really cool
waterfall<00:07:10.020> like<00:07:10.320> way<00:07:10.560> back<00:07:11.130> here<00:07:11.340> in<00:07:11.460> the

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
waterfall like way back here in the

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.860 
waterfall like way back here in the
woods

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.630 

yeah<00:07:14.870> so<00:07:15.200> you<00:07:15.980> don't<00:07:16.010> have<00:07:16.220> a<00:07:16.250> whole<00:07:16.430> lot<00:07:16.610> of

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:16.640 
yeah so you don't have a whole lot of

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.610 
yeah so you don't have a whole lot of
daylight<00:07:17.030> left<00:07:17.270> probably<00:07:17.570> like<00:07:17.840> an<00:07:18.230> hour<00:07:18.410> and

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
daylight left probably like an hour and

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.740 
daylight left probably like an hour and
a<00:07:18.650> half<00:07:18.860> two<00:07:19.160> hours<00:07:19.550> so<00:07:19.760> we're<00:07:20.300> going<00:07:20.390> to<00:07:20.480> go<00:07:20.600> up

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
a half two hours so we're going to go up

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.380 
a half two hours so we're going to go up
to<00:07:20.900> where<00:07:21.050> the<00:07:21.140> guy<00:07:21.290> saw<00:07:22.250> the<00:07:22.390> possible

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.390 
to where the guy saw the possible

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.500 
to where the guy saw the possible
gorilla<00:07:23.800> Bigfoot<00:07:24.800> and<00:07:25.240> we're<00:07:26.240> gonna<00:07:26.330> try<00:07:26.480> to

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
gorilla Bigfoot and we're gonna try to

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.080 
gorilla Bigfoot and we're gonna try to
figure<00:07:26.720> out<00:07:26.900> what<00:07:27.020> happened<00:07:27.410> there<00:07:27.530> so<00:07:28.090> we're

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
figure out what happened there so we're

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.750 
figure out what happened there so we're
heading<00:07:29.300> there<00:07:29.390> next
