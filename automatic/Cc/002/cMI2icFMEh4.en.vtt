00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.620
 Repair nursing habits 3 minutes theater lactic acidosis number 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.840
 Lactic acidosis is lactic acid produced as a result of anaerobic glucose metabolism 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.580
 It is metabolic acidosis 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:21.740
 hco 3 -is becoming understood with 21mm parley 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:26.660
 The US seat set is a negative landlord What kind of thing is that using three layers 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:31.830
 If you break down glucose, you will produce five carbon oxides 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.260
 Carbon dioxide can be hi-color, so let's just throw it away 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:41.129
 Blood does not lean to acidity 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.089
 However, a man is said to try to break down sugar in the absence of sufficient oxygen. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.400
 It will end 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:53.980
 The state in which a large amount of lactic acid is accumulated is called lactic acidosis 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.020
 What is the cause of lactic acidosis? 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.050
 Anaerobic responses progress 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:05.680
 Shock or multiple organ failure ed ics in that lactic acid is excessively produced 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.010
 There is a passbook etc. in sepsis wound 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.300
 With hypoxia you can not be better 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:19.710
 Serious diabetes Ya is as anaerobic answer is in progress 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:25.000
 There is a thing called or 1 Kondoria form you are using a drug such as biguanide 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:30.550
 As for East Shinsei or higher, there are 10 ministers such as alcohol deficiency 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.790
 Susumu Higashi is a pathway to produce glucose from substances other than carbohydrates . 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.990
 Most shockingly, shock and multiple organ failure 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:44.079
 tic I think whether it will be a missing town 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.110
 As a standard range of lactic acid level, this area is slightly different depending on the hospital, but it is roughly 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:51.430
 0.4 from 1.8mm par utility 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.560
 Or 4 to 16 mg bar dl 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:00.670
 Well, around here you need to look firmly ne whether how or large is correct Is 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.329
 Well if so say ye that and it is after all new search is a look at the lactic acid value 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.490
 View 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.890
 There are some hospitals that can not be measured as well. 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.540
 Let's go 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:18.859
 I do not know whether it is written with the rack in the lac 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.379
 If it is high lactic acidosis, then there is enough blood in the tissue for some reason 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:27.349
 Or oxygen is not inside 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:31.069
 As a result there are no three sides, so the smaller one is not so when trying to break down the glucose 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:36.350
 It is that users will be made 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.830
 The conclusion is that as a result of anaerobic glucose metabolism, lactic acid is overly in favor 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:45.440
 Blood is under acid by Mr. Yu 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.490
 Variety is the cause but is not often shock multiple organ failure DIC background small cub 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.840
 There is 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:58.300
 Lactic acidosis means that the tissue does not have enough oxygen 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.300
 In the end, oxygen will not be sufficient for the internal medicine or blood flow that carries it.
