it was originally made in but seriously

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.160 
it was originally made in but seriously
um<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.340> doesn't<00:02:22.819> matter<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.360> me<00:02:23.390> i<00:02:23.569> watch<00:02:23.870> both

seem<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.980> think<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:29.560> dubbing<00:02:30.560> anime<00:02:31.010> is

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
seem to think that dubbing anime is

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.699 
seem to think that dubbing anime is
wrong<00:02:31.549> I<00:02:31.970> mean<00:02:32.180> not<00:02:32.360> all<00:02:32.510> companies<00:02:33.080> are<00:02:33.560> like

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
wrong I mean not all companies are like

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.199 
wrong I mean not all companies are like
four<00:02:34.010> kids<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.650> they<00:02:36.650> don't<00:02:37.279> up<00:02:37.519> royally

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
four kids and they don't up royally

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.149 
four kids and they don't up royally
like<00:02:38.450> four<00:02:38.749> kids<00:02:39.019> does<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.590> think<00:02:39.889> it's<00:02:40.010> may

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
like four kids does I think it's may

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.089 
like four kids does I think it's may
induce<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.609> fact<00:02:40.849> that<00:02:40.939> for<00:02:41.450> kids<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.139> well

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
induce the fact that for kids is well

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.140 
induce the fact that for kids is well
for<00:02:43.370> kids<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.379> if<00:02:45.379> you're<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.829> over<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.029> age

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
for kids and if you're like over the age

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.839 
for kids and if you're like over the age
of<00:02:47.359> thirteen<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.109> shouldn't<00:02:48.349> be<00:02:48.439> watching

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
of thirteen you shouldn't be watching
