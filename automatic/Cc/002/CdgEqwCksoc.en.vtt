00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.440
 hi friends of tablatures and sheet music 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.000
 puntocom welcome to another video 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.139
 tutorial today we will be 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.020
 learning the colored pollera from the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.640
 sonorous dynamite a song classes like 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.849
 we recognize everything is good 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.420
 simple my name Jonathan Martinez and 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.460
 good let's start 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.830
 pattern number one in this pattern this 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.770
 song has only two patterns are 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.750
 well simple and good during all the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.210
 song is going to alternate one with 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:46.210
 another the pattern one 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:52.520
 this one is going let's do do minor 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.980
 with his third and his fifth would be me 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.760
 retained 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.680
 and Sun 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.270
 and then we will pass 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.300
 to the sustained 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.300
 greater what would be the sustained 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.390
 re 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.369
 and funk 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.530
 then with rhythmic a bit slow it would be 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530
 A) Yes 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.500
 no no 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.260
 Y 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.210
 a little faster similar to the time the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.210
 song and tour would be something like that 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 is a 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.920
 I must indicate in the heights how many 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 times must be born 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.280
 pattern 2 this one we're going to do then 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 followed by pattern 1 each time 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.810
 let's make the changes and it's very similar to 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.490
 pattern 1 the difference is that in the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.910
 previous 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.200
 We once did board chord this time 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.070
 we will stay twice each chord 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.840
 and we come back with two lower third is your 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.840
 fifth we do again 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.720
 then the sharp 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.710
 again 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.510
 now here we are going to do the following 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.690
 to change to do sharp we're going to 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.470
 do 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.470
 yes 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.550
 how would that be with rhythmic like that 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.890
 and to end this pattern and go back to 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.840
 pattern number 1 we are going to stay 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.840
 four times in the sharp 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.260
 and another thing for this pattern we are going to 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.680
 make a turn 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.700
 with this chromatic rise and a spin 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.980
 not so that you understand a little better 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.379
 you can see the hard boards and how 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.379
 it varies between them would be something like that 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.730
 and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.210
 ah 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.770
 Y 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.589
 two 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.320
