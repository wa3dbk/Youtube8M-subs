00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
in performance updates number two was

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.590 
in performance updates number two was
really<00:00:44.480> strange<00:00:44.800> like<00:00:45.800> buffing<00:00:46.700> 'he<00:00:47.090> against

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
really strange like buffing 'he against

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.860 
really strange like buffing 'he against
armor<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.350> also<00:00:49.250> buffing<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.820> c75<00:00:50.540> viper

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
gunner was also against armor in order

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.320 
gunner was also against armor in order
to<00:00:57.470> make<00:00:57.560> them<00:00:57.740> more<00:00:57.890> versatile<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.730> more<00:00:59.120> all

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
to make them more versatile and more all

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.180 
to make them more versatile and more all
round<00:00:59.690> this<00:01:00.290> is<00:01:00.350> at<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.560> same<00:01:00.740> time<00:01:00.920> as<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
round this is at the same time as the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.640 
round this is at the same time as the
episode<00:01:01.700> was<00:01:01.910> nerfed<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.990> counter<00:01:03.380> was

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
episode was nerfed and the counter was

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.460 
episode was nerfed and the counter was
made<00:01:04.009> stronger<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:05.780> they<00:01:05.900> were<00:01:05.960> also

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
made stronger and that they were also

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.490 
made stronger and that they were also
made<00:01:06.710> more<00:01:07.130> into<00:01:07.790> less<00:01:08.690> of<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.900> versatile

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
made more into less of a versatile

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.860 
made more into less of a versatile
vehicle<00:01:09.850> now<00:01:10.850> forming<00:01:11.240> like<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:11.570> with<00:01:11.780> the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
vehicle now forming like this with the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.350 
vehicle now forming like this with the
tank<00:01:12.110> seems<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.560> be<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.710> lot<00:01:12.920> more<00:01:12.980> forgiving<00:01:13.820> by

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
tank seems to be a lot more forgiving by

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.990 
tank seems to be a lot more forgiving by
a<00:01:14.750> lot<00:01:14.990> more<00:01:15.230> people<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:16.580> think<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.880> main

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
a lot more people and I think the main

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.640 
a lot more people and I think the main
reason<00:01:17.060> for<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.780> because<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:18.440> is

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
reason for that is because this is

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.440 
reason for that is because this is
something<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:18.950> anyone<00:01:19.430> can<00:01:19.790> do<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.330> you

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
something that anyone can do and you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.850 
something that anyone can do and you
don't<00:01:20.570> have<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.900> feel<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.260> left<00:01:21.440> out<00:01:21.680> you

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
don't have to feel the left out you

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.080 
don't have to feel the left out you
don't<00:01:22.040> have<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.400> feel<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:22.880> have<00:01:22.970> to

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
don't have to feel that you have to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.520 
don't have to feel that you have to
practice<00:01:23.300> or<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.050> have<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.260> have<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
practice or that you have to have the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.100 
practice or that you have to have the
same<00:01:24.740> scale<00:01:25.070> as<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.850> person<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.870> see

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
same scale as the person that you see

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.800 
same scale as the person that you see
getting<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.950> lot<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> kills<00:01:28.430> with<00:01:28.670> any<00:01:28.909> SF<00:01:29.210> now

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
here we're thinking about the closest in

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.779 
here we're thinking about the closest in
one<00:05:35.580> form<00:05:35.970> quickly<00:05:36.449> farm<00:05:36.720> yeah<00:05:37.520> but<00:05:38.520> there<00:05:38.669> are

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
one form quickly farm yeah but there are

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.830 
one form quickly farm yeah but there are
physical<00:05:39.060> at<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.509> a<00:05:39.539> point

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.879 

I<00:05:48.490> gave<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.520> grenade<00:05:49.970> launcher<00:05:50.389> to<00:05:50.480> the<00:05:50.630> face

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
I gave a grenade launcher to the face

00:05:50.889 --> 00:06:00.969 
I gave a grenade launcher to the face
huh<00:05:58.240> hey<00:05:59.240> Matty<00:05:59.630> no<00:05:59.990> time<00:06:00.199> to<00:06:00.350> waste<00:06:00.530> come<00:06:00.830> on

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979

yeah<00:06:01.340> let's<00:06:01.729> fuck<00:06:02.060> this<00:06:02.360> is<00:06:02.690> taking<00:06:03.020> too<00:06:03.110> long

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.350 

well<00:06:08.750> shooting<00:06:09.199> a<00:06:09.260> saga<00:06:09.590> it's<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:10.340> river

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.820 

so<00:06:14.360> now<00:06:14.450> even<00:06:14.660> if<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.110> clearly<00:06:15.440> isn't<00:06:15.680> the

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
so now even if this clearly isn't the

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.520 
so now even if this clearly isn't the
best<00:06:16.070> place<00:06:16.220> for<00:06:16.730> an<00:06:16.910> H<00:06:17.150> II<00:06:17.180> tank<00:06:17.660> I<00:06:17.900> had<00:06:18.290> to

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
best place for an H II tank I had to

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.930 
best place for an H II tank I had to
decided<00:06:18.980> that<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.100> wanted<00:06:19.430> to<00:06:19.490> try<00:06:19.730> it<00:06:19.760> out

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
decided that I wanted to try it out

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.750 
decided that I wanted to try it out
because<00:06:20.630> I<00:06:20.780> barely<00:06:21.230> have<00:06:21.620> used<00:06:21.890> it<00:06:22.070> before<00:06:22.310> I

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
because I barely have used it before I

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.520 
because I barely have used it before I
think<00:06:23.300> ap<00:06:23.780> would<00:06:24.020> have<00:06:24.140> been<00:06:24.260> a<00:06:24.290> better<00:06:24.410> choice

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
think ap would have been a better choice

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.680 
think ap would have been a better choice
at<00:06:24.920> least<00:06:25.100> there<00:06:25.370> once<00:06:25.670> or<00:06:25.910> twice<00:06:26.090> of<00:06:26.420> these

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
at least there once or twice of these

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.570 
at least there once or twice of these
pawns<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.320> we<00:06:27.740> didn't<00:06:27.950> spawn<00:06:28.100> quite<00:06:28.370> a<00:06:28.400> lot

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
pawns and we didn't spawn quite a lot

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.240 
pawns and we didn't spawn quite a lot
cost<00:06:29.060> would<00:06:29.480> you<00:06:29.570> play<00:06:29.750> very<00:06:29.900> risky<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:30.740> we

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
cost would you play very risky and we

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.720 
cost would you play very risky and we
did<00:06:31.490> lose<00:06:31.970> our<00:06:32.290> tanks<00:06:33.290> quite<00:06:33.560> a<00:06:33.590> lot<00:06:33.890> but<00:06:34.520> since

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
did lose our tanks quite a lot but since

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.340 
did lose our tanks quite a lot but since
there's<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:35.390> two<00:06:35.540> of<00:06:35.630> us<00:06:35.750> it<00:06:35.990> doesn't<00:06:36.080> really

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
there's the two of us it doesn't really

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.710 
there's the two of us it doesn't really
