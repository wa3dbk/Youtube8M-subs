let's talk about online retail stores
and<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:43.450> was<00:03:43.600> careful<00:03:43.989> not<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.170> say<00:03:44.530> online

and I was careful not to say online

and I was careful not to say online
gaming<00:03:45.340> stores<00:03:45.790> because<00:03:46.209> there's<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.480> growing

purchase<00:03:56.530> from<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:57.010> think<00:03:57.760> it'd<00:03:57.850> be<00:03:57.940> hard<00:03:58.269> to

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
purchase from I think it'd be hard to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.479 
purchase from I think it'd be hard to
argue<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:59.440> one<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.769> main<00:03:59.980> reasons

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
argue that one of the main reasons

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.640 
argue that one of the main reasons
people<00:04:00.549> shop<00:04:00.940> online<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.690> because<00:04:02.470> it's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
people shop online is because it's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.130 
people shop online is because it's
generally<00:04:03.430> cheaper<00:04:03.610> online<00:04:04.150> stores<00:04:04.900> don't

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
generally cheaper online stores don't

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.539 
generally cheaper online stores don't
have<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.440> overhead<00:04:05.890> cost<00:04:06.220> of<00:04:06.489> a

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
have the overhead cost of a

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.640 
have the overhead cost of a
brick-and-mortar<00:04:06.820> store<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.870> I'm<00:04:08.470> not

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
brick-and-mortar store and I'm not

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.080 
brick-and-mortar store and I'm not
saying<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.040> online<00:04:09.280> retailers<00:04:09.820> don't<00:04:09.970> have

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
saying that online retailers don't have

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.820 
saying that online retailers don't have
their<00:04:10.209> own<00:04:10.269> unique<00:04:10.510> challenges<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.140> they

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
their own unique challenges and they

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.960 
their own unique challenges and they
certainly<00:04:11.950> have<00:04:12.220> different<00:04:12.670> kinds<00:04:12.910> of

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
certainly have different kinds of

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.479 
certainly have different kinds of
expenses<00:04:13.570> but<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.320> think<00:04:14.680> it's<00:04:14.860> generally

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
expenses but I think it's generally

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.979 
expenses but I think it's generally
understood<00:04:15.519> that<00:04:16.209> relatively<00:04:16.660> speaking

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
understood that relatively speaking

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.890 
understood that relatively speaking
they're<00:04:17.859> less<00:04:18.729> expensive<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.330> run<00:04:19.510> now<00:04:19.660> if

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
they're less expensive to run now if

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.870 
they're less expensive to run now if
you're<00:04:20.049> an<00:04:20.140> online<00:04:20.260> retailer<00:04:20.919> certainly<00:04:21.760> feel

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
you're an online retailer certainly feel

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.089 
you're an online retailer certainly feel

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.860 
free to comment or send a video let me
know<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.520> I'm<00:04:24.610> quite<00:04:25.060> wrong<00:04:25.300> about<00:04:25.450> that<00:04:25.690> but

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
know that I'm quite wrong about that but

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.120 
know that I'm quite wrong about that but
that's<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.080> sense<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.530> have

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
that's the sense that I have

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.130 
that's the sense that I have
then<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.460> also<00:04:27.640> have<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> matter<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.300> selection

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
then you also have a matter of selection

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.280 
then you also have a matter of selection
when<00:04:30.040> your<00:04:30.250> potential<00:04:30.700> shopping<00:04:31.690> audience<00:04:32.080> is

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
when your potential shopping audience is

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.060 
when your potential shopping audience is
an<00:04:33.010> entire<00:04:33.580> country<00:04:34.000> or<00:04:34.450> continent<00:04:34.870> or<00:04:35.440> the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
an entire country or continent or the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.280 
an entire country or continent or the
world<00:04:36.310> then<00:04:36.790> you<00:04:37.000> can<00:04:37.210> afford<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.020> little

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
world then you can afford to be a little

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.260 
world then you can afford to be a little
more<00:04:38.410> risky<00:04:38.830> with<00:04:38.980> your<00:04:39.100> stock<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.670> having<00:04:40.180> a

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
more risky with your stock and having a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.630 
more risky with your stock and having a
greater<00:04:40.570> variety<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:41.260> options<00:04:41.830> beyond<00:04:42.220> maybe

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
greater variety of options beyond maybe

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.730 
greater variety of options beyond maybe
what<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.000> local<00:04:43.480> game<00:04:43.690> store<00:04:43.720> can<00:04:44.230> cater<00:04:44.440> to

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
what a local game store can cater to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.070 
what a local game store can cater to
when<00:04:45.430> there's<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.700> limited<00:04:46.000> pool<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.270> consumers

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
when there's a limited pool of consumers

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.600 
when there's a limited pool of consumers
now<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.010> said<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.250> still<00:04:48.430> have<00:04:48.520> the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
now that said you still have the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.220 
now that said you still have the
challenge<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.150> knowing<00:04:49.390> exactly<00:04:49.480> how<00:04:50.050> much

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
challenge of knowing exactly how much

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.290 
challenge of knowing exactly how much
left<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.860> order<00:04:51.070> of<00:04:51.280> each<00:04:51.400> kind<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.820> game<00:04:52.000> but

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
left the order of each kind of game but

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.630 
left the order of each kind of game but
that<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:53.170> think<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.650> certainly<00:04:54.040> one<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.490> the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
that I think is certainly one of the

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.490 
that I think is certainly one of the
benefits<00:04:55.000> having<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.510> bigger<00:04:55.930> selection

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
benefits having that bigger selection

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.070 
benefits having that bigger selection
also<00:04:56.890> there's<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.430> convenience<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:58.900> can

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
also there's the convenience and I can

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.260 
also there's the convenience and I can
sit<00:04:59.530> at<00:04:59.620> home<00:04:59.650> and<00:04:59.860> I<00:05:00.340> can<00:05:00.670> even<00:05:00.850> sit<00:05:00.970> out<00:05:01.060> here

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
sit at home and I can even sit out here

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.910 
sit at home and I can even sit out here
with<00:05:01.330> my<00:05:01.540> laptop<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.020> do<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.410> couple<00:05:02.740> clicks

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
with my laptop and do a couple clicks

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.560 
with my laptop and do a couple clicks
and<00:05:03.160> that's<00:05:03.430> suddenly<00:05:03.760> a<00:05:03.880> games<00:05:04.150> on<00:05:04.330> its<00:05:04.450> way

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
and that's suddenly a games on its way

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.480 
and that's suddenly a games on its way
to<00:05:04.630> me<00:05:04.810> perhaps<00:05:05.290> even<00:05:05.710> with<00:05:05.830> free<00:05:06.070> shipping

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
to me perhaps even with free shipping

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.070 
to me perhaps even with free shipping
but<00:05:06.850> then<00:05:07.030> there's<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.360> loss<00:05:07.660> of<00:05:07.900> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
but then there's that loss of the
