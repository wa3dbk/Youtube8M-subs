00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.639 

hopefully<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.840> hand<00:00:59.050> for<00:00:59.260> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.920 

the<00:01:01.980> staples<00:01:02.489> had<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.879> tight<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.570> should<00:01:03.809> be

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the staples had to tight you should be

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.219 
the staples had to tight you should be
able<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> work<00:01:04.409> full<00:01:05.369> bar<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.880> underneath<00:01:06.420> then

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
able to work full bar in underneath then

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.310 
able to work full bar in underneath then
gently<00:01:08.190> just<00:01:08.640> work<00:01:08.940> it<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.140> can

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
gently just work it up like that you can

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520 
gently just work it up like that you can
see<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> edges<00:01:11.040> come<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:13.259> then<00:01:13.380> just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
see the edges come up here and then just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
see the edges come up here and then just
basically<00:01:14.450> work<00:01:15.450> round<00:01:15.780> bit<00:01:17.030> get<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.180> Kobus

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
basically work round bit get in Kobus

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.830 
basically work round bit get in Kobus
going<00:01:19.020> inside<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.700> gently<00:01:21.390> work

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
going inside and then just gently work

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.609 
going inside and then just gently work
with<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.110> wall<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.460> next<00:01:23.640> staple<00:01:27.619> sometimes

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
with a wall or the next staple sometimes

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
with a wall or the next staple sometimes
you're<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> break<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.600> find<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you're going to break this and find a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.889 
you're going to break this and find a
boy<00:01:31.820> if<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.940> start<00:01:33.180> getting<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.450> break<00:01:33.660> like

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
boy if you start getting a break like

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.510 
boy if you start getting a break like
that<00:01:33.929> then<00:01:34.289> it's<00:01:34.440> often<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.920> starting<00:01:35.399> on

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that then it's often like starting on

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:56.620 
that then it's often like starting on
the<00:01:35.640> other<00:01:35.759> side

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.380 

so<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:59.039> staples<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.670> detached<00:02:00.060> there

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so now the staples have detached there

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.200 
so now the staples have detached there
this<00:02:00.570> one's<00:02:00.810> still<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.289> top<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.740> wood

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
this one's still in the top of the wood

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.160 
this one's still in the top of the wood
and<00:02:03.229> should<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.770> working<00:02:05.280> our<00:02:05.429> food<00:02:06.140> okay

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and should be just working our food okay

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
and should be just working our food okay
now<00:02:08.129> sometimes<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.759> staples<00:02:09.149> downside

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
now sometimes you have staples downside

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.470 
now sometimes you have staples downside
this<00:02:09.750> boulders<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.269> work

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
this boulders and so you can just work

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.640 
this boulders and so you can just work
your<00:02:12.690> way<00:02:12.840> around<00:02:12.959> side<00:02:14.569> is<00:02:15.569> ten<00:02:15.870> fleet<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.470> you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
your way around side is ten fleet as you

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.259 
your way around side is ten fleet as you
get<00:02:16.769> closer<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:18.260> staple<00:02:20.150> end<00:02:21.150> up

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
get closer to this staple end up

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:38.870 
get closer to this staple end up
snapping<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.870> wood<00:02:25.940> corner<00:02:35.120> lastly<00:02:37.880> slowly

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
snapping the wood corner lastly slowly
