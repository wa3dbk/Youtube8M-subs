of<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> designer<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.650> base<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.520> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
of the designer of the base for this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
of the designer of the base for this
particular<00:00:32.790> base<00:00:33.390> design<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.380> that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
particular base design you can see that
