00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
there's nothing but the more to protect

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.229 
there's nothing but the more to protect
me<00:02:35.099> out<00:02:35.220> personally<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.609> so<00:02:35.790> I'm<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
me out personally I so I'm just going to

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.449 
me out personally I so I'm just going to
Fleur<00:02:37.019> on<00:02:37.049> my<00:02:37.230> trip<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.620> take<00:02:37.769> out<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.100> mortar

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
Fleur on my trip to take out that mortar

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.150 
Fleur on my trip to take out that mortar
and<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.569> free<00:02:39.810> outpost<00:02:40.200> as<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.829> sniper

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and then go free outpost as that sniper

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.640 
and then go free outpost as that sniper
tower<00:02:41.720> cannot<00:02:42.720> actually<00:02:42.930> reach<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.530> outpost

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
tower cannot actually reach the outpost

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.069 
tower cannot actually reach the outpost
I<00:02:44.220> finally<00:02:44.819> figured<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:45.299> out<00:02:45.450> took<00:02:45.930> me

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
I finally figured that one out took me

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.789 
I finally figured that one out took me
long<00:02:46.230> enough<00:02:46.260> okay<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:48.239> yeah<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.650> see

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
long enough okay so yeah you can see

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.050 
long enough okay so yeah you can see
that<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:50.069> sniper<00:02:50.310> Taylor<00:02:50.579> isn't<00:02:50.819> actually

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
that the sniper Taylor isn't actually

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.599 
that the sniper Taylor isn't actually
taking<00:02:51.630> care<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.049> outpost<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:53.400> why

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
taking care of the outpost that's why

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.830 
taking care of the outpost that's why
you<00:02:53.670> need<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:54.090> bit<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.329> setup<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:55.079> oil<00:02:55.680> stuff

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
you need a bit of setup for oil stuff

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:10.149 
you need a bit of setup for oil stuff
there<00:02:57.840> we<00:02:57.959> go<00:02:58.139> we<00:02:59.069> won<00:02:59.310> again

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.580 

so<00:03:11.159> here's<00:03:11.459> how<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.730> make<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.360> good<00:03:12.780> resource

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
so here's how you make a good resource

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.420 
so here's how you make a good resource
base<00:03:13.890> outpost<00:03:14.989> always<00:03:15.989> put<00:03:16.260> your<00:03:16.500> saw<00:03:17.159> mills

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
base outpost always put your saw mills

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.530 
base outpost always put your saw mills
or<00:03:17.670> quarry's<00:03:18.569> up<00:03:18.810> front<00:03:19.140> as<00:03:19.319> they<00:03:19.890> are<00:03:20.540> pretty

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
or quarry's up front as they are pretty

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.229 
or quarry's up front as they are pretty
much<00:03:21.689> useless<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.409> you<00:03:23.370> they're<00:03:23.909> not<00:03:24.030> going<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
much useless to you they're not going to

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.330 
much useless to you they're not going to
defend<00:03:24.569> your<00:03:24.659> village<00:03:24.719> free<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.379> mean<00:03:25.890> your

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
defend your village free I mean your

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.089 
defend your village free I mean your
island<00:03:26.849> fee<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.269> put<00:03:28.260> your<00:03:28.500> mortars<00:03:28.920> and

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
island fee and put your mortars and

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.289 
island fee and put your mortars and
rocket<00:03:29.549> launches<00:03:29.959> behind<00:03:30.959> your<00:03:31.439> outpost<00:03:31.799> as

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
rocket launches behind your outpost as

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.110 
rocket launches behind your outpost as
they<00:03:33.299> have<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.049> blind<00:03:34.319> spot<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.879> they<00:03:35.879> deal

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
they have a blind spot and they deal

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.809 
they have a blind spot and they deal
major<00:03:36.359> area<00:03:37.290> splash<00:03:37.590> damage<00:03:37.859> if<00:03:38.310> they<00:03:38.609> caught

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
major area splash damage if they caught

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.610 
major area splash damage if they caught
I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.629> that's<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:39.989> they<00:03:40.109> call<00:03:40.349> it<00:03:40.469> in

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
I think that that's what they call it in

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.640 
I think that that's what they call it in
boom<00:03:40.980> beach<00:03:41.129> I'm<00:03:41.430> not<00:03:41.579> sure<00:03:41.639> I<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.840> I'm<00:03:43.349> just

boom beach I'm not sure I you I'm just
way<00:03:43.920> too<00:03:43.980> used<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> plan<00:03:44.639> clash<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.530> there<00:03:47.129> put

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
way too used to plan clash so there put

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.289 
way too used to plan clash so there put
all<00:03:47.849> your<00:03:47.879> area<00:03:48.629> splash<00:03:49.019> thingy<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.150> back

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
all your area splash thingy in the back

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.300 
all your area splash thingy in the back
behind<00:03:51.659> you<00:03:51.900> tell<00:03:52.489> outposts<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.669> bad<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:55.310> put

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
behind you tell outposts I bad and put

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.899 
behind you tell outposts I bad and put
your<00:03:56.430> sniper<00:03:56.700> towers<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:57.930> front<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.260> the

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
your sniper towers just in front of the

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.809 
your sniper towers just in front of the
outpost<00:03:59.909> or<00:04:00.349> next<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.439> it<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:01.889> not<00:04:02.310> behind<00:04:02.579> it

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
outpost or next to it but not behind it

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.409 
outpost or next to it but not behind it
because<00:04:02.939> that<00:04:03.659> won't<00:04:03.780> cover<00:04:04.019> enough<00:04:04.349> land<00:04:04.620> and

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
because that won't cover enough land and

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.830 
because that won't cover enough land and
put<00:04:06.419> your<00:04:06.540> machine<00:04:06.840> guns<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.290> your<00:04:08.840> flame

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
put your machine guns and your flame

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.729 
put your machine guns and your flame
throwers<00:04:10.290> or<00:04:10.739> your<00:04:11.250> cannons<00:04:11.700> up<00:04:12.000> front<00:04:12.739> where

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
throwers or your cannons up front where

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.060 
throwers or your cannons up front where
they<00:04:13.859> should<00:04:14.099> be<00:04:14.299> taking<00:04:15.299> care<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.510> your

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
they should be taking care of your

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.319 
they should be taking care of your
sawmills<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.900> protecting<00:04:18.900> your<00:04:19.380> other<00:04:19.560> stuff

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
sawmills and protecting your other stuff

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.240 
sawmills and protecting your other stuff
so<00:04:21.329> there<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.659> go<00:04:21.830> resource<00:04:22.830> base<00:04:23.010> one

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
so there you go resource base one

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.710 
so there you go resource base one
completed<00:04:25.669> now<00:04:26.669> I'll<00:04:26.820> see<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.240> second<00:04:27.630> one

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.159 

that<00:04:30.720> was<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.990> pretty<00:04:31.260> good<00:04:31.470> one<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:32.840> now<00:04:33.840> my

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
that was a pretty good one and now my

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.430 
that was a pretty good one and now my
third<00:04:34.440> one<00:04:34.940> so<00:04:35.940> as<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.270> can<00:04:36.360> see<00:04:36.570> try<00:04:37.169> not<00:04:37.289> to

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
third one so as you can see try not to

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.040 
third one so as you can see try not to
put<00:04:37.889> them<00:04:38.039> two<00:04:38.580> together<00:04:38.789> as<00:04:39.150> they<00:04:39.780> can<00:04:39.930> be

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
put them two together as they can be

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.029 
put them two together as they can be
double<00:04:40.380> bummed<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.280> put<00:04:41.729> one<00:04:42.030> gap<00:04:42.419> 1<00:04:43.169> square

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
double bummed so put one gap 1 square

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.909 
double bummed so put one gap 1 square
gap<00:04:44.280> between<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.849> them<00:04:45.720> just<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.770> they

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
gap between of them just so that they

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.920 
gap between of them just so that they
can't<00:04:47.130> be<00:04:47.250> area<00:04:47.550> bombed<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.090> get<00:04:48.599> more<00:04:48.780> points

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
can't be area bombed and get more points

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:57.040 
can't be area bombed and get more points
out<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.699> so<00:04:50.699> that's<00:04:50.880> my<00:04:51.150> other<00:04:51.449> base<00:04:51.720> done

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.580 

my

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
my

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.020 
my
third<00:05:00.250> or<00:05:00.430> fourth<00:05:00.760> base<00:05:01.320> now<00:05:02.790> this<00:05:03.790> is<00:05:03.850> a

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
third or fourth base now this is a

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.610 
third or fourth base now this is a
pretty<00:05:04.270> interesting<00:05:04.510> setup<00:05:04.900> rock<00:05:05.380> launched

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
pretty interesting setup rock launched

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.740 
pretty interesting setup rock launched
in<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.860> back<00:05:06.040> in<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.370> motor<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.820> then<00:05:07.510> two

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
in the back in the motor and then two
