that<00:00:09.660> one<00:00:09.839> is<00:00:10.049> a<00:00:10.080> lemon<00:00:10.740> tree<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.929> we've<00:00:12.929> got

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
that one is a lemon tree and we've got

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.799 
that one is a lemon tree and we've got
far<00:00:13.410> too<00:00:13.620> many<00:00:13.710> lemons<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.339> I<00:00:14.370> thought<00:00:14.780> why<00:00:15.780> not

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
far too many lemons so I thought why not

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.850 
far too many lemons so I thought why not
let's<00:00:16.170> graph<00:00:16.410> some<00:00:17.840> oranges<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.410> what

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
let's graph some oranges on it so what

an<00:00:22.170> L<00:00:22.290> shape<00:00:22.560> cut<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:23.490> I've<00:00:23.580> peeled<00:00:23.940> this

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
an L shape cut and I've peeled this

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.310 
an L shape cut and I've peeled this
layer<00:00:24.450> back<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.290> all<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.100> did<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:27.320> once

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
layer back there and all I did was once

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.080 
layer back there and all I did was once
I<00:00:28.440> peeled<00:00:28.770> it<00:00:28.920> back<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.370> just<00:00:29.550> slipped<00:00:29.790> this

I peeled it back I just slipped this
tiny<00:00:30.870> little<00:00:31.160> orange<00:00:32.160> stem<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.769> I<00:00:34.769> put<00:00:35.129> it

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
tiny little orange stem in and I put it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.369 
tiny little orange stem in and I put it
in<00:00:35.339> and<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.640> bound<00:00:36.089> it<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.359> tightly<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:37.140> been

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
in and I bound it up tightly it's been

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.459 
in and I bound it up tightly it's been
about<00:00:37.620> 4<00:00:38.010> weeks<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.469> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
about 4 weeks now and as you can see you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.410 
about 4 weeks now and as you can see you
can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.070> nice<00:00:41.339> healthy<00:00:41.760> cambium

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
can see all that nice healthy cambium

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.689 
can see all that nice healthy cambium
actually<00:00:43.170> pushing<00:00:43.559> itself<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:44.160> through<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
actually pushing itself out through the

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.930 
actually pushing itself out through the
cracks<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.690> that's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.170> perfect<00:00:46.829> graft<00:00:47.100> right

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
cracks so that's a perfect graft right

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.479 
cracks so that's a perfect graft right
there<00:00:48.440> show<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.499> another<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.249> one's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
there show you another one this one's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
there show you another one this one's
not<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.940> flash<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.859> there's<00:00:53.069> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
not as flash you can see there's a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.540 
not as flash you can see there's a
little<00:00:53.339> bit<00:00:53.429> of<00:00:53.460> SAP<00:00:54.109> coming<00:00:55.109> out<00:00:55.289> there<00:00:55.550> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
little bit of SAP coming out there it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.380 
little bit of SAP coming out there it's
not<00:00:56.730> too<00:00:56.879> important<00:00:57.359> but<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.589> see<00:00:58.649> I

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
not too important but as you can see I

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.500 
not too important but as you can see I
did<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.479> l-shape<00:01:00.929> cut<00:01:01.589> there<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.300> across

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
did an l-shape cut there up and across

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.380 
did an l-shape cut there up and across
peeled<00:01:04.440> it<00:01:04.590> back<00:01:04.620> slip<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.090> these

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
peeled it back slip that in and these

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
peeled it back slip that in and these
have<00:01:06.630> survived<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.620> can<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.190> buds

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
have survived you can see the two buds

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.750 
have survived you can see the two buds
there<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.810> they've<00:01:10.170> come<00:01:10.440> out<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.800> all<00:01:11.730> I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

did today was just cut it off I'm just
letting<00:01:14.010> these<00:01:14.400> um<00:01:14.810> these<00:01:15.810> cuts<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.770> air<00:01:17.190> out

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
letting these um these cuts just air out

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
letting these um these cuts just air out
a<00:01:17.370> little<00:01:17.610> bit<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.300> little<00:01:18.660> bit<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
a little bit there was a little bit of a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.790 
a little bit there was a little bit of a
fungus<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> did<00:01:20.280> was<00:01:20.580> um<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:22.380> let<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
fungus so all I did was um just let it

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.170 
fungus so all I did was um just let it
air<00:01:22.980> out<00:01:23.010> for<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> few<00:01:23.490> hours<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.940> now<00:01:24.090> I'm

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
air out for a few hours and now I'm

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
air out for a few hours and now I'm
going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.540> put<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.870> graft<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> seal

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
going to just put the graft and seal

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
going to just put the graft and seal
over<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> these<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.790> fine<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:27.870> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
over it and these are fine to go all I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.190 
over it and these are fine to go all I
did<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.350> topped<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.010> one<00:01:29.190> clean<00:01:29.670> off<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
did was topped this one clean off and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
did was topped this one clean off and
that<00:01:31.200> will<00:01:31.290> force<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> SAP<00:01:31.920> through<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.430> out

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that will force the SAP through here out

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.110 
that will force the SAP through here out
the<00:01:33.390> buds<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.950> need<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> cut<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.580> far<00:01:35.910> away

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
the buds you need to cut it far away

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.660 
the buds you need to cut it far away
from<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.510> because<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.960> happens<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.670> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
from here because what happens is the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
from here because what happens is the
SAP<00:01:38.910> can't<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.750> stop<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> needs<00:01:40.440> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
SAP can't just stop here it needs to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.370 
SAP can't just stop here it needs to
keep<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.920> moving<00:01:41.070> past<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.900> graft<00:01:42.900> in<00:01:43.170> order

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
keep on moving past that graft in order

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.120 
keep on moving past that graft in order
to<00:01:43.530> keep<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.830> alive

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to keep it alive

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.420 
to keep it alive
I<00:01:44.340> found<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.150> whenever<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:45.510> cut<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:45.750> there

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
I found that whenever I cut right there

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
I found that whenever I cut right there
the<00:01:47.430> SAP<00:01:47.640> didn't<00:01:47.910> actually<00:01:48.030> reach<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.450> top<00:01:48.810> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the SAP didn't actually reach the top so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.710 
the SAP didn't actually reach the top so
this<00:01:49.620> is<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.950> straw<00:01:50.250> effect<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.880> longer<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
this is the straw effect the longer the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.380 
this is the straw effect the longer the
stem<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.460> SAP<00:01:53.760> gets<00:01:53.940> pulled<00:01:54.300> up

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
stem up here the more SAP gets pulled up

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.060 
stem up here the more SAP gets pulled up
through<00:01:54.720> there<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.080> you'll<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:55.800> good

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
through there and you'll get a very good

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
through there and you'll get a very good
healthy<00:01:56.550> graft<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.150> then<00:01:57.540> afterwards<00:01:57.960> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
healthy graft and then afterwards you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.600 
healthy graft and then afterwards you
can<00:01:58.170> clean<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:58.830> cut<00:01:58.980> it<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.340> it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
can clean it up and cut it there it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.060 
can clean it up and cut it there it
doesn't<00:01:59.910> matter<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:01.470> one<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.890> because

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
doesn't matter this one here because

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.100 
doesn't matter this one here because
it's<00:02:02.400> Midway<00:02:02.760> up<00:02:02.910> with<00:02:03.060> large<00:02:03.270> stem<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.870> did

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's Midway up with large stem all I did

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
it's Midway up with large stem all I did
was<00:02:04.230> I<00:02:04.470> sink<00:02:05.190> chewed<00:02:05.370> it<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.580> here<00:02:05.910> so<00:02:06.150> it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
was I sink chewed it up here so it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.940 
was I sink chewed it up here so it

forces all the SAP to reside around this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.410 
forces all the SAP to reside around this
area

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.220 
2013 and he'll fare the graft is there
to<00:04:14.239> prove<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.950> yes<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.340> is<00:04:16.459> graft

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
to prove that yes that is graft

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.910 
to prove that yes that is graft
and<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.770> graft<00:04:19.040> is<00:04:19.340> here<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.300> prove<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.890> a

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
and the graft is here to prove it is a

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.830 
and the graft is here to prove it is a
graft<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:24.440> can<00:04:24.710> see<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:26.180> orange<00:04:26.450> has

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
graft and you can see the orange has

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.940 
graft and you can see the orange has
done<00:04:27.230> magnificently<00:04:27.620> well<00:04:29.590> I'm<00:04:30.590> not<00:04:30.800> sure

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
done magnificently well I'm not sure

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.740 
done magnificently well I'm not sure
what<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.220> call<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:31.550> plant<00:04:31.820> I'll<00:04:32.150> call<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:32.630> my

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
what to call this plant I'll call it my

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.590 
what to call this plant I'll call it my
fruit<00:04:33.020> salad<00:04:33.230> plant<00:04:33.820> because<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:35.180> got<00:04:35.390> far

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
fruit salad plant because it's got far

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.460 
fruit salad plant because it's got far
too<00:04:35.780> many<00:04:36.100> species<00:04:37.100> of<00:04:37.430> citrus<00:04:37.790> on<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.470> to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
too many species of citrus on it to

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.640 
too many species of citrus on it to
really<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.830> called<00:04:40.960> purely<00:04:41.960> an<00:04:42.080> orange<00:04:42.380> tree

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
really be called purely an orange tree

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.770 
really be called purely an orange tree
or<00:04:42.890> purely<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.340> kumquat<00:04:43.670> tree<00:04:43.910> or<00:04:44.390> purely

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770

the<00:04:48.770> SAP<00:04:48.980> goes<00:04:49.300> straight<00:04:50.300> straight<00:04:50.810> up<00:04:51.020> the

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
the SAP goes straight straight up the

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.770 
the SAP goes straight straight up the
trunk<00:04:51.710> there<00:04:51.950> so<00:04:52.280> not<00:04:52.910> too<00:04:53.060> much<00:04:53.210> action<00:04:53.450> there

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
trunk there so not too much action there

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.330 
trunk there so not too much action there
I'll<00:04:53.960> probably<00:04:54.080> try<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.530> go<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.100> little

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
I'll probably try and go to a little

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.010 
I'll probably try and go to a little
sink<00:04:55.550> show<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.910> area<00:04:56.240> there<00:04:56.390> just<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.750> force

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
sink show that area there just to force

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.920 
sink show that area there just to force
this<00:04:57.290> area<00:04:57.650> out<00:04:59.290> but<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:02.120> top<00:05:02.300> is<00:05:02.330> where<00:05:02.630> all

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
this area out but the top is where all

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.490 
this area out but the top is where all
the<00:05:03.050> action<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.500> and<00:05:05.020> just<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.200> way<00:05:06.320> it's

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
the action is and just the way it's

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.500 
the action is and just the way it's
headed<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:07.640> probably<00:05:08.060> going<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.210> fruit

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
headed it's probably going to fruit

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.620 
headed it's probably going to fruit
really<00:05:09.080> really<00:05:09.500> soon<00:05:09.970> you<00:05:10.970> can<00:05:11.090> see<00:05:11.240> how<00:05:11.420> heavy

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
really really soon you can see how heavy

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.140 
really really soon you can see how heavy
these<00:05:12.230> are<00:05:12.620> these<00:05:12.980> growths<00:05:13.280> have<00:05:13.550> become<00:05:13.880> and

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
these are these growths have become and

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.870 
these are these growths have become and
the<00:05:15.080> graphs<00:05:15.320> not<00:05:15.710> supporting<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.280> too<00:05:16.460> well<00:05:16.610> so

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
the graphs not supporting it too well so

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.820 
the graphs not supporting it too well so
I'm<00:05:17.360> going<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.660> probably<00:05:17.930> have<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.200> stake<00:05:18.620> it

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
I'm going to probably have to stake it

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.190 
I'm going to probably have to stake it
just<00:05:19.190> to<00:05:19.280> prevent<00:05:19.520> any<00:05:19.670> fat<00:05:20.660> birds<00:05:20.960> from

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
just to prevent any fat birds from

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.410 
just to prevent any fat birds from
landing<00:05:21.530> on<00:05:21.620> these<00:05:21.800> branches<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.460> breaking

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
landing on these branches and breaking

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.810 
landing on these branches and breaking
off<00:05:23.540> all<00:05:23.690> my<00:05:23.900> arm<00:05:24.110> all<00:05:24.830> my<00:05:25.010> work<00:05:25.250> over<00:05:25.610> these

off all my arm all my work over these

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.610 
off all my arm all my work over these
last<00:05:26.210> few<00:05:26.480> months<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:27.560> arm<00:05:28.540> yeah<00:05:29.600> very<00:05:30.320> proud

of perseverance does if you're unhappy
with<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.320> fruit<00:05:39.890> tree<00:05:40.190> and<00:05:40.430> it's<00:05:40.550> not<00:05:40.790> giving

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
with a fruit tree and it's not giving

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.420 
with a fruit tree and it's not giving
you<00:05:41.270> good<00:05:41.480> quality<00:05:41.870> fruit<00:05:42.200> don't<00:05:42.950> kill<00:05:43.250> it

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
you good quality fruit don't kill it

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.610 
you good quality fruit don't kill it
don't<00:05:43.640> chop<00:05:43.790> it<00:05:43.850> all<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.840> have<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:45.080> do<00:05:45.170> is<00:05:45.320> just

a<00:05:48.200> little<00:05:48.770> bit<00:05:48.950> of<00:05:49.010> grafting<00:05:49.720> takes<00:05:50.720> you<00:05:50.870> a

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
a little bit of grafting takes you a

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.760 
a little bit of grafting takes you a
long<00:05:51.050> way<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.880> yeah<00:05:53.230> hope<00:05:54.230> you've<00:05:54.410> enjoyed

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.650 
this grafting series and that's probably
going<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.590> be<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.860> last<00:05:58.150> update<00:05:59.150> on<00:05:59.390> the
