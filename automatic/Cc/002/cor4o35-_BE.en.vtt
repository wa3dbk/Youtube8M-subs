00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.750 

let's<00:00:00.359> say

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.030 

-<00:00:03.270> gee

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.799 

architecture

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.920 

of<00:00:12.809> GSM<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.700> we'll<00:00:14.849> look<00:00:14.940> into<00:00:15.090> the<00:00:15.299> protocols

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
of GSM so we'll look into the protocols

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.200 
of GSM so we'll look into the protocols
and<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.619> interfaces<00:00:17.070> between<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.730> different

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and the interfaces between the different

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.300 
and the interfaces between the different
network<00:00:19.110> elements<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.550> let's<00:00:21.150> start<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
network elements so let's start with the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.299 
network elements so let's start with the
MSC<00:00:23.849> which<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> brain<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:26.910> NSS<00:00:28.309> netbook

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
MSC which is a brain of of NSS netbook

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:36.639 
MSC which is a brain of of NSS netbook
subsystem<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.360> let<00:00:30.869> me<00:00:30.960> draw<00:00:31.230> an<00:00:31.529> MSC<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:34.880> MSC

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
subsystem so let me draw an MSC here MSC

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.620 
subsystem so let me draw an MSC here MSC
let<00:00:37.649> me<00:00:37.800> connect<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.579> another<00:00:38.850> MSC

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.870 

then<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.350> goes

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.610 

to<00:00:46.420> an<00:00:46.570> ISDN<00:00:47.350> network<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:49.600> MSC<00:00:50.230> as<00:00:50.320> we<00:00:50.470> all
