more hours let us set for about I would

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.809 
more hours let us set for about I would
say<00:03:07.200> give<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.769> good<00:03:08.299> three<00:03:09.299> hours<00:03:09.329> or<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.260> and

say give it a good three hours or so and

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:37.250 
say give it a good three hours or so and
then<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:12.269> could<00:03:12.540> start<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.109> remove<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.220> tape

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.320 

if<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.739> some<00:03:39.129> part<00:03:39.459> where<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:40.120> paint

if you have some part where the paint
bleed<00:03:40.690> through<00:03:40.930> then<00:03:41.560> just<00:03:41.830> basically<00:03:42.040> take

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
bleed through then just basically take

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.880
