00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
course you can and I remember when we

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.519 
course you can and I remember when we
played<00:00:26.490> bomb<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.210> think<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.410> like

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
played bomb if I think it got a bit like

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
played bomb if I think it got a bit like
that<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> end<00:00:30.119> result<00:00:30.449> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that and you see in the end result and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
that and you see in the end result and
we<00:00:31.410> had<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> meat<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.550> in

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
we had a little that a lot of meat in in

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.360 
we had a little that a lot of meat in in
in<00:00:33.260> Marbella<00:00:34.260> about<00:00:34.559> about<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.100> sort<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
in Marbella about about that sort of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
in Marbella about about that sort of
thing<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.840> relaxed<00:00:37.230> everyone

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
thing and I think that relaxed everyone

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
thing and I think that relaxed everyone
and<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.340> performed<00:00:38.760> into<00:00:39.030> into

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and you see now we performed into into

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
and you see now we performed into into
massive<00:00:39.870> game<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.260> hopefully<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> take

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
massive game so hopefully we can take

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.830 
massive game so hopefully we can take
that<00:00:41.160> approach<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.520> get<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.750> we

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
that approach to get and and do what we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.930 
that approach to get and and do what we
need<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.170> obviously<00:00:44.010> Wembley<00:00:44.550> isn't<00:00:44.789> Dean

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
need to do obviously Wembley isn't Dean

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
need to do obviously Wembley isn't Dean
court<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.510> anywhere<00:00:45.989> else<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.230> blowed<00:00:46.469> this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
twelve months ago so there's a big

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.080 
twelve months ago so there's a big
change<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.710> they<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:53.009> players<00:01:53.189> they

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
change and they have good players they

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.719

have<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.420> players<00:01:54.689> there's<00:01:54.930> been<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
have good players there's been a bit of

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.039 
have good players there's been a bit of
maybe<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.909> an<00:01:57.030> ill<00:01:57.270> feeling<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
maybe out an ill feeling or a bit of a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.389 
maybe out an ill feeling or a bit of a
bit<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> needle<00:01:58.710> coming<00:01:58.920> from<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> Norwich

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
bit of needle coming from the Norwich

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.039 
bit of needle coming from the Norwich
and<00:01:59.579> hasn't<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.270> think<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.450> they

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
and hasn't it because I think that they

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.840 
and hasn't it because I think that they
felt<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> bit<00:02:01.409> hard<00:02:01.590> done<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.979> with<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> result

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
felt a bit hard done to with the result

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
felt a bit hard done to with the result
Carol<00:02:03.360> rod<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:04.350> will<00:02:04.439> be

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
Carol rod is do you think there will be

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.469 
Carol rod is do you think there will be
that<00:02:04.710> edge<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.329> obviously<00:02:06.329> there

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that edge there that obviously there

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.880 
that edge there that obviously there
will<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.600> cuz<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> playoff<00:02:07.320> final<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:07.829> do

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
will be cuz it's a playoff final but do

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.690 
will be cuz it's a playoff final but do
you<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.069> there's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.340> bit<00:02:08.489> extra

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you think there's a little bit extra

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.660 
you think there's a little bit extra
cause<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.959> maybe<00:02:10.800> maybe<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.489> their

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
cause of that and maybe maybe on their

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.449 
cause of that and maybe maybe on their
on<00:02:11.849> there

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
on there

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.250 
on there
on<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.209> part<00:02:13.510> there's<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.900> little<00:02:14.110> bit

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
on that part there's a little bit

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.140 
on that part there's a little bit
actually<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.920> think<00:02:14.980> he'd<00:02:15.280> come<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.730> roam<00:02:15.940> say

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
actually I think he'd come and roam say

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.600 
actually I think he'd come and roam say
revenge<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:17.769> he's<00:02:17.920> after<00:02:18.129> after<00:02:18.879> game<00:02:20.610> chat

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
revenge and he's after after game chat
