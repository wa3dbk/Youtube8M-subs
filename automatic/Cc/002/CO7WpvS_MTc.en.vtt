like the old Pixar animation with the
like<00:00:28.550> it's<00:00:28.880> I<00:00:28.970> think<00:00:29.060> it's<00:00:29.360> got<00:00:29.480> an<00:00:29.570> attitude

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
like it's I think it's got an attitude

so<00:00:30.950> you<00:00:31.039> have<00:00:31.189> an<00:00:31.279> animation<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.970> actually

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
so you have an animation that actually

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.119 
so you have an animation that actually
helps<00:00:32.540> promote<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.900> cameras<00:00:33.260> motion<00:00:33.680> it's

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
helps promote the cameras motion it's

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.590 
helps promote the cameras motion it's
actually<00:00:34.400> step<00:00:34.579> motion<00:00:34.760> says<00:00:35.030> individual

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
actually step motion says individual

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.180 
actually step motion says individual
shots<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:36.140> mean<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.559> work<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:36.920> went<00:00:37.100> into

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
that was phenomenal it's a little bit of

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:40.540 
that was phenomenal it's a little bit of
a<00:00:39.440> different<00:00:39.680> approach<00:00:39.949> in<00:00:40.250> terms<00:00:40.430> of

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
a different approach in terms of

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
the idea is to learn from what they're

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.940 
the idea is to learn from what they're
doing<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.329> ensure<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.659> what<00:01:56.930> we<00:01:57.110> do<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.920> just

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
doing and ensure that what we do we just

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.310 
doing and ensure that what we do we just
do<00:01:58.250> better<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.850> that's<00:01:59.240> what<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.509> my<00:01:59.930> goal<00:02:00.140> is

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
do better and that's what I my goal is

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.200 
do better and that's what I my goal is
to<00:02:00.770> be<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.070> be<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.520> best<00:02:01.640> product<00:02:01.939> on<00:02:02.149> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
to be is to be the best product on the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.249 
to be is to be the best product on the
market<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:02.689> how<00:02:02.869> do<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.049> really

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
market so how do you really

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.039 
market so how do you really
differentiate<00:02:03.710> yourselves<00:02:04.520> for<00:02:05.180> us<00:02:05.329> clearly

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
differentiate yourselves for us clearly

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.919 
differentiate yourselves for us clearly
the<00:02:06.439> ease<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.799> use<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:08.119> fact<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.690> we<00:02:08.840> don't

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
the ease of use the fact that we don't

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.810 
the ease of use the fact that we don't
need<00:02:09.110> an<00:02:09.229> outer<00:02:09.350> casing

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
need an outer casing

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.270 
need an outer casing
the<00:02:11.180> fact<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.540> our<00:02:11.810> connectivity<00:02:12.590> elements

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the fact that our connectivity elements

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490 
the fact that our connectivity elements
are<00:02:13.490> very<00:02:13.790> mature<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.140> have<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
are very mature you know we have the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.620 
are very mature you know we have the
Android<00:02:15.860> application<00:02:16.490> have<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.270> iPhone

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
Android application have the iPhone

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.570 
Android application have the iPhone
application<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:18.290> have<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> iPad<00:02:19.010> application

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
application we have the iPad application

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.130 
application we have the iPad application
in<00:02:20.210> fact<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.540> we've<00:02:20.660> got<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:20.930> whole

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
in fact that we've got this whole

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.920 
in fact that we've got this whole
concept<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.890> pods<00:02:22.190> which<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.730> modular<00:02:23.270> we

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
concept of the pods which is modular we

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.210 
concept of the pods which is modular we
now<00:02:24.050> have<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.230> new<00:02:24.380> product<00:02:24.650> here<00:02:24.890> which<00:02:25.070> is

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
now have a new product here which is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.480 
now have a new product here which is
called<00:02:25.340> our<00:02:25.520> remote<00:02:25.850> pods<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.020> a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
called our remote pods so this is a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.380 
called our remote pods so this is a
different<00:02:28.490> part<00:02:28.610> when<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:28.910> pop<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.210> into

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
different part when you pop this into

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.900 
different part when you pop this into
the<00:02:29.510> back<00:02:29.660> here<00:02:29.870> close<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.350> up<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.730> have<00:02:31.880> a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
the back here close this up and I have a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.880 
the back here close this up and I have a
remote<00:02:32.150> control<00:02:32.210> me<00:02:32.660> right<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.770> can

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
remote control me right but this one can

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.430 
remote control me right but this one can
only<00:02:34.010> control<00:02:34.760> up<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.000> 8<00:02:35.210> cameras<00:02:35.660> with<00:02:35.930> GoPro

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
only control up to 8 cameras with GoPro

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.020 
only control up to 8 cameras with GoPro
it<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.740> actually<00:02:37.040> control<00:02:37.340> up<00:02:37.460> to<00:02:37.490> 50<00:02:37.880> that's

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
it can actually control up to 50 that's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.700 
it can actually control up to 50 that's
correct<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.960> know<00:02:39.050> we<00:02:39.170> chose<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.620> go

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
correct and so you know we chose to go

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.130 
correct and so you know we chose to go
with<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.970> technology<00:02:40.970> called<00:02:41.120> ZigBee<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:42.050> a

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
with a technology called ZigBee it's a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.960 
with a technology called ZigBee it's a
ZigBee<00:02:42.440> technology<00:02:42.980> which<00:02:43.610> allows<00:02:43.790> for

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
ZigBee technology which allows for

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.200 
ZigBee technology which allows for
better<00:02:44.630> compare<00:02:44.990> consumption<00:02:45.670> Wi-Fi<00:02:46.670> draws<00:02:47.180> a

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
better compare consumption Wi-Fi draws a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.780 
better compare consumption Wi-Fi draws a
lot<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.630> power<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.410> destroys<00:02:49.040> little<00:02:49.610> node

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
lot of power this destroys little node

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.150 
lot of power this destroys little node
power<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.600> it's<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.050> bit<00:02:51.230> severe<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.010> for

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
power so it's it's a bit severe so for

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.460 
power so it's it's a bit severe so for
us<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.150> when<00:02:53.330> we<00:02:53.510> look<00:02:53.630> at<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.900> what<00:02:54.350> is

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
us you know when we look at it what is

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.250 
us you know when we look at it what is
the<00:02:54.650> we're<00:02:55.460> trying<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.700> appeal<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.150> more<00:02:56.360> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
the we're trying to appeal to more the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.680 
the we're trying to appeal to more the
the<00:02:57.800> mass<00:02:58.220> is<00:02:58.430> not<00:02:58.520> not<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.120> for<00:02:59.240> professional

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
the mass is not not not for professional

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.260 
the mass is not not not for professional
community<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.470> for<00:03:00.620> us<00:03:00.770> 8<00:03:01.010> cameras<00:03:01.580> that's<00:03:02.150> a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
community so for us 8 cameras that's a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.210 
community so for us 8 cameras that's a
good<00:03:02.420> number<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.350> terms<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.650> marketing<00:03:04.040> so

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
good number but in terms of marketing so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.680 
good number but in terms of marketing so
if<00:03:04.340> you're<00:03:04.520> sitting<00:03:04.760> there<00:03:04.880> you're<00:03:05.360> you're

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
if you're sitting there you're you're

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.690 
if you're sitting there you're you're
walking<00:03:06.050> into<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.350> store<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:06.800> you're<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.550> know

walking into a store and you're you know

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.570 
walking into a store and you're you know
the<00:03:07.730> household<00:03:08.300> name<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.900> GoPro<00:03:09.800> you're<00:03:10.430> going

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
to walk right over the shelf you're

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.300 
to walk right over the shelf you're
going<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.870> want<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.020> pick<00:03:12.170> up<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.410> go<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:12.800> GoPro

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.480 
so on the Shelf if you're sitting side
by<00:03:15.350> side<00:03:15.650> how<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.070> differentiate

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
by side how do you differentiate

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.640 
by side how do you differentiate
yourself<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.180> make<00:03:17.420> someone<00:03:17.810> want<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.470> pick

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
up because the price points are pretty

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.150 
up because the price points are pretty
much<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.240> same<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.750> key<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.320> putting<00:03:21.920> this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
much the same the key is putting this

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.310 
much the same the key is putting this
