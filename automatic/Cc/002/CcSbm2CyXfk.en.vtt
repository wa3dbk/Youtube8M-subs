00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
makes sense to pay very much attention

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.070 
makes sense to pay very much attention
to<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.619> fundamentals<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.300> currency<00:00:24.840> in

they're spending and that's probably a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.720 
they're spending and that's probably a
pretty<00:00:38.969> good<00:00:39.120> country<00:00:40.370> country's<00:00:41.370> currency

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
pretty good country country's currency

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.959 
pretty good country country's currency
to<00:00:42.059> own<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.649> country<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.309> spending<00:00:44.820> more

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to own if the country is spending more

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
to own if the country is spending more
money<00:00:45.030> than<00:00:45.329> they're<00:00:45.510> bringing<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.020> then

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860

that's<00:00:47.579> probably<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> pretty<00:00:48.539> good<00:00:48.660> country

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
that's probably a pretty good country

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.709 
that's probably a pretty good country
too<00:00:49.410> short<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.520> here's<00:00:51.030> how<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
too short but here's how you make the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.619 
too short but here's how you make the
most<00:00:51.870> money<00:00:52.340> all<00:00:53.340> countries<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.149> through<00:00:54.390> long

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
most money all countries go through long

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.700 
most money all countries go through long
cycles<00:00:55.260> maybe<00:00:56.129> five<00:00:56.670> years<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:57.300> ten<00:00:57.570> years

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
cycles maybe five years or ten years

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.790 
cycles maybe five years or ten years
their<00:00:58.710> periods<00:00:59.190> when<00:00:59.579> when<00:01:00.649> they<00:01:01.649> are

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
their periods when when they are

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.869 
their periods when when they are
spending<00:01:02.129> more<00:01:02.370> money<00:01:02.430> than<00:01:02.699> they're

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
spending more money than they're

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
spending more money than they're
bringing<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.359> their<00:01:03.539> currency<00:01:04.019> weakens

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
bringing in their currency weakens

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
bringing in their currency weakens
weakens<00:01:04.769> weakens<00:01:05.159> sort<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> US

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
weakens weakens sort of like the US

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.490 
weakens weakens sort of like the US
dollar<00:01:06.119> today<00:01:06.450> weakens<00:01:07.049> weakens<00:01:07.409> weakens<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
dollar today weakens weakens weakens and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
dollar today weakens weakens weakens and
gradually<00:01:10.500> though<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.760> currency<00:01:12.330> gets

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
gradually though as the currency gets

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.640 
gradually though as the currency gets
weaker<00:01:13.020> exports<00:01:13.950> pick<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.810> they<00:01:15.810> begin<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
weaker exports pick up they begin to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
weaker exports pick up they begin to
bring<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.189> more<00:01:17.549> cash<00:01:17.880> than<00:01:18.330> they're<00:01:18.720> spending

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
bring in more cash than they're spending

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.280 
bring in more cash than they're spending
and<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> point<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.600> becomes<00:01:21.960> very

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and at that point it becomes very

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.410 
and at that point it becomes very
attractive<00:01:22.439> because<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> flip<00:01:24.119> in

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
attractive because you have a flip in

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.429 
attractive because you have a flip in
there<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
there and you you can then have a

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.700 
there and you you can then have a
significant<00:01:28.439> rapid<00:01:28.799> movement<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.820> currency

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
significant rapid movement in a currency

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.350 
significant rapid movement in a currency
an<00:01:31.710> example<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.270> US<00:01:33.600> dollar<00:01:33.869> since<00:01:34.200> August

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
an example is the US dollar since August

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
an example is the US dollar since August
and<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.720> US<00:01:36.990> dollar<00:01:37.290> peaked<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:38.040> about<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and the US dollar peaked at about a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.649 
and the US dollar peaked at about a
hundred<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.820> fifty<00:01:39.150> nine<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> euro<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
hundred and fifty nine to the euro and

hundred and fifty nine to the euro and
bottom<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> hundred<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.979> thirty<00:01:44.579> two

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
bottom in about a hundred and thirty two

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.510 
bottom in about a hundred and thirty two
the<00:01:45.090> euro<00:01:45.390> those<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.869> approximate<00:01:46.320> numbers

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
the euro those are approximate numbers

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.109 
the euro those are approximate numbers
from<00:01:47.520> August<00:01:48.299> until<00:01:48.509> today<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.909> that's<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
from August until today and that's a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990 
from August until today and that's a
tremendous<00:01:52.079> move<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> big<00:01:53.700> thing<00:01:53.970> here

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
tremendous move and the big thing here

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.539 
tremendous move and the big thing here
is<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.470> nothing<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.159> stock

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
is that is nothing to do with stock

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.160 
is that is nothing to do with stock
market<00:01:56.939> there's<00:01:57.299> nothing<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
market there's nothing to do with the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.709 
market there's nothing to do with the
real<00:01:58.320> estate<00:01:58.350> market<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> you've<00:02:00.270> picked<00:02:00.509> an

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
real estate market so you've picked an

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
real estate market so you've picked an
asset<00:02:01.110> class<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.009> trades<00:02:02.729> for

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
asset class now that trades for

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
asset class now that trades for
completely<00:02:03.329> different<00:02:03.450> reasons<00:02:03.780> than<00:02:04.560> real

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
completely different reasons than real

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.999 
completely different reasons than real
estate<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.579> stock<00:02:05.969> that's<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.930> big<00:02:07.259> deal<00:02:07.590> today

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
estate or stock that's a big deal today

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.520 
estate or stock that's a big deal today
because<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.149> all<00:02:09.270> likelihood<00:02:09.720> real<00:02:10.229> estate

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
because in all likelihood real estate

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.920 
because in all likelihood real estate
prices<00:02:10.770> are<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> continue
