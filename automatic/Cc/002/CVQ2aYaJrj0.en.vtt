there are bluebirds and this law

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.610 
there are bluebirds and this law
basically<00:00:43.790> just<00:00:44.000> adds<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.570> more<00:00:44.810> mobs<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.500> it

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
basically just adds a more mobs to it

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.200 
basically just adds a more mobs to it
game<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.190> they<00:00:46.430> drop<00:00:47.050> angry<00:00:48.050> feathers<00:00:49.210> and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
then the color of what type of bird they

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.120 
then the color of what type of bird they
are<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.570> obviously<00:00:54.080> the<00:00:54.230> blue<00:00:54.380> bird<00:00:54.620> will<00:00:54.890> drop

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
a blue feather and you can't actually do

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.350 
a blue feather and you can't actually do
anything<00:00:59.240> with<00:00:59.900> the<00:00:59.990> slingshot<00:01:00.680> yet<00:01:01.360> can't

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
anything with the slingshot yet can't

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.079 
anything with the slingshot yet can't
even<00:01:02.600> put<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:02.989> down<00:01:03.400> but<00:01:04.400> they're<00:01:04.579> working<00:01:05.000> on

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
even put it down but they're working on

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.429 
even put it down but they're working on
that<00:01:05.329> as<00:01:05.810> we<00:01:06.049> speak<00:01:06.079> sets<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.570> apparently<00:01:09.079> the

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
that as we speak sets and apparently the

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.550 
that as we speak sets and apparently the
next<00:01:09.860> it's<00:01:10.070> supposed<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.640> do<00:01:10.759> science<00:01:11.149> well<00:01:11.560> to

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
next it's supposed to do science well to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.100 
next it's supposed to do science well to
make<00:01:12.740> catch<00:01:13.159> them<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.090> hasn't<00:01:14.360> worked

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
make catch them but that hasn't worked

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.490 
make catch them but that hasn't worked
yet<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.060> this<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.360> definitely<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.050> work<00:01:18.350> in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500
