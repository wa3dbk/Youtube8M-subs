 agricultural season 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.939
 material resistant to tearing it especially 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.579
 important when applying to fields and when 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.739
 bonding 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.079
 unlike conventional polyethylene 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.079
 films this material passes 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.590
 water distributing it evenly doesn't 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.319
 eroding the soil without damaging the landing 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.559
 acts as a barrier enclosing 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.439
 plants from hail of strong bird rainfall 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.019

 press nor winter application reliably 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.459
 protects plants from damage by snow 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.949
 cover at early now extends 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.199
 natural peace material misses 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.129
 the fresh air of the plantâ€™s soil breathes but 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.430
 At the same time, the lawyer ex significantly reduces 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.430
 moisture evaporation 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.119
 so graphics is intended for use in 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.609
 agriculture for shelter plants 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.180
 other Chervonia in hours 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.150
 the material is completely eco-friendly and 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.870
 safe for people and plants in 2009 in

 Moscow region in the state farm named after Lenin 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.769
 20 hectares were laid down 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.420
 citizen density and 60 grams per 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.069

 queen strawberries winter earlier spring 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.340
 period 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.639
 Well, we are on the route links 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.639
 this is the one that drove the products 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.810
 plants 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.600
 on the map to handle in 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.690
 that fatal plant material started better 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.050
 and quicker to respond director of Assad 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.480
 which will be here released frs 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.130
 about the status of the day in the future just 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.080
 Overall, the area will fit faster 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.710
 will be stronger stronger glad that the way bill 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.699
 to change 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.740
 but that moment is this and that this and that 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.159
 wiring laying 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.839
 paradox that is, crumbs 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.120
 replace directly 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.310
 award x reduces watering rates as well as white 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.449
 and black materials significantly reduces 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.790
 moisture evaporation 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.100
 improves quality and commercial types of vegetables 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.010
 and berries protects plants from sharp 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.460
 temperature drops keeps the root 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.040
 system optionally prolongs the period 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.760
 vegetation when applying greenhouse 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.440
 farm reduces consumption 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.730
 energy is 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.780
 additional protection in the period 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.439
 low temperatures 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.219
 viagra apex increases fruit yields and 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.080
 berries reduces product losses and risk 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.970
 diseases 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.250
 soil mulching saves money 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.210
 to reduce labor costs when 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.820
 weed control 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.610
 in a safe way without using 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.620
 herbicides creates an opportunity 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.620
 agricultural producers 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.939
 the output is so 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.279
 early and late harvest that raises 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.580
 the cost of vegetables and berries and citizens 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.039
 is an investment financially 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.499
 technical base for at least three 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:51.079
 seasons
