00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
corners so this is the visual when

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
corners so this is the visual when
you're<00:01:44.040> looking<00:01:44.310> ahead<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.659> what

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
you're looking ahead on and this is what

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
you're looking ahead on and this is what
it<00:01:46.020> should<00:01:46.049> look<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.380> from<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> side<00:01:47.329> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it should look like from the side so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
it should look like from the side so
let's<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.780> started<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.829> create

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
let's get started to see if i can create

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.679 
let's get started to see if i can create

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
following is I'm trying to it look it

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.900 
following is I'm trying to it look it
may<00:03:05.200> look<00:03:05.410> like<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:05.800> falling<00:03:06.040> back<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.610> forth

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
may look like I'm falling back and forth

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.390 
may look like I'm falling back and forth
but<00:03:07.209> I'm<00:03:07.360> trying<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.780> file<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:09.370> same

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
but I'm trying to file in the same

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.780 
but I'm trying to file in the same
direction<00:03:10.980> because<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.310> will<00:03:12.430> help<00:03:12.640> you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
direction because that will help you

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.830 
direction because that will help you
know<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.480> long<00:03:13.930> run<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:15.489> prevent<00:03:16.000> lifting

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
know in the long run and prevent lifting

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.440 
know in the long run and prevent lifting
so<00:03:17.140> when<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.350> file<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:18.190> may<00:03:18.790> look<00:03:19.000> like<00:03:19.060> I'm

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
so when I file it may look like I'm

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.870 
so when I file it may look like I'm
falling<00:03:19.690> back<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.500> forth<00:03:20.709> because<00:03:21.400> I'm<00:03:21.670> going

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
falling back and forth because I'm going

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.570 
falling back and forth because I'm going
fast<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.450> I'm<00:03:22.570> actually<00:03:22.840> filing<00:03:23.410> in<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.340> same

fast and I'm actually filing in the same

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.910 
fast and I'm actually filing in the same
direction<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.630> want<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.080> pick<00:03:26.890> a

not<00:05:28.550> too<00:05:28.700> crazy<00:05:28.910> about<00:05:29.120> this<00:05:29.480> middle<00:05:29.870> nail<00:05:30.310> but

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
not too crazy about this middle nail but

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.830 
not too crazy about this middle nail but
that's<00:05:31.490> my<00:05:31.640> shortest<00:05:32.030> nail<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.570> i<00:05:32.630> guess

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
that's to be expected but although i

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.760 
that's to be expected but although i
think<00:05:34.910> they<00:05:35.150> turned<00:05:35.210> out<00:05:35.540> pretty<00:05:35.690> nicely<00:05:36.050> and
