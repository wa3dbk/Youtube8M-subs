00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
often when you talk about this kind of

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.089 
often when you talk about this kind of
case<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:05.960> feel<00:00:06.960> like<00:00:07.290> you're<00:00:07.529> telling<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
case you feel like you're telling the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.879 
case you feel like you're telling the
joke<00:00:08.370> good<00:00:09.030> news<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.570> bad<00:00:09.780> news<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.469> I'll

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
joke good news and bad news and I'll

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.640 
joke good news and bad news and I'll
explain<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.639> soon<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.929> first<00:00:13.170> thing<00:00:13.410> I

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
explain that soon but the first thing I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.860 
explain that soon but the first thing I
don't<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.370> explain<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> could

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
don't have to explain is that you could

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.529 
don't have to explain is that you could
tell<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.710> trachea<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:18.210> could<00:00:18.390> tell

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
tell this is a trachea you could tell

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.750 
tell this is a trachea you could tell
it's<00:00:18.720> bifurcating<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.830> into<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> left<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it's bifurcating here into a left and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000 
it's bifurcating here into a left and
right<00:00:21.000> mainstem<00:00:21.300> bronchus<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
right mainstem bronchus you know that

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.460 
right mainstem bronchus you know that
here's<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.550> karana<00:00:24.029> which<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.900> believe<00:00:25.260> is

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
here's the karana which I believe is

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
here's the karana which I believe is
either<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.890> Latin<00:00:26.250> or<00:00:26.400> Greek<00:00:26.430> work<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:27.150> keel

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
either the Latin or Greek work for keel

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
either the Latin or Greek work for keel
because<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> looks<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> keel<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> boat

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
because it looks like a keel of a boat

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.609 
because it looks like a keel of a boat
doesn't<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.109> des<00:00:31.109> karana

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
place for lymph nodes and here is a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.500 
place for lymph nodes and here is a
large<00:00:36.989> lymph<00:00:37.559> node<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.219> seems<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.120> separate

large lymph node it seems to be separate
from<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.899> lung<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:43.050> could<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
from the lung and you could see that in

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.000 
from the lung and you could see that in
many<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.850> thoracic<00:00:45.379> lymph<00:00:46.379> nodes<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.860> can

many of the thoracic lymph nodes you can

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
many of the thoracic lymph nodes you can
see<00:00:47.129> an<00:00:47.399> abundant<00:00:48.059> amount<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.079> little

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
see an abundant amount of this little

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.340 
see an abundant amount of this little
black<00:00:50.149> Anthrocon<00:00:51.149> pigments<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.170> see

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
black Anthrocon pigments like you see

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
black Anthrocon pigments like you see
here<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.059> here

here in here in here in here
but<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.500> lymph<00:00:55.739> node<00:00:55.980> there<00:00:56.190> might<00:00:56.370> be

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
but in this lymph node there might be

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
but in this lymph node there might be
some<00:00:56.760> remnants<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.420> pigment<00:00:57.930> perhaps<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
some remnants of pigment perhaps a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
some remnants of pigment perhaps a
little<00:00:58.469> bit<00:00:58.680> towards<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> outside<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.359> at

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
little bit towards the outside but at

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
little bit towards the outside but at
least<00:01:00.690> half<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.350> has<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.859> white<00:01:02.309> area

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
least half of it has this white area

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.600 
least half of it has this white area
which<00:01:03.120> looks<00:01:03.510> firmer<00:01:03.899> whiter<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
which looks firmer whiter and is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.359 
which looks firmer whiter and is
relatively<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.390> pigmented<00:01:07.070> relative<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
relatively a pigmented relative to the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
relatively a pigmented relative to the
normal<00:01:08.549> plus<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> lymph<00:01:09.420> node<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> very<00:01:10.020> much

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
normal plus the lymph node is very much

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
normal plus the lymph node is very much
enlarged<00:01:10.740> too<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:12.140> let's<00:01:13.140> explain<00:01:13.740> why<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.430> now

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
enlarged too so let's explain why we now

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.120 
enlarged too so let's explain why we now
have<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> play<00:01:15.720> good<00:01:16.049> news<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.680> bad<00:01:16.890> news<00:01:17.840> if

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
have to play good news and bad news if

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.719 
have to play good news and bad news if
you<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.869> very<00:01:22.560> very

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
you really want to think very very

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
you really want to think very very
simplistically<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.420> mind<00:01:24.659> always

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
simplistically which my mind always

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.890 
simplistically which my mind always
likes<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.580> there's<00:01:26.880> two<00:01:27.390> kinds<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
likes to think that there's two kinds of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620 
likes to think that there's two kinds of
cancers<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:29.299> there's<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> one

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
cancers of the one there's the one

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
cancers of the one there's the one
called<00:01:30.840> ode<00:01:31.049> cells<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> totally

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
called ode cells which is totally

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330 
called ode cells which is totally
synonymous<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> term<00:01:34.079> small<00:01:34.920> cell

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
synonymous with the term small cell

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.210 
synonymous with the term small cell
because<00:01:36.060> oat<00:01:36.299> cells<00:01:36.630> are<00:01:36.869> small<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> then

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
because oat cells are small and then

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
because oat cells are small and then
there<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.430> non<00:01:38.820> oat<00:01:39.180> cells<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.869> we've

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
there are non oat cells and we've

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.870 
there are non oat cells and we've

look at the classic features of oat

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.409 
look at the classic features of oat
cells<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:01.530> first<00:03:01.769> classic<00:03:02.430> feature<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:03.120> that

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
cells the first classic feature is that

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.830 
cells the first classic feature is that
there<00:03:03.629> is<00:03:03.870> such<00:03:04.280> minimal<00:03:05.810> cytoplasm<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:07.319> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
there is such minimal cytoplasm in the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.080 
there is such minimal cytoplasm in the

oat cell is that whenever you see a nest

oat cell is that whenever you see a nest
of<00:03:12.329> cells<00:03:12.629> like<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.169> it<00:03:13.530> looks<00:03:13.859> like<00:03:14.069> it's<00:03:14.280> in

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
of cells like this it looks like it's in

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.699 
of cells like this it looks like it's in
you<00:03:14.579> know<00:03:14.639> 99%<00:03:15.409> nuclei<00:03:18.319> secondly<00:03:19.319> because

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
you know 99% nuclei secondly because

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.300 
you know 99% nuclei secondly because
they<00:03:19.859> are<00:03:19.979> very<00:03:20.280> small<00:03:21.180> cells<00:03:21.919> and<00:03:22.919> often

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
they are very small cells and often

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.610 
they are very small cells and often
round<00:03:23.639> you<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.299> see<00:03:24.540> why<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:25.109> might<00:03:25.470> have

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
round you can see why we might have

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.580 
round you can see why we might have
mistaken<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:27.019> lymphocytes<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.319> low

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
mistaken this for lymphocytes and low

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.920 
mistaken this for lymphocytes and low
power<00:03:28.829> like<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.370> see<00:03:29.579> here<00:03:29.939> when<00:03:30.449> high<00:03:30.659> power

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
power like you see here when high power

power like you see here when high power
you<00:03:31.229> can<00:03:31.409> see<00:03:31.680> they<00:03:32.459> are<00:03:32.489> just<00:03:32.790> irregular

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
you can see they are just irregular

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.129 
you can see they are just irregular
nests<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.290> cells<00:03:34.560> growing<00:03:34.919> in<00:03:35.159> all<00:03:35.430> directions

another<00:03:37.139> feature<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.650> oat<00:03:38.099> cell<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.269> don't

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
another feature of oat cell and I don't

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.640 
another feature of oat cell and I don't
know<00:03:39.629> whether<00:03:39.780> we'll<00:03:39.959> see<00:03:40.169> it<00:03:40.259> here<00:03:40.319> or<00:03:40.590> not

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
know whether we'll see it here or not

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.699 
know whether we'll see it here or not
I'll<00:03:41.310> go<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.909> a<00:03:42.030> couple<00:03:42.299> random<00:03:42.930> places<00:03:43.259> is

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
I'll go to a couple random places is

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.339 
I'll go to a couple random places is
that<00:03:44.310> they<00:03:44.639> grow<00:03:44.879> so<00:03:45.209> fast<00:03:45.239> because<00:03:46.049> we

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
that they grow so fast because we

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.899 
that they grow so fast because we
already<00:03:46.590> told<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.949> they're<00:03:47.159> the<00:03:47.340> nastiest

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
already told you they're the nastiest

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.909 
already told you they're the nastiest
they<00:03:48.419> often<00:03:48.780> outgrow<00:03:49.199> their<00:03:49.439> blood<00:03:49.739> supply

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
they often outgrow their blood supply

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.520 
they often outgrow their blood supply
and<00:03:50.459> become<00:03:50.849> necrotic<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.199> could<00:03:52.379> just

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
and become necrotic and you could just

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.559 
and become necrotic and you could just
see<00:03:52.859> ghostie<00:03:53.430> outlines<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.269> cells<00:03:54.569> and
