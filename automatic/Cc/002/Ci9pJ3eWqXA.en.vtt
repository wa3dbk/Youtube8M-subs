the body and that ends section seven
it's<00:02:45.510> an<00:02:45.600> unorthodox<00:02:45.780> ending<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.540> know<00:02:48.660> you

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
it's an unorthodox ending but I know you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.570 
it's an unorthodox ending but I know you
guys<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.170> get<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.890> practice<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.400> I

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
guys can get it if you practice it I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.830 
guys can get it if you practice it I
think<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:50.940> what<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.180> guys<00:02:51.300> should<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.660> is

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
think that what you guys should do is

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.020 
think that what you guys should do is
watch<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.620> video<00:02:53.240> about<00:02:54.240> five<00:02:54.780> or<00:02:55.050> six<00:02:55.470> times

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
watch this video about five or six times

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
watch this video about five or six times
and<00:02:57.030> by<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.300> sixth<00:02:57.840> repetition<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.520> should

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
and by the sixth repetition you should

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.650 
and by the sixth repetition you should
have<00:02:59.820> it<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:00.150> brain<00:03:00.330> should<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.600> it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
have it in your brain should have it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.070 
have it in your brain should have it
memorized

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
memorized

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.320 
memorized
okay<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.470> let's<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.100> time<00:03:02.310> from<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
okay so let's do it one time from the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.440 
okay so let's do it one time from the
back<00:03:03.510> angle<00:03:03.750> full<00:03:04.170> speed
