00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 body worlds 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.179
 outside are expert tips special as are the speech for after 4 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.539
 next to the web EBC before is percent Martinus in the first part we explained 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.379
 Bitten basically works what will be the eighth is euro fins 

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.869
 needed is 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.229
 and change the suffrage it's my question about Martin Buss week 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.590
 Breakthrough with smoking if he rarely tests people around with them besides 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.140
 come where you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.730
 So always first which xenon there are some motorcycles 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.810
 wa although the setting options Hong Kong thus takes the calculator 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.680
 Reasonably the strut works normally Sander just hangs up 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.950
 an option that replaced Mattersburg content strut from Germany Duran 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.290
 the replica shock absorber 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.770
 Dormann several variants or possibility more pa we have from 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.770
 Webers all sorts of struts and also of ohlins 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.800
 which have the giants advantage compared to the original strut that 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.170
 the setting must be built in there is in German is the find again 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.440
 behind percent 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.650
 underlying 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.159
 rely on leather shoes so the conclusion works well again 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.960
 that means he may read in front of house in the situation if you miss that at Nine 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.540
 Board acute to have the find already 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.970
 to be able to look at the whole team like the individual one 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.329
 or to be able to adjust depending on the type of bicycle 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.450
 and weight but the possibility on the struts 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 to do the DICE just bags why you just go back to the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.870
 Spring bias to vary here was the Danes of 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.440
 this scene Panasonic's percent to 4 until you just go to Leverkusen now 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 no high performance struts like faraway racing 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.869
 The difference is that there are not so many controls 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.790
 Has 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.530
 usually needs for normal road bike with is absolutely necessary 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.240
 the struts as they are here 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.560
 Ars are already available from 499 euros 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.390
 and with that you actually wanted to take a big step. What the rear of the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.660
 Motorcycle concerns 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.690
 under on the Alfa parquet particularly in the acceleration behavior 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.229
 I do not really want that for the sheaves anymore 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.610
 Gently pull the wheels out of German before increasing the complete fork 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.590
 It is usually the big couple who needs to be exchanged 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.319
 and there kind of price-performance ratio finally 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.389
 unacceptable 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.139
 Dorma Abbas can exchange things 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.419
 they never run a first line Bommer through another fork springs we 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.319
 As always, they have to be around here 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.310
 remaking baggage or resting the time then is one of the main problems 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.950
 that the fork of the hard brakes so clear an example too far together 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.090
 the fair stop drives unharmed 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.199
 and Mazda generates 2 percent of very poor driveability 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.159
 but just come with other fork springs it points with strawberries or on the 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.610
 Area lie fork springs 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.579
 Art by pitch help 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.900
 in the end exchanging in the end 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.580
 and because a different spring rate quasi built into the fork 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.200
 As a result, much less Ruthenberg Abeln gets less exercise under protest 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.960
 by formal has better feeling especially in brakes or in situations 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.739
 where the fork is heavily loaded 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.669
 a 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.639
 only the fork springs attachment always shoots already mentioned before only one 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.079
 Step Werner Menke sold that again 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.609
 should adjust 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.959
 a at the beginning, not every cental will 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.400
 and the MoMA Manufacture with different forks that's one 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.049
 Fox next to the cheapest way 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.470
 Pauli proved she goes our goal dispute is solved 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.519
 Arcor one the Danes vary in the fork 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.819
 They measure it according to normal road operation is sufficient 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.779
 and there acute improvement 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.769
 Games before is but too much costs fork springs 10 in the range of 100 euros 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.580
 to get 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.460
 and with the fork in the range of 20 to 30 euros depending on the manufacturer and 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.239
 Davis Cup victory goes 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.849
 So the basic thing you now draw the vehicles normal 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.750
 Can not improve now without big has the FDA invest too 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.800
 and my parents have landing gear which they just usually do away with 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.259
 clearly superior 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.669
 that is, in principle, percent press world is crazy with me with a thousand 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:05.439
 Euro 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.069
 To blossom as well as Stringer Red bring right people on the road properly 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.859
 So the podium is ahead of the bike weight of each one 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.210
 Driver in the vote 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.670
 there can also be consideration or often with pillion is traveling or often 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.520
 alone or with luggage Aarau was mainly street or racetrack 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.110
 it can sometimes blaspheme principles from the struts and 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.950
 Play show included 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.330
 and everyone gets to rent an individual chassis must be on his 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.150
 Needs of is matched 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
 what made a sensation 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.469
 Mexico's Boxmeer anyway 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.409
 There are two options given that Tel would welcome Ramos 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.400
 yes of course so no remedy we have there 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.880
 Â«Finally all the possibilities the question corner 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.900
 led to set depth we can use the struts 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.069
 what IT seemed to shorten the Goblin engine longer 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.210
 Thus, once again a lot of possibilities the vehicle 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.129
 also Andy 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.940
 Body size or the possibilities of the driver to adapt Tina 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.910
 is not just part of dampening spring rate Summum build vehicle height scepter like 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.000
 Mooren der Sieg does not only take care of FÃ¼rth's NABU Fischer 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.460
 Of course, riders on the track also do it for everyone 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.820
 Road driver nevertheless is the fault of Gay's conversions 1200 Euros Sal the Fatmir 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.559
 is a big criterion 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:22.599
 So it's a heavy bike 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.719
 Euro and thus supposedly the possibility of all struts types 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.110
 the pieces went up a little longer in the near future 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.620
 and all adjustments in the end 4 to be able to fight the respective driver 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.879
 Yoneda who would like to have or interest in information and 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.879
 it is possible that his vehicle and have very many possibilities 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.710
 We are now invited to come and call us 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.849
 or spread on the Internet look a 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.470
 of course, this tunnel my people like to know the savior 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.620
 to give any information about every penny that drive on his motorbike so nicely 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.839
 and to make it as pleasant as possible 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.539
 been
