00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 Hello 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.650
 today I wanted to show you something that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.400
 better many know 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.650
 but that can be useful 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.350
 it's usually not much we put it in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.560
 practice 1 d 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.630
 of the fears dare with more points 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.640
 complicated like this we live 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.070
 in the last video that I leave here the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.930
 link so you can see it is a point in 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.469
 each scale that makes a way 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.469
 hearts 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.949
 in which the techniques used are 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.960
 points together of the right to pass the 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.929
 thread or loop to form the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.820
 small holes the simple hold and the short gt 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.149
 double that there also in this video 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.149
 they have 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.010
 to the video where this technique is explained 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.860
 slowly and there is also a post in the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 Blog 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.199
 this type of points, many times 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.320
 intimidates many 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.509
 because it's easy to make mistakes 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.100
 especially if we are distracted we are 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.300
 watching our series our TV 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.120
 etc 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.950
 then or there is a turn 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.010
 specifically complicated 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.460
 it may be that it does not usually happen 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.200
 the easiest when we are working 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.180
 this type of points 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.810
 it does not necessarily have to be a point 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.770
 openwork or lace may be 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.190
 a braid 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.060
 any bushy point 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.620
 it is advice that I give them to use what 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.620
 it's called a live line 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.460
 to frame 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 in the return we want 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.450
 normally, it may be the first 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.450
 of the drawing with a colored thread 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.280
 contrasting 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.799
 a cheap an acrylic or anything 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.099
 they have to be a color 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.990
 contrasting so that if we 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.930
 we made a mistake in the drawing 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.959
 we can undo 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.379
 until that turn where we have the color 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:25.840
 contrast and start over because 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.780
 If you are not very expert it is very difficult 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.970
 when we undo laps come by 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.380
 example to a round where before there was 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.590
 a surf people double strand 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.470
 etcetera etcetera then so not 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.740
 we lose all the work we have 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.100
 done and this does not take much time and 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.100
 we can 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.569
 we can do it at least while 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.569
 we learn 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.940
 and beginners or we are starting 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.390
 then we take a needle lanera n 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.390
 bramos 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.680
 in that contrasting color 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.680
 the simple strand does not 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.740
 and here I finished my return number 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.510
 10 with which I should start over 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.510
 I'm going to pass 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.450
 the thread in contrasting color 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.330
 for each point 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.069
 of this line go through 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.850
 all points 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:42.430
 of my tissue 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.430
 little later on and I have to undo 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.209
 do not have to say 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.870
 do not let go of my hand do not have to 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.870
 undo it 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.760
 on a needle 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.760
 those of upholstery that are thinner 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.650
 by all points 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.220
 and now I will show you what 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.700
 happens if I keep knitting I'm wrong and 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.700
 I want to come back 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.310
 here a mini demonstration I have finished 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.310
 to pass the thread 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.590
 between all the points as I said and 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.320
 Now I'm still knitting that colored thread 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.520
 contrast they ignore it is as if they do not 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.520
 they saw like this 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.259
 what I wanted to show 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.760
 we keep knitting and when I stop 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.590
 once in a while to see the point because 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.169
 anyone can be wrong so I 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.639
 like to go checking 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.060
 and here I realize that there is something weird 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.550
 I see this two points all the time 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.860
 together and if I compare it 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.860
 this piece with this that is the same 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:29.580
 I see that there is something wrong here should have 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:33.590
 this hole and it is not 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.590
 to make sure I tell 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:46.349
 94 26 is wrong with me a point like 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.629
 here somewhere you have forgotten me 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:52.479
 pass the thread so that it forms the 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.350
 hollow I have a point of less should 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.660
 be 27 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.150
 ok as I do not really know where it was that I 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.180
 I was wrong if it was here or it was here we can 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.160
 those that we have more experience 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.890
 weaving we can count following the 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.960
 drawing according to written instructions 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.260
 but this is not about, we do not want 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.449
 stresses that I do 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:19.289
 and what is my live line useful for I undo 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.289
 quietly 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.740
 undo four turns that are 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.740
 find 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.120
 where is the error so I do not 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:35.100
 I worry and it just came 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.100
 on the way back where the thread is 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.040
 and now what do I do 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.040
 I value my points again 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.640
 once I have returned to collect my 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.460
 points I know that what I 'm going to weave here 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.060
 it is the first and simply return 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.060
 continuous 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.620
 and they want to do this, not every five 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.080
 turns imagine that the drawing has 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.480
 six laps are not going to do it every six 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.320
 you can do it for three times 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.180
 every eighteen or every twenty as 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.550
 that we sit more comfortable because 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.580
 we have more practice as this is 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.950
 less necessary but I do think it's going to 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.960
 be very helpful for those who are not 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.180
 still so loose 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.880
 and they accompany me and we dare to do 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.880
 new things seem very good 

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.750
