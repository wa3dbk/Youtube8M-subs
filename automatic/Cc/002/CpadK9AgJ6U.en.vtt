00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.769
 based on the multiple possibilities 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.870
 that offers us the cod today we are going to 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.620
 prepare with it some exquisite 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.340
 croquettes and we are going to make them with 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.340
 following ingredients 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.010
 200 grams of desalted cod 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.640
 three teeth of year 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.830
 parsley 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 bread crumbs 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:41.020
 olive oil 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:44.140
 two eggs 500 grams of potatoes and salt 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.080
 we have known the potatoes and once we 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.540
 they have cooled we peel the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.170
 chop and with a fork the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.170
 crush 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.480
 the cooking time of the potatoes 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.180
 it depends on your size these are rather 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.000
 we've had 35 small ones 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.000
 minutes catching 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.710
 we have chopped the parsley and I 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.710
 we add to the crushed potato 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.050
 pink what we have stripped and we have 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.530
 chopped equally and we add them 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.530
 as well 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.720
 Y 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.370
 all right 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.230
 and finally the cod, cut up and 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.230
 salty we add it 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 Y 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.340
 tel 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.290
 and now with all the ingredients then 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.560
 we mix them all very well 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.230
 we have here the finished mass for 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.470
 go preparing the croquettes we try it 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.530
 and if necessary, certificate of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.790
 health we have beaten the eggs to which 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.619
 we added a splash of milk 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.190
 we put the bread crumbs in another 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.080
 dish and then we are ready to go 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.700
 preparing the croquettes we take a 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.569
 portion 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.569
 fill up 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.670
 we went through the egg 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.120
 and now for the bread crumbs 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.560
 and we are placing on this approach 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.599
 this is repeated as many times as 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.420
 necessary depending on the amount of 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.569
 mass that we have 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.660
 we have put a pan on the fire with 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.620
 abundant olive oil and now 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.620
 We are frying the croquettes 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.320
 We take it off and put them on a plate 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.560
 on an absorbent paper to eliminate 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.120
 the excess oil already we have fries 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:30.160
 these delicious cod croquettes and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.250
 ready to give an account of them 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.170
 and as always, thank you for 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:41.170
 your attention and wish you a happy day 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.170
