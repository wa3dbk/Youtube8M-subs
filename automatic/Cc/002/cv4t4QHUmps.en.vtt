00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
a lower elevation typically cardamoms at

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
a lower elevation typically cardamoms at
a<00:01:04.530> thousand<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> maybe<00:01:05.430> 1500<00:01:06.150> meters<00:01:06.420> above

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
a thousand to maybe 1500 meters above

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.649 
a thousand to maybe 1500 meters above
sea<00:01:06.780> level<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.640> hotter<00:01:08.850> climate<00:01:09.479> here

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
sea level and it's a hotter climate here

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.200 
sea level and it's a hotter climate here
now<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:11.040> makes<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.549> unique<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
now what makes it really unique is the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.510 
now what makes it really unique is the
fact<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.600> most<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> original<00:01:14.310> large

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
fact that most of the original large

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.179 
fact that most of the original large
trees<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.180> been<00:01:15.360> left<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.720> place

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
trees have been left in place

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.560 
trees have been left in place
so<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.400> cardamom<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.880> actually<00:01:18.210> growing<00:01:18.420> in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
so this cardamom is actually growing in

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.390 
so this cardamom is actually growing in
the<00:01:18.689> shade<00:01:18.770> versus<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> majority<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the shade versus the majority of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.830 
the shade versus the majority of
cardamom<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.880> Guatemala<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> grown

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
cardamom in Guatemala which is grown

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.010 
cardamom in Guatemala which is grown
directly<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> Sun<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.210> has<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
directly in the Sun so that has the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
directly in the Sun so that has the
effect<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.470> helping<00:01:25.619> stabilize<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> hills

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
effect of helping stabilize the hills

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
effect of helping stabilize the hills
reducing<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.930> chance<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> landslides<00:01:29.009> as

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
reducing the chance of landslides as

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.149 
reducing the chance of landslides as
well<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:29.970> creating<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.720> richer<00:01:31.290> soil<00:01:31.590> which

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
well as creating a richer soil which

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.980 
well as creating a richer soil which
cardamom<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:32.850> needs<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.390> shallow

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
cardamom really needs with this shallow

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.550 
cardamom really needs with this shallow
root<00:01:34.290> system<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.840> here<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.110> cardamom

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
root system so here we have cardamom

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.280 
root system so here we have cardamom
actually<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.009> are<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.220> tendrils<00:01:39.290> along

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
actually these are the tendrils along

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.749 
actually these are the tendrils along
with<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> cardamom<00:01:40.829> pods<00:01:41.100> forming<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
with the cardamom pods forming on it

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.139 
with the cardamom pods forming on it
this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.270> donald<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> cooperative
