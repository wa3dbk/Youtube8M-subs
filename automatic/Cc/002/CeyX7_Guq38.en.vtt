00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.210
 when getting 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.210
 a circle 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:26.190
 with 6 to 8 laps 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:30.470
 let's continue the weaving but 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:35.770
 placing the rods in vertical 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.770
 interspersing inside and out 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.410
 inside 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.410
 outside 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.120
 we started to place the clip so that 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.120
 pressure us 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.100
 an assembly we put the clip 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.720
 and we take advantage of the moment while they stick 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.610
 for 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.480
 show them 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.480
 we have been weaving 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.979
 and now what we are doing is 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.630
 shaping the wing 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.630
 of the hat 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.470
 down 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.220
 here we have to push to be able 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.730
 give it the shape we want this is a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.690
 hat for 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.690
 a boy or a girl 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.429
 if we want it with the longest wing 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.689
 we can also do it 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.689
 but in this case 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.379
 let's do it this size 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.560
 once stuck 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.960
 What remains is to decide how we are going to 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.490
 decorate 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.410
 and I brought them 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.450
 a piece already finished that is 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.870
 less dense than this one 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.769
 we erase them with crepe paper and what 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:49.040
 we decorate for a recreational activity 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:54.330
 with children are small hats 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.540
 for the use of boys and girls and if 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.110
 we want for the use of teenagers or 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.160
 adults what we have is that the circle 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.379
 initial to put more laps would be 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.269
 about 10 laps and we can 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.269
 get an adult hat
