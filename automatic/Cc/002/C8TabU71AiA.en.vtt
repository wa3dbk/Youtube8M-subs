dollars they had a few other brands and
the<00:00:33.329> only<00:00:33.540> thing<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.809> could<00:00:33.870> tell<00:00:34.670> was<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the only thing I could tell was that

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.520 
the only thing I could tell was that
they<00:00:35.910> had<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> different<00:00:36.570> nozzle<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
they had a different nozzle this is the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.250 
they had a different nozzle this is the
cheapest<00:00:38.010> nozzle<00:00:38.520> comes<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> little

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
cheapest nozzle comes with a little

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.459 
cheapest nozzle comes with a little
spray<00:00:40.260> hose<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:41.129> two<00:00:41.960> but<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.260> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
spray hose or two but then it just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.900 
spray hose or two but then it just
sprays<00:00:43.739> straight<00:00:44.719> but<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.469> other<00:00:46.620> two<00:00:46.920> few

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
sprays straight but the other two few

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
sprays straight but the other two few
dollars<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.110> only<00:00:49.289> thing<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.559> could<00:00:49.620> tell

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
dollars more the only thing I could tell

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
dollars more the only thing I could tell
the<00:00:50.010> difference<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> nozzles

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the difference was that the nozzles

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.529 
the difference was that the nozzles
little<00:00:52.199> fancier<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.070> five<00:00:53.760> dollars<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.420> do

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
little fancier so five dollars to do

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.860 
little fancier so five dollars to do
this<00:00:54.690> repair<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.430> our<00:00:56.430> maintenance<00:00:57.149> really

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
this repair and our maintenance really

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.110 
this repair and our maintenance really
now<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> areas<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.550> spray<00:00:59.850> are

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
now the areas that you want to spray are

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.760 
now the areas that you want to spray are
any<00:01:00.480> part<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.109> moves

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
any part that moves

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.250 
any part that moves
now<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:02.879> exceptions<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
now there's two exceptions to that the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.969 
now there's two exceptions to that the
sidetracks<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.390> shuttle<00:01:06.960> rail<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
sidetracks and the shuttle rail the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
sidetracks and the shuttle rail the
shuttle<00:01:08.340> actually<00:01:08.939> moves<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.689> be

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
shuttle actually moves but will be

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
shuttle actually moves but will be
spraying<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.010> rail<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> shuttle

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
spraying the rail that the shuttle

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.539 
spraying the rail that the shuttle
slides<00:01:12.810> upon<00:01:13.140> will<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.830> spraying<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
slides upon will just be spraying the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.120 
slides upon will just be spraying the
top<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.659> where<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> rolls<00:01:16.290> there

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
top because that's where it rolls there

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
top because that's where it rolls there
are<00:01:17.340> other<00:01:17.580> materials<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.570> use<00:01:18.720> but

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
are other materials that you can use but

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
are other materials that you can use but
this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> best<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.400> not

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
this is one of the best because it's not

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.670 
this is one of the best because it's not
a<00:01:20.580> grease<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> dry<00:01:21.840> lubricant<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
a grease it's like a dry lubricant it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.789 
a grease it's like a dry lubricant it
won't<00:01:23.549> attract<00:01:24.330> dust<00:01:24.869> because<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.680> will

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
won't attract dust because what will

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.330 
won't attract dust because what will
happen<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.970> hinges<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.290> bearings<00:01:29.100> if

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
happen is the hinges and the bearings if

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
happen is the hinges and the bearings if
you're<00:01:29.579> greasing<00:01:30.210> those<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.689> they're<00:01:30.930> not

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you're greasing those and they're not

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.590 
you're greasing those and they're not
sealed<00:01:31.710> bearings<00:01:32.400> little<00:01:33.329> dust<00:01:33.540> particles

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
sealed bearings little dust particles

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.929 
sealed bearings little dust particles
are<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> slowly<00:01:35.369> turn<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
are going to get in and slowly turn that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.960 
are going to get in and slowly turn that
grease<00:01:36.270> into<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> cement<00:01:37.619> basically<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> it'll

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
grease into a cement basically and it'll

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
grease into a cement basically and it'll
just<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.329> hardened<00:01:39.840> mass<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.009> will

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
just be a hardened mass and it will

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.950 
just be a hardened mass and it will
really<00:01:41.549> lower<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> lifespan<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.259> your<00:01:43.590> garage

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
really lower the lifespan of your garage

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.910 
really lower the lifespan of your garage
so<00:01:45.960> let's<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.290> started

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so let's get started

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160 
so let's get started
so<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> way<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.509> your<00:01:48.960> garage

door in sections here and there and
there<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.070> there<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.549> both<00:01:53.729> sides<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.780> are

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
there and there on both sides there are

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.190 
there and there on both sides there are
these<00:01:55.079> hinges<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:57.000> pivot<00:01:57.719> point<00:01:58.049> right

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
these hinges and this pivot point right

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649 
these hinges and this pivot point right
here<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> where<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.700> need<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.000> lubricate<00:02:00.180> all

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
here is where you need to lubricate all

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.290 
here is where you need to lubricate all
the<00:02:01.020> way<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:01.350> left<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.640> up

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
the way down left and right and up

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300 
the way down left and right and up
down<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.170> them<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
down all of them that you can get to and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.580 
down all of them that you can get to and
you<00:02:05.910> just<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.330> do<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.810> quick<00:02:07.140> spray<00:02:08.360> on<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
you just want to do a quick spray on the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.750 
you just want to do a quick spray on the
on<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.220> part<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.880> moves<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:17.340> with<00:02:17.580> this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
on the part that moves so with this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.700 
on the part that moves so with this
design<00:02:18.180> door<00:02:18.450> hinge<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.080> just<00:02:19.350> have<00:02:19.500> these

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
design door hinge you just have these

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.770 
design door hinge you just have these
two<00:02:19.980> points<00:02:20.430> or<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.850> pivots<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.480> don't<00:02:21.660> have

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
two points or it pivots you don't have

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.680 
two points or it pivots you don't have
to<00:02:21.930> put<00:02:22.140> any<00:02:22.350> lubrication<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.910> or<00:02:24.180> on

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
to put any lubrication on there or on

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.540 
to put any lubrication on there or on
the<00:02:24.840> inside<00:02:24.990> it's<00:02:25.500> actually<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.280> metal

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the inside it's actually just a metal

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.420 
the inside it's actually just a metal
bar<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:27.620> hinging<00:02:28.620> right<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.040> these<00:02:29.190> two

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
bar that's hinging right on these two

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.220 
bar that's hinging right on these two
points<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.730> it'll<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.180> seep<00:02:33.480> right<00:02:33.780> down<00:02:34.050> in

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
points and it'll just seep right down in

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.530 
points and it'll just seep right down in
there<00:02:34.410> okay<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.340> now<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:35.910> you're<00:02:36.060> looking<00:02:36.120> at

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
there okay so now what you're looking at

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.440 
there okay so now what you're looking at
is<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.110> bearing<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.460> track<00:02:38.820> right<00:02:39.390> here

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
is the bearing and the track right here

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.590 
is the bearing and the track right here
is<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.170> bearing<00:02:40.560> that's<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.890> round<00:02:41.600> part

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
is the bearing that's the round part

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.900 
is the bearing that's the round part
that<00:02:42.810> kind<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.410> turns<00:02:43.800> like<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> wheel<00:02:44.370> inside

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
that kind of turns like a wheel inside

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.750 
that kind of turns like a wheel inside
the<00:02:45.150> track<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:46.620> there's<00:02:46.860> another<00:02:47.160> pin

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the track and then there's another pin

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.660 
the track and then there's another pin
that's<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.150> hinge<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.750> there's<00:02:48.930> actually<00:02:49.110> two

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
that's a hinge so there's actually two

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.710 
that's a hinge so there's actually two
points<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:52.100> two<00:02:53.100> moving<00:02:53.460> parts<00:02:53.820> on<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.120> now

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
points of two moving parts on this now

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.660 
points of two moving parts on this now
if<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.260> don't<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.650> any<00:02:55.860> access<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
if you don't have any access to the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.650 
if you don't have any access to the
inside<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.720> your<00:02:58.610> bearing<00:02:59.610> then<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.510> have

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
inside of your bearing then you have

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.510 
inside of your bearing then you have
what's<00:03:00.870> called<00:03:00.960> a<00:03:01.260> sealed<00:03:01.590> bearing<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
what's called a sealed bearing and you

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.100 
what's called a sealed bearing and you
don't<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.000> really<00:03:03.240> worry<00:03:03.480> about<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.960> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
don't have to really worry about it it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.590 
don't have to really worry about it it
should<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.830> fine<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.460> this<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:05.940> isn't<00:03:06.180> sealed

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
should be fine but this one isn't sealed

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.620 
should be fine but this one isn't sealed
so<00:03:06.930> we'll<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.230> give<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:08.150> little<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.450> it'll

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
so we'll just give it a little and it'll

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.170 
so we'll just give it a little and it'll
just<00:03:09.870> seep<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.290> there<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.820> then<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.000> already

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
just seep in there and then I already

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.050 
just seep in there and then I already
did<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.750> when<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.110> did<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.500> rest<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.880> then

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
did this when I did the rest but then

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.280 
did this when I did the rest but then
we'll<00:03:15.209> just<00:03:15.390> put<00:03:15.600> some<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.430> there<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.050> want

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
we'll just put some in there so you want

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.090 
we'll just put some in there so you want
to<00:03:19.380> do<00:03:19.470> all<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.100> bearings<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.910> inside

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
to do all of the bearings on the inside

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.690 
to do all of the bearings on the inside
of<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.160> little<00:03:23.610> well<00:03:24.000> right<00:03:24.360> there<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:26.370> then

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
of that little well right there and then

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.479 
of that little well right there and then
if<00:03:26.850> it's<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.209> hinge<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.980> end<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.250> want<00:03:29.400> to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
if it's a hinge on the end you want to

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.880 
if it's a hinge on the end you want to
get<00:03:29.610> those<00:03:29.790> two<00:03:30.060> points<00:03:30.450> as<00:03:30.570> well<00:03:30.840> now<00:03:31.709> I've

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
get those two points as well now I've

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190 
get those two points as well now I've
also<00:03:32.160> noticed<00:03:32.550> that<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.360> hinge<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.959> not

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
also noticed that this hinge is not

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.990 
also noticed that this hinge is not
secured<00:03:35.120> onto<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:37.350> door<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.040> that's<00:03:38.580> another

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
secured onto the door so that's another

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.370 
secured onto the door so that's another
point<00:03:39.330> where<00:03:39.570> things<00:03:39.810> are<00:03:39.959> going<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.110> rattle

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
point where things are going to rattle

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.780 
point where things are going to rattle
around<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.920> can<00:03:41.070> see<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:41.730> just

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
around you can see that it's just

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.000 
around you can see that it's just
jiggling<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.989> I'm<00:03:43.050> glad<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.380> did<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.950> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
jiggling so I'm glad I did that and you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.300 
jiggling so I'm glad I did that and you
want<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.580> inspect<00:03:45.030> while<00:03:45.300> you're<00:03:45.510> here

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
want to just inspect while you're here

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.260 
want to just inspect while you're here
checking<00:03:47.310> all<00:03:47.430> your<00:03:47.459> bearings<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.150> your

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
checking all your bearings and your

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.080 
checking all your bearings and your
hinges<00:03:49.040> make<00:03:50.040> sure<00:03:50.190> all<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.459> bolts<00:03:50.760> are<00:03:50.880> tight

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
hinges make sure all the bolts are tight

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.320 
hinges make sure all the bolts are tight
now<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> case<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.260> my<00:03:52.410> door<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.330> 7/16

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
now in the case of my door it's a 7/16

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.330 
now in the case of my door it's a 7/16
inch<00:03:56.780> okay<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:57.840> here<00:03:58.320> we<00:03:58.350> have<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.830> torsion

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
inch okay so here we have the torsion

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.830 
inch okay so here we have the torsion
springs<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.390> these<00:04:00.780> wind<00:04:01.200> up<00:04:01.440> as<00:04:02.540> are<00:04:03.540> they

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
springs and these wind up as are they

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.680 
springs and these wind up as are they
tighten<00:04:04.350> as<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.430> garage<00:04:05.850> doors<00:04:06.150> open<00:04:06.390> and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
tighten as the garage doors open and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.810 
tighten as the garage doors open and
closed<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.830> we're<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.220> going<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.550> go<00:04:08.670> ahead

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
closed so we're just going to go ahead

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.610 
closed so we're just going to go ahead
and<00:04:08.940> spray<00:04:09.500> just<00:04:10.500> across<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.370> top<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:13.290> it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
and spray just across the top and it

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.129 
and spray just across the top and it
will<00:04:13.740> seep<00:04:14.130> in

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
will seep in

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.789 
will seep in
as<00:04:16.199> you<00:04:17.099> go<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.879> as<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.209> can<00:04:18.359> see<00:04:18.659> it's<00:04:18.840> already

as you go so as you can see it's already

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.330 
as you go so as you can see it's already
doing<00:04:20.099> it<00:04:20.189> and<00:04:20.340> it'll<00:04:20.729> work<00:04:20.969> itself<00:04:21.449> in<00:04:22.340> every

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
doing it and it'll work itself in every

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.969 
doing it and it'll work itself in every
time<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.550> open<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.909> garage<00:04:24.090> door<00:04:24.499> now<00:04:25.499> so

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
time you open the garage door now so

end of the garage door at the top so as

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.200 
end of the garage door at the top so as
it<00:05:28.949> goes<00:05:29.159> down<00:05:29.189> here<00:05:29.400> connects<00:05:29.939> to<00:05:30.120> the

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
it goes down here connects to the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.450 
it goes down here connects to the
torsion<00:05:30.479> spring<00:05:30.990> so<00:05:31.740> we're<00:05:31.889> just<00:05:31.919> going<00:05:32.219> to<00:05:32.250> go

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
torsion spring so we're just going to go

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.950 
torsion spring so we're just going to go
ahead<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:32.759> spray<00:05:33.060> some<00:05:33.089> lubricant<00:05:33.810> down

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
ahead and spray some lubricant down

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.740 
ahead and spray some lubricant down
there<00:05:34.229> this<00:05:34.830> pulley<00:05:35.669> here<00:05:36.029> winds<00:05:36.479> up<00:05:36.599> the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
there this pulley here winds up the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.409 
there this pulley here winds up the
cable<00:05:37.339> as<00:05:38.339> it's<00:05:38.639> being<00:05:38.849> opened<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.330> then

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
cable as it's being opened and then

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.570 
cable as it's being opened and then
let's<00:05:39.659> it<00:05:39.810> back<00:05:39.990> down<00:05:40.259> as<00:05:40.529> the<00:05:40.949> garage<00:05:41.159> door<00:05:41.399> is

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
let's it back down as the garage door is

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.300 
let's it back down as the garage door is
being<00:05:41.789> closed<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:43.199> is<00:05:43.379> an<00:05:43.529> awkward<00:05:43.830> spot<00:05:44.099> I

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
being closed this is an awkward spot I

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.119 
being closed this is an awkward spot I
can't<00:05:44.550> hold<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:44.909> camera<00:05:44.939> and<00:05:45.419> spray<00:05:45.960> at<00:05:46.800> the

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
can't hold the camera and spray at the

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:48.769 
can't hold the camera and spray at the
same<00:05:47.339> time<00:05:47.610> but<00:05:47.849> you<00:05:47.909> want<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.330> spray<00:05:48.569> right

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
same time but you want to spray right

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.649 
same time but you want to spray right
there<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.199> while<00:05:50.099> you're<00:05:50.339> up<00:05:50.370> here<00:05:50.819> this<00:05:51.419> is

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
there and while you're up here this is

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.170 
there and while you're up here this is
the<00:05:51.839> track<00:05:52.199> and<00:05:52.830> so<00:05:53.460> we'll<00:05:53.729> just<00:05:53.939> put<00:05:54.149> some

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
the track and so we'll just put some

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.029 
the track and so we'll just put some
spray<00:05:55.080> in<00:05:55.349> here<00:05:55.649> we<00:05:55.830> don't<00:05:56.009> need<00:05:56.129> a<00:05:56.189> lot<00:05:56.460> but

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
spray in here we don't need a lot but

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.740 
spray in here we don't need a lot but
there<00:05:59.039> are<00:05:59.189> points<00:05:59.550> on<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.909> track<00:06:00.089> that<00:06:00.539> your

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
there are points on the track that your

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.709 
there are points on the track that your
garage<00:06:00.990> door<00:06:01.319> can<00:06:01.560> pinch<00:06:01.889> so<00:06:02.189> if<00:06:02.729> there's<00:06:03.479> any

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
garage door can pinch so if there's any

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.450 
garage door can pinch so if there's any
way<00:06:03.990> that<00:06:04.020> you<00:06:04.259> can<00:06:04.529> give<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.830> any<00:06:05.099> kind<00:06:05.399> of

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
way that you can give it any kind of

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.089 
way that you can give it any kind of
help<00:06:08.270> then<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.360> might<00:06:09.509> as<00:06:09.659> well<00:06:09.830> so<00:06:10.830> we'll<00:06:10.949> do

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
help then you might as well so we'll do

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.980 
help then you might as well so we'll do
that<00:06:11.219> on<00:06:11.279> both<00:06:11.399> sides<00:06:11.789> but<00:06:12.029> you<00:06:12.270> don't<00:06:12.839> really

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
that on both sides but you don't really

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.749 
that on both sides but you don't really
need<00:06:13.199> to<00:06:13.349> worry<00:06:13.529> about<00:06:13.649> the<00:06:13.860> up<00:06:14.009> the<00:06:14.339> upper

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
need to worry about the up the upper

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.899 
need to worry about the up the upper
side<00:06:15.509> of<00:06:15.779> the<00:06:15.930> track<00:06:16.199> just<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.680> bottom<00:06:17.009> okay

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
side of the track just the bottom okay

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.089 
side of the track just the bottom okay
so<00:06:17.969> you<00:06:18.479> may<00:06:18.629> be<00:06:18.689> thinking<00:06:19.169> I<00:06:19.349> need<00:06:19.680> to<00:06:19.830> do<00:06:19.949> the

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
so you may be thinking I need to do the

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.059 
so you may be thinking I need to do the
chain<00:06:20.399> as<00:06:20.580> well<00:06:20.849> not<00:06:21.689> necessarily<00:06:22.529> usually

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
chain as well not necessarily usually

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.699 
chain as well not necessarily usually
they<00:06:23.219> come<00:06:23.460> with<00:06:23.909> a<00:06:23.939> special<00:06:24.870> coating<00:06:25.169> on<00:06:25.469> them

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:25.709 
they come with a special coating on them

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:28.410
