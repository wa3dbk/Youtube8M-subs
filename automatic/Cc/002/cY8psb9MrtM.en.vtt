00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
going to be white then you might want to

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.809 
going to be white then you might want to
do<00:02:10.450> this

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.390 

talita<00:02:13.420> delete<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.319> image<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.799> was<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.129> here

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
be much easier to edit but that would be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.800 
be much easier to edit but that would be
