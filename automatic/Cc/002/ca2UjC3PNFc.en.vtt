quite<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.060> easy<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:09.779> I'm<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.019> to<00:02:10.049> slow<00:02:10.319> that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
quite so easy so I'm going to slow that

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.180 
quite so easy so I'm going to slow that
down

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
down

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.860 
down
so<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.400> see<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.580> my<00:02:12.880> coyote<00:02:13.210> scope<00:02:13.630> is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
so you can see that my coyote scope is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.350 
so you can see that my coyote scope is
now<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> nice<00:02:14.320> green<00:02:14.770> color<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:15.670> lighting<00:02:16.300> up

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
now a nice green color it's lighting up

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.150 
now a nice green color it's lighting up
to<00:02:16.510> show<00:02:16.660> up<00:02:16.750> against<00:02:16.960> dark<00:02:17.320> backgrounds<00:02:17.560> but

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
to show up against dark backgrounds but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.410 
to show up against dark backgrounds but
it's<00:02:18.280> green<00:02:18.550> enough<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:18.940> show<00:02:19.090> up<00:02:19.120> against

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it's green enough to show up against

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.470 
it's green enough to show up against
white<00:02:19.720> background<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:21.090> works<00:02:22.090> pretty<00:02:22.330> well

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
white background and works pretty well

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.920 
white background and works pretty well
as<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> balanced<00:02:23.320> color<00:02:24.240> start<00:02:25.240> firing<00:02:25.600> at<00:02:25.870> him

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
as a balanced color start firing at him

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.250 
as a balanced color start firing at him
when<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:27.070> spot<00:02:27.850> him<00:02:27.910> again<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.510> you'll<00:02:28.990> see<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
when I spot him again and you'll see the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.680 
when I spot him again and you'll see the
first<00:02:29.500> hit<00:02:29.740> marker<00:02:30.190> i<00:02:30.250> get<00:02:30.490> is<00:02:30.670> orange<00:02:31.240> so

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
first hit marker i get is orange so

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.530 
first hit marker i get is orange so
that's<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:32.050> headshot<00:02:32.260> there<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.580> then<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
that's a headshot there and then the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.510 
that's a headshot there and then the
second<00:02:34.960> hit<00:02:35.110> market<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.710> going<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.070> red<00:02:36.340> and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
second hit market is going to be red and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.870 
second hit market is going to be red and
that's<00:02:37.060> when<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.420> kill<00:02:37.660> him<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:39.370> although<00:02:39.730> it

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
that's when I kill him and although it

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.020 
that's when I kill him and although it
happens<00:02:40.300> really<00:02:40.600> quick<00:02:41.080> in<00:02:41.350> game<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.430> do<00:02:42.730> seem

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
happens really quick in game you do seem

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.480 
happens really quick in game you do seem
to<00:02:43.060> notice<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.750> differences<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.310> do

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
to notice the differences so you do

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.250 
to notice the differences so you do
notice<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.970> flash<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.480> orange<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.050> flash

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
notice the flash of orange and the flash

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.060 
notice the flash of orange and the flash
of<00:02:47.410> red<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.870> guns<00:02:50.080> on<00:02:50.230> notice<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.770> makes

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
of red for the guns on notice this makes

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.240 
of red for the guns on notice this makes
the<00:02:51.220> biggest<00:02:51.490> difference<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.750> DMR's<00:02:53.380> now

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the biggest difference to the DMR's now

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.560 
the biggest difference to the DMR's now
the<00:02:55.140> 3.4<00:02:56.140> times<00:02:56.170> scopes<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.400> amazing<00:02:58.390> when

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
the 3.4 times scopes but amazing when

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.810 
the 3.4 times scopes but amazing when
you<00:02:58.690> change<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.440> reticle<00:03:00.010> size<00:03:00.550> and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
you change the reticle size and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.270 
you change the reticle size and
intensity<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:02.140> green<00:03:02.440> i'm<00:03:02.650> using<00:03:03.010> works

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
intensity this green i'm using works

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.270 
intensity this green i'm using works
really<00:03:03.760> well<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.180> these<00:03:04.480> scopes<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.980> tip

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
really well on these scopes and the tip

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.180 
really well on these scopes and the tip
markers<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.060> big<00:03:07.660> difference<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.680> DMR's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
markers is a big difference to the DMR's

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.300 
markers is a big difference to the DMR's
as<00:03:09.430> well<00:03:09.720> usually<00:03:10.720> DMI<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.500> three<00:03:11.740> shot<00:03:11.980> kill

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
as well usually DMI is a three shot kill

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.310 
as well usually DMI is a three shot kill
but<00:03:12.880> that<00:03:13.000> little<00:03:13.180> flash<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.690> color<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.110> get

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
but that little flash of color you get

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.080 
but that little flash of color you get
for<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.560> headshot<00:03:15.010> hitmarker<00:03:15.640> lets<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:15.940> know

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
for a headshot hitmarker lets you know

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.090 
for a headshot hitmarker lets you know
you're<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.300> for<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.540> two<00:03:16.810> shot<00:03:17.080> kill<00:03:17.380> now<00:03:17.950> on

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
you're on for a two shot kill now on

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.850 
assault rifle dropping from five to four
isn't<00:03:21.489> all<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.700> important<00:03:22.420> but<00:03:22.600> on<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.320> DMR

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
isn't all that important but on a DMR

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.860 
isn't all that important but on a DMR
knowing<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.850> you've<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.239> dropped<00:03:25.660> your

time to kill down to two shots that can
help<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.750> out<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.080> lot<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.650> it's<00:03:30.280> not<00:03:30.459> just

your primary weapons at the he's gonna

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.290 
your primary weapons at the he's gonna
affect<00:03:32.590> your<00:03:32.920> pistol<00:03:33.370> scope<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.880> going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.180> be

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
affect your pistol scope is going to be

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.810 
affect your pistol scope is going to be
nice<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.510> green<00:03:34.959> as<00:03:35.140> well<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:36.459> applies<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
nice and green as well it applies to

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.970 
nice and green as well it applies to
anything<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.540> has<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> scope<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:38.650> here<00:03:38.920> you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
anything that has a scope so here you

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.070 
anything that has a scope so here you
can<00:03:39.010> see<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> straw<00:03:39.670> with<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> blue<00:03:40.450> reticle<00:03:40.959> on

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
can see a straw with a blue reticle on

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.890 
can see a straw with a blue reticle on
it<00:03:41.230> from<00:03:41.530> one<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.739> my<00:03:41.890> earlier<00:03:42.340> experiment<00:03:43.000> so

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
it from one of my earlier experiment so

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.470 
it from one of my earlier experiment so
anything<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.680> has<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.100> scope<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.820> going<00:03:46.360> to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
anything that has a scope is going to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.110 
anything that has a scope is going to
change<00:03:46.750> color<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.700> think<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:48.970> biggest

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
change color but I think the biggest

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.270 
change color but I think the biggest
change<00:03:49.360> that<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.810> noticed<00:03:50.380> was<00:03:50.530> how<00:03:50.590> much

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
change that I noticed was how much

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.400 
change that I noticed was how much
information<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:52.090> get<00:03:52.420> back<00:03:52.810> from<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.230> hit

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
information you get back from the hit

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.160 
information you get back from the hit
markers<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.700> here<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.180> know<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.480> get<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.989> red

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
markers so here I know I get the red

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.590 
markers so here I know I get the red
flash<00:03:56.470> now<00:03:57.100> kill<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.400> first<00:03:57.670> guy<00:03:57.850> i<00:03:58.120> can<00:03:58.450> move

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
flash now kill the first guy i can move

different colors flashing by

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.140 
different colors flashing by
one<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.739> most<00:04:19.890> surprising<00:04:20.040> changes<00:04:21.030> is

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
one of the most surprising changes is

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.510 
one of the most surprising changes is
with<00:04:21.330> explosives<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:22.800> throw<00:04:23.100> grenade<00:04:23.490> a

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
guy and a killing I get the red hit

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.460 
guy and a killing I get the red hit
marker<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.390> that's<00:04:27.540> pretty<00:04:27.780> much<00:04:27.900> what<00:04:28.290> you'd

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
marker and that's pretty much what you'd

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.010 
marker and that's pretty much what you'd
expect<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.880> hit<00:04:30.060> markers<00:04:30.450> can<00:04:30.660> tell<00:04:30.900> you

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
expect but the hit markers can tell you

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.050 
expect but the hit markers can tell you
how<00:04:31.230> many<00:04:31.380> people<00:04:31.950> are<00:04:32.040> there<00:04:32.070> when<00:04:32.670> I<00:04:32.700> fire

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
how many people are there when I fire

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.330 
how many people are there when I fire

hip fire reticle is green and my aim
down<00:04:53.250> sight<00:04:53.610> reticle<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.240> green<00:04:54.570> now<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:56.160> aim

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
down sight reticle is green now the aim

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.120 
down sight reticle is green now the aim
down<00:04:56.820> sight<00:04:57.090> reticle<00:04:57.630> isn't<00:04:58.140> as<00:04:58.260> bright<00:04:58.500> green

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
down sight reticle isn't as bright green

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.700 
down sight reticle isn't as bright green
as<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.430> hipfire<00:05:00.240> reticles<00:05:01.020> even<00:05:01.560> though

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
as the hipfire reticles even though

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.370 
as the hipfire reticles even though
they're<00:05:01.950> supposed<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.490> be<00:05:02.670> the<00:05:02.820> same<00:05:03.060> color<00:05:03.420> if

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
they're supposed to be the same color if

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.900 
they're supposed to be the same color if
we're<00:05:04.650> going<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.040> options<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.640> take<00:05:05.880> a

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
we're going to the options and take a

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.180 
we're going to the options and take a
look<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.540> get<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.840> see<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.380> they<00:05:07.530> are<00:05:07.560> the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
look you get to see that they are the

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.930 
look you get to see that they are the
same<00:05:08.430> color<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.210> scroll<00:05:09.630> down<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.640> there<00:05:11.850> they

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
same color and scroll down so there they

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.000 
same color and scroll down so there they
are<00:05:11.970> they're<00:05:12.420> both<00:05:12.630> set<00:05:12.930> up<00:05:13.110> exactly<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.740> same

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
are they're both set up exactly the same

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.950 
are they're both set up exactly the same
but<00:05:14.280> they<00:05:14.550> come<00:05:14.820> out<00:05:15.000> different<00:05:15.540> shades<00:05:15.810> of

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
but they come out different shades of

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.380 
but they come out different shades of
green<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.620> thought<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.700> might<00:05:17.730> be<00:05:17.970> something<00:05:18.240> to

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
green I thought it might be something to

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.390 
green I thought it might be something to
do<00:05:18.600> with<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.840> sizing<00:05:19.440> but<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.920> doesn't<00:05:20.220> seem

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
do with the sizing but it doesn't seem

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.090 
do with the sizing but it doesn't seem
to<00:05:20.460> be<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:21.120> just<00:05:21.480> seems<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:21.750> be<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.140> optic

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
to be it just seems to be that the optic

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.220 
to be it just seems to be that the optic
sights<00:05:23.430> have<00:05:23.820> a<00:05:23.880> pail<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.330> color<00:05:24.750> than<00:05:25.200> the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
sights have a pail of color than the

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.830 
sights have a pail of color than the
hipfire<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.970> other<00:05:27.120> thing<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.360> made<00:05:27.660> this

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
hipfire the other thing that made this

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.900 
hipfire the other thing that made this
really<00:05:28.170> tricky<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.830> work<00:05:28.980> out<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.730> it

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
really tricky to work out is that it

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.220 
really tricky to work out is that it
snows<00:05:30.300> more<00:05:30.600> when<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:31.020> zoom<00:05:31.200> in<00:05:31.910> so<00:05:33.050> like<00:05:34.050> snow

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
snows more when you zoom in so like snow

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.850 
snows more when you zoom in so like snow
heavy<00:05:34.590> snow<00:05:34.910> lights<00:05:35.910> no<00:05:36.650> doesn't<00:05:37.650> make<00:05:37.800> much

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
heavy snow lights no doesn't make much

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.340 
heavy snow lights no doesn't make much
sense<00:05:38.100> because<00:05:38.580> it's<00:05:38.820> even<00:05:39.330> snowing<00:05:39.900> harder

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
sense because it's even snowing harder

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.850 
sense because it's even snowing harder
outside<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.310> area<00:05:41.490> of<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:41.910> scope<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.860> never

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
outside the area of the scope so never

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.250 
outside the area of the scope so never
noticed<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.250> before<00:05:44.570> but<00:05:45.570> yes<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:46.020> snows

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
noticed that before but yes it snows

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.250 
noticed that before but yes it snows
harder<00:05:46.740> when<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.310> zoom<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:49.050> that's<00:05:49.110> a

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
harder when you zoom in so that's a

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.810 
harder when you zoom in so that's a
quick<00:05:49.350> look<00:05:49.590> at<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.800> new<00:05:49.950> reticle<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:50.550> hit

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
quick look at the new reticle and hit

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.180
