00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
today I just lose dry my hair with a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.139 
today I just lose dry my hair with a
round<00:00:47.010> brush<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.620> clean<00:00:50.280> today<00:00:50.760> and

the reason why it's flipping out is not

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799 
the reason why it's flipping out is not
because<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> curlers<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.000> anything<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.629> from

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
