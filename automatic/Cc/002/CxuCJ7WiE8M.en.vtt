the wire into a little bit of egg or
edible<00:00:29.369> glue<00:00:29.720> place<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.230> wire<00:00:31.500> into<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
edible glue place the wire into the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.830 
edible glue place the wire into the
paste<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.290> shape<00:00:35.300> around<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> end<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> the

paste and shape around the end of the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.150 
paste and shape around the end of the
wire<00:00:37.140> first<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.430> little<00:00:40.160> sausage

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
wire first of all into little sausage

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790 
wire first of all into little sausage
shape<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> then<00:00:42.420> squeeze<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.649> front

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
shape and then squeeze it at the front

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.880 
shape and then squeeze it at the front
so<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.700> thinner<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.450> side<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> thicker

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
so it's thinner at one side and thicker

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.819 
so it's thinner at one side and thicker
at<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.719> put<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> aside<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
at the other and then put that aside to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.790 
at the other and then put that aside to
dry<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.510> move<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.440> creating

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
dry and then I can move on to creating

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.240 
dry and then I can move on to creating
the<00:00:53.070> petals<00:00:54.199> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> dried<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.100> I've

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
over the cutter this is a method that I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.649 
over the cutter this is a method that I
find<00:01:46.079> works<00:01:46.530> quite<00:01:46.860> nicely<00:01:47.270> especially<00:01:48.270> if

find works quite nicely especially if

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.010 
find works quite nicely especially if
cutters<00:01:49.049> aren't<00:01:49.350> quite<00:01:49.649> flat<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.520> base

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
flower I'm also going to do a bad so

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.180 
flower I'm also going to do a bad so
I'll<00:02:36.690> cut<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:36.960> another<00:02:37.410> two<00:02:37.950> little<00:02:38.310> petals

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
I'll cut out another two little petals

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.130 
I'll cut out another two little petals
and<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.870> will<00:02:43.050> use<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.560> my<00:02:44.780> partly<00:02:45.780> open

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and this I will use for my partly open

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:55.360 
and this I will use for my partly open
bed<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.870> need<00:02:49.380> two<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.650> those

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.510 

once<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.180> paste<00:02:56.390> has<00:02:56.630> unrolled<00:02:57.260> out<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.860> can

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
once the paste has unrolled out I can

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.170 
once the paste has unrolled out I can
then<00:02:58.730> thin<00:02:59.620> my<00:03:00.620> petals<00:03:01.130> by<00:03:01.340> placing<00:03:01.790> them<00:03:01.940> on

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
then thin my petals by placing them on

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.490 
then thin my petals by placing them on
to<00:03:02.569> my<00:03:02.780> card<00:03:03.410> surface<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.500> work

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
to my card surface and I'm going to work

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.610 
to my card surface and I'm going to work
around<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:08.180> edge<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:09.020> give<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.290> little<00:03:09.380> bit

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
around the edge to give it a little bit

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
around the edge to give it a little bit
of<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:10.040> frilled<00:03:10.670> edge<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.330> also<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.870> thin<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
of a frilled edge and also to thin the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.470 
of a frilled edge and also to thin the
edge<00:03:13.730> there<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.480> I'm<00:03:15.440> using<00:03:15.709> my<00:03:16.209> modeling<00:03:17.209> pin

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
edge there and I'm using my modeling pin

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.729 
edge there and I'm using my modeling pin
to<00:03:17.720> do<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.769> round<00:03:19.040> end<00:03:19.400> here<00:03:20.739> working

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
to do this the round end here working

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.860 
to do this the round end here working
around<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.250> edge<00:03:22.430> with<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:25.280> small<00:03:25.640> one<00:03:25.880> just

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
around the edge with a small one just

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.680 
around the edge with a small one just
the<00:03:27.019> same<00:03:27.050> way<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.549> two<00:03:31.760> petals<00:03:32.060> for<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
the same way of the two petals for the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.280 
the same way of the two petals for the
bad<00:03:33.010> one<00:03:34.010> I'm<00:03:34.220> going<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.700> thin<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.600> as<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.019> is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
bad one I'm going to thin just as it is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.660 
bad one I'm going to thin just as it is
and<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.970> second<00:03:38.420> one<00:03:38.630> I'm<00:03:38.900> going<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.830> elongate

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
and the second one I'm going to elongate

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.199 
and the second one I'm going to elongate
by<00:03:41.599> rolling<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.260> little<00:03:42.590> bit<00:03:42.970> with<00:03:43.970> my

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
by rolling this a little bit with my

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.850 
by rolling this a little bit with my
rolling<00:03:44.630> pin<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.049> makes<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:45.560> a

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
rolling pin so that makes it just a

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.759 
rolling pin so that makes it just a
little<00:03:46.069> bit<00:03:46.190> longer<00:03:47.019> thin<00:03:48.019> around<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.620> edge

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
little bit longer thin around the edge

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.870 
little bit longer thin around the edge
there<00:03:50.620> just<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.709> little<00:03:51.739> bit<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.130> excess<00:03:52.519> paste

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
there just a little bit of excess paste

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.100 
there just a little bit of excess paste
there<00:03:53.239> which<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.319> wanted<00:03:54.709> remove<00:03:55.930> putting<00:03:56.930> up

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
there which I wanted remove putting up

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.220 
there which I wanted remove putting up
with<00:03:57.260> my<00:03:57.440> scissors<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:59.810> I'm<00:03:59.959> going<00:04:00.170> to
