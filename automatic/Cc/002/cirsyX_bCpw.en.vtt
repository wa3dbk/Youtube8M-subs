00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.089
 I'll insert it now 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.509
 on the right if necessary 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.320
 knock plastic or rubber 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.160
 hammer to the axis of the village to the end 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.390
 we put the left pedal well we grease 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:33.120
 the connection is nice to lubricate and inside where 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 the pedal secures the clip onto the cap on 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.610
 These pedals inside are small and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.280
 the teeth so the pedal can be put 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.280
 only in one position but correctly 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.649
 then put the clamp on the cap many 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.250
 think that this is the main pedal mount 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.770
 that's what the pedals hold the clamping bolts they 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.920
 attach the pedal box office cap only gives 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.450
 bearing load 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:10.200
 we tighten it with a special tool 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.619
 he pulls in the pedals and presses 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.619
 bearing 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 we pulled the pedals and pressed the bearing 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.750
 now tighten the coupling bolts with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 pedals mounted as you see we have 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 long boathouse you get the key if you take it 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.799
 over the edge and use how you growl 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.770
 pick a bolt I advise you to take closer to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.100
 head and gently tighten but not 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.320
 too hard to use and torero 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.659
 baths and keys in this case you 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.310
 you will need 10 15 units that's enough 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.990
 need to check these bolts every time 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.659
 when you sit down pour out 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.670
 especially because of the pedal new they usually 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.070
 loosened after several trips 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.770
 I strongly advise you to check the coupling bolts in 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.299
 time of the first trip and then check 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.299
 every few trips 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.310
 the order
