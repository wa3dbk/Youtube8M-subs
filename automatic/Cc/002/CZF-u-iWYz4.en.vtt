00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.270
 Greetings to all lovers of grape 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.059
 Vines today video will be dedicated 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.830
 grape bush fertilizer passed 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 bloom is already the result of bloom 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 pollination but I will separately make a video 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.990
 This new gift Zaporozhye principle and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.119
 getting dusty 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.769
 Well, well, who would they ask ask 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.859
 questions from Volodya you say there to him 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.369
 trust those whom those repeat again and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.260
 then I'll show you exactly what I'm fertilizing 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.250
 if you have access to the air this 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.840
 great any not any horse 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.020
 pork mullein 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.660
 only rotted mixture only with 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.940
 somehow different and chicken only 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.370
 rotted only about kings 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.840
 Respectively can be rotten but not 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.239
 completely so that he was a little bit 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.949
 wet and and horse can even 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.330
 use fresh if you have 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.760
 good access to 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.440
 on the air I would advise you 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.619
 grind rows 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.470
 inside that is, here's a bush if 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.869
 60 centimeters to 60 here in 5 layers 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.140
 centimeters to mulch from spring 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.910
 dung and I'll tell you nothing more 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.250
 no need it would be just great 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.850
 it would be happiness for grapes he 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.770
 will grow in ayah actively fruiting 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.430
 but due to the fact that we have a cow now 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.910
 where there is practically no power only 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.630
 summer resident manure only dreams apply then 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.979
 what is 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.280
 gardeners mow the grass put barrels bathroom 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.369
 gaining water and ferment the grass if 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 have nettle access to wild culture 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.590
 it is a mine of microelements that is we mow 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.580
 grass push the barrel we put nettle 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.250
 we dump 57 days and we fertilize nitrogen above 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.580
 roofs on the wall and would i be christi and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.099
 only thank you micro 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.470
 macronutrients have nitrogen macronutrients a 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:09.069
 microelements slightly smaller well phosphorus 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.239
 and potassium absolutely she is nothing 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:17.690
 the following fertilizer is already fertilizer 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.440
 complex nitroammofosk mofos to have 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.470
 liquid 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.890
 concentrate growth that is a bunch of strength now 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.560
 I will tell you what I fertilize personally, I will now give you 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.640
 I'll show you my personal fertilizer 200 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.709
 liters . 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.410
 if you look well you will see 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.500
 now they are almost another day 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:46.459
 two and bird droppings already fermented here 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.370
 mullein it's all somewhere was bombarded here 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.850
 in the lower circle everything is added to some water 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.210
 and 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.670
 shuffled every day nitrogen here in 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.310
 excess and phosphorus potassium trace elements and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.260
 macronutrients here everything is what I do 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.250
 before drinking this 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.580
 search for the product we pour then take the floor 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.920
 buckets floor buckets under the bush and on top 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.990
 I pour some more buckets of water 23 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.140
 well there are four there how much water do you have 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.540
 have this fertilizer the very best 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.540
 effective nothing else but him 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.620
 you can not use well, return our 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.740
 it prepared a little table what else 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.340
 using 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.650
 and so called ammophos to nitroammofoska 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.810
 here nitrogen is phosphorus potassium that is if u 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.930
 you don't buy anything 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.010
 aisle 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.940
 water well with some water and 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.070
 fertilizer reaches the roots if you want 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.640
 take 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.010
 25 30 grams per match water bucket 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.650
 boxes Zorka times breed 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.620
 and watering at the root of someone says 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.970
 which is better to give fertilizer immediately and then 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.640
 pour water well that is 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.100
 stir give fertilizer pour water i 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.230
 no i'm doing wrong i first moisten 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.530
 roots that is, I give a little bit of water a 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.240
 then the fertilizer that I use in 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.180
 this used already this year 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.540
 that's where there wrote comments and 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.510
 told tried this new 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.240
 fertilizer way again I can not get through 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.590
 past the store the gardener is not an advertisement 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.440
 just repeat it again 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.150
 thanks advised 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.490
 I like the sellers and take it 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.720
 professional fertilizer asking 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.200
 than i won on some bushes with me 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.400
 was chlorosis here by the way one of the ways 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.600
 get away from chlorosis 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.220
 foliar treatment by this fertilizer 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.300
 Of course, I also used iron chelate 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.210
 and brexit mix but may be a coincidence can 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.910
 really the effect was all 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.080
 bushes and greens frost yellow all 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.360
 great so if you don't have access to 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.600
 all this can be used but here 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.270
 not 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.520
 I do not know can be seen if just 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.490
 I keep bottles of ordinary gum 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.350
 there is a sodium humate a potassium humate and in general 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.030
 it is necessary there quite a bit but with him 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.870
 need to fool around in warm water 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.550
 dilute and then there is a big 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.520
 concentration do and then this 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.790
 concentration was diluted by others 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.030
 big tanks and water well there is not 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.780
 nitrogen there is no nitrogen so she 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.570
 add urea or carbamide here so 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.430
 what i use here later when i 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.210
 already moving on biological products repeat 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.490
 it is from July 15 here again but who can 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:52.330
 I did not see the previous movie Mika sonbe 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.919
 and paints these two drugs i use 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.730
 Required with every treatment 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.600
 I add to each treatment here 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:05.120
 here are the drugs 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.400
 eyes they are in liquid form very well 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.530
 absorbed by plants with them I already 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:14.570
 I work well, probably so that here are five 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.690
 already working with these fertilizers that is 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.070
 This super fast suits me 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.380
 you won't see the effect 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:27.310
 but the effect is believe it all principle 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.919
 I wanted to say you can have any 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.450
 to choose preferences for these mineral water 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.910
 please mineral water work 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.620
 Foliar fertilization Root attach 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.970
 from respecting hurt and please 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.729
 reach manure reach grass 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.580
 mulcher go away manure mulcher go away grass 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.650
 that is, use many baikal 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.200
 I use it somehow with baikal 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.390
 grown well need perseverance need time 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.640
 i don't have it 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.950
 used only for overlapping 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.770
 manure now i'm using california 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.169
 worms already ten years they compost me 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.360
 a bunch in less than seven eight months 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.820
 make a great first class 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.010
 comfort even as soon as a bunch i clean and 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.000
 sort of like they no longer have them crawl away 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.440
 there is only a bunch of vineyards everywhere 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.810
 starts to grow a little bit of water 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.850
 they are already in this pile and it turns out 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:24.340
 wonderful compost that just 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:27.669
 even clothes and and eat well, it's so fun 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.410
 if you like some other way 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:33.200
 say write in comments can 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:36.979
 something I took him maybe Perry 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.890
 tell and someone uses this experience 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:42.530
 which one you use ie share 

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:45.320
 my experience and I hope that this video 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.599
 was helpful to you for your 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.580
 Vineyard grow grow 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:52.160
 good harvests and God forbid of course 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.680
 hail let it go somewhere like that 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.440
 side of the asphalt falls because 

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.320
 we just yesterday crooked horns passed 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.380
 hurricane in by pulling out a lot of trees 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.870
 beat the cars well, that is very bad 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.940
 thank god very words literally here 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:11.120
 300 meters passed 

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.410
 passed a heavy downpour well again everyone 

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.970
