main reasons why I hate the early East
series<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> e60<00:02:37.830> 400<00:02:38.430> s<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> e<00:02:38.790> 64<00:02:39.330> tens<00:02:39.630> is

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
series the e60 400 s in the e 64 tens is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
series the e60 400 s in the e 64 tens is
because<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:40.590> really<00:02:40.920> wear<00:02:41.100> out<00:02:41.310> quick<00:02:41.730> but

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
because they really wear out quick but

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.330 
because they really wear out quick but
this<00:02:42.570> one<00:02:42.780> hasn't<00:02:42.989> worn<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> lot<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:44.100> hard

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
this one hasn't worn out a lot the hard

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.100 
this one hasn't worn out a lot the hard
drive<00:02:44.520> had<00:02:44.760> really<00:02:45.030> low<00:02:45.209> hours<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.750> I'd<00:02:45.840> assume

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
drive had really low hours so I'd assume

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.440 
drive had really low hours so I'd assume
it<00:02:46.260> wasn't<00:02:46.410> used<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.830> much<00:02:47.239> might<00:02:48.239> have<00:02:48.330> been

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
it wasn't used that much might have been

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.120 
it wasn't used that much might have been
a<00:02:48.480> portable<00:02:48.989> machine<00:02:49.080> for<00:02:49.500> some<00:02:49.770> corporate

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
a portable machine for some corporate

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.490 
a portable machine for some corporate
office<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.820> rarely<00:02:51.270> got<00:02:51.570> me<00:02:51.720> used<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.290> sat

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
office that rarely got me used and sat

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.720 
office that rarely got me used and sat

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
it's not worn out that bad on this one

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.540 
it's not worn out that bad on this one
