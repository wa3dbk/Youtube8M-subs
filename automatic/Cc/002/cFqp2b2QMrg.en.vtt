00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.499
 Until the second day of the opening 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.349
 In front of the practice at the Tosu Stadium, the city has 24 coaches 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.349
 I spoke to the election 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.869
 Mentally strong in any situation 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.189
 moved unreasonably 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.599
 In this, which has four shambles, an attacker was taken 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.820
 This stadium is next year but I can not express myself 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.810
 Make a false report 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.450
 Become stronger with yourself 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.320
 I'm Matsuyama 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 But it is said that they will agree 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 It was mental strength 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400
 Content that the opponent lost in the nine-year opener 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.340
 Tanaka's fris reflects swf 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.330
 Strong opposition to the US government 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 Tanaka's feelings are overflowing 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.350
 Okumura Kunihiko 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 And on the other hand 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 Cat 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.770
 No score and go to overtime 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 I understand the feelings of Tanaka player 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.030
 The battle of re-departure of winning a penalty kick battle is a cutter 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.020
 Authenticity height 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 It is the beginning of a battle to head to a new goal 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 I understood 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 Is it only the end for this? 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.780
 Further 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.299
 It is said that we have supported our daily life 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.140
 Very happy 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.220
 It was net 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 It looked really fun in many ways 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.140
 Today's j-league team is worth over 2 billion yen a year 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.250
 Of course it is released of course of player 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.310
 It is included 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.759
 The previous j league is said to establish a sports club closely connected to the community 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.889
 Was in the basic philosophy of 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.599
 It is still necessary last month 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.079
 If you think Nojiri is true, the facility will be dissolved and liquidated 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.839
 I think the Sony Silver Index has something to do 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.329
 For local teams who can not support the true big business 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:25.839
 Splash 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.420
 What kind of figure from now on 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.900
 I'm going to leave 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.779
 Sagantos also has a true meaning 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.219
 We want you to look for a steady activist closely connected to the local community 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.979
 Do you think that the player's dream is getting less and less 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.819
 Suddenly felt 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.549
 I think there is a high goal, so I can overcome it 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.549
 He said he had courage and was over-sized writers
