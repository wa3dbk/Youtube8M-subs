00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 friends I have something for you that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.280
 Constant smartphone loading is 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.800
 incredibly annoying wireless clubbing 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.929
 however, it is unbelievably great 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.490
 simply you do not need to constantly 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.020
 rumärgern with a cable 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.660
 and if you nevertheless times be brief 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 wants to look during the loading then 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.350
 you just take the phone from charging 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 bed and can use it without cable 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.710
 play in a nutshell and then just do it 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.000
 return again 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 now there are out there though 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.080
 an incredible number of wireless charging pads 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.669
 and to give you the choice a bit too 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.540
 I'll make it easier for you now and then 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.210
 which ago 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.680
 after i last finished the quintet of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.300
 ikea tested 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.399
 then also the wireless 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.469
 charline sorry for the iphone i have 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.079
 Today a chic model of Bookeen 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.210
 for you if there is more than that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.129
 to be smart and flat and what to me 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.030
 I do not like it that much, I show 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.309
 you today 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.559
 so now there is my review for 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.590
 wireless charging pad from berlin i 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 have fun 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.879
 which of course is the first thing you notice 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 that the thing is incredibly flat and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.090
 it's a tight one 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.990
 centimeters high and about 11 5 cm wide 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.700
 and long 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.380
 maybe you can underneath it now 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.180
 do not imagine so much 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.830
 That's why you see it all here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.640
 direct comparison with a sheet 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.619
 toilet paper 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.509
 because that's what each of us should do now 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.310
 have home and for the smartphone 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.110
 Lovers among us are there too 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.350
 still a short comparison with the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.220
 apple iphone 6 and the galaxy s of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.680
 samsung 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.840
 if you would ask me how I feel 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.750
 a cool ufo imagine then it would have 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.060
 probably pretty much this shape the pad 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.490
 is rounded off on all corners but to the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.590
 luck is not complete round it laughs 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 down and change the color of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.970
 black proof and then there is 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.009
 still the pad of the underside 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.079
 and this one is black again 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.180
 gummed of course that has a sense 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.310
 because the gumming leaves the pad 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.740
 exactly where it should be and slips 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 not everything works well 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.500
 Great 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.030
 the bottom is only from the micro usb 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.799
 slot interrupted 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.600
 Here he simply packs a cable 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.009
 your choice in and you can already do yours 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 smartphone loading 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.970
 what pleases with that is the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.360
 fact that bikini is a very long one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.690
 can 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.550
 with supplies it's about 180 long and 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.680
 so you can easily open the pad then 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.930
 Position the desk around without 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.630
 that then pulls the cable from behind and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.280
 you should somehow restrict yourself 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.050
 the cable but then be too long 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.110
 you just take another cable that 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.880
 lying around with you and doing well is like this 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.470
 it then takes with the power supply 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.890
 just any one that we you 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.780
 flies around and that works of course 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.000
 we come again to the top 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.160
 By the way, matt plastic is made of it 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.470
 the complete pad will be here again 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.870
 through a glossy colored glossy 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 black colored ring interrupted the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.520
 the shop area of ​​the legal area 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.140
 Delimited are the compatible ones of course 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.790
 only the smartphones that too 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.440
 standard support 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.239
 you should not be sure if 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.980
 also your smartphone this standard 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.380
 simply look at the list of uses 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.150
 I packed in the description some 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.670
 support smartphones is from home 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.130
 For example, the galaxy is 6 and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.080
 the galaxy s 6 as with others 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.750
 smartphones you have to retrofit then 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.730
 for the lg, for example, there is one 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.459
 quick circle kate with his help 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.620
 You can also wirelessly 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.900
 load as I said in the description 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.030
 there is a list just look there 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.510
 after and then you know if yours too 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.640
 Smartphone is also there we find 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.190
 on the top still a work in fire 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.950
 and a small charge led the fight back up 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.440
 green flashes and when fully charged 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.269
 battery then green the surface lights up 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.160
 By the way, it feels like the soft one 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.870
 touch surfaces of some smartphones 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.670
 So I would not have to worry 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.769
 make your smartphone somehow 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.690
 scratched when it is lying on the bed and 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.760
 Of course it would be just as important 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.220
 to know that the loading via wireless 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.850
 charging takes a little longer than normal 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.920
 on 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.049
 So if you have a lot of power in a short time 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.250
 need then is definitely the very 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.140
 normal power adapter 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.450
 but if you just do it overnight or 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.030
 wants to boost long time then so 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.310
 A patron really cool and what I think 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.380
 now of the thing so I'm totally 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.360
 where he does that and I think so too 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.489
 that beling pad from belkin is great 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.530
 it does what it is supposed to see 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.630
 good it is very compact and leaves 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.810
 lie down everywhere with you and also 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.980
 The long cable is of course practical 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.390
 which one is the thing 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.830
 but also pay well and me 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.990
 think that you still have the price 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.300
 could do something about the whole thing 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.850
 to make the customer more attractive 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.190
 currently you pay about 30 euros for 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.960
 The thing , of course, varies 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.580
 put down a link in the below 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.340
 description then he could be one 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.360
 See current price and also the 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.580
 product side also which wireless 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.470
 you can find loads here you can 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.810
 read everything again if you want 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.390
 as I said shortly summarized the thing 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.890
 is great but it must be a 30 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.750
 it's definitely worth the euro 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.430
 cheaper alternatives 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.120
 yes and that should be it already 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.480
 Thank you very much for your time 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.480
 take care
