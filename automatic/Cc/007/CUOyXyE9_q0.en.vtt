accomplished<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.740> goal<00:01:35.770> but<00:01:36.340> now<00:01:36.460> she's<00:01:36.670> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
accomplished that goal but now she's a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.010 
accomplished that goal but now she's a
little<00:01:36.970> bit<00:01:37.150> over<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.450> top<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.780> laning

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
little bit over the top of the laning

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
little bit over the top of the laning
phase<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.470> we're<00:01:38.590> targeting<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:39.010> few<00:01:39.220> nerfs

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
phase so we're targeting a few nerfs

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.850 
phase so we're targeting a few nerfs
specifically<00:01:40.540> for<00:01:40.720> her<00:01:40.810> early<00:01:41.110> game<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
specifically for her early game the

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.920 
specifically for her early game the
first<00:01:42.130> one<00:01:42.280> we're<00:01:42.400> doing<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.820> we're<00:01:43.600> lowing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
first one we're doing is we're lowing

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.780 
first one we're doing is we're lowing
her<00:01:44.049> base<00:01:44.290> health<00:01:44.590> regeneration<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.670> to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
her base health regeneration this is to

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.160 
her base health regeneration this is to
allow<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.030> little<00:01:46.119> more<00:01:46.420> counter<00:01:46.720> play<00:01:46.869> in<00:01:46.990> lane

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
allow a little more counter play in lane

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.660 
allow a little more counter play in lane
when<00:01:47.560> an<00:01:47.650> opponent<00:01:47.860> actually<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.369> able<00:01:48.580> to

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670

any of those tools away we thought we

chip away at the base test instead I

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.670 
chip away at the base test instead I
understand<00:02:04.960> were<00:02:05.080> also<00:02:05.320> changed<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
understand were also changed the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.770 
understand were also changed the
cooldown<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.130> our<00:02:06.340> ultimate<00:02:06.640> sure<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.630> we're

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
cooldown on our ultimate sure so we're

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.359 
cooldown on our ultimate sure so we're
increasing<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.289> cooldown<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.799> the<00:02:09.009> early

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
increasing the cooldown on the early

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.190 
increasing the cooldown on the early
ranks<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> her<00:02:09.789> ultimate<00:02:10.119> especially<00:02:10.599> because

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
ranks of her ultimate especially because

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.509 
ranks of her ultimate especially because
right<00:02:11.379> now<00:02:11.409> she's<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:11.739> snowballing<00:02:12.250> top

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
right now she's just snowballing top

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.089 
right now she's just snowballing top
lane<00:02:12.730> too<00:02:12.999> hard<00:02:13.419> we<00:02:14.409> actually<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:14.829> where<00:02:15.010> it

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
lane too hard we actually like where it

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.769 
lane too hard we actually like where it
is<00:02:15.189> again<00:02:15.489> late<00:02:15.909> game<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.299> mid<00:02:16.419> game<00:02:16.569> in<00:02:16.719> her

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:16.779 
is again late game and mid game in her

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.220 
is again late game and mid game in her
performance

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
performance

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.780 
performance
there<00:02:17.379> but<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> problem<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.400> she<00:02:18.519> gets<00:02:18.670> an

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
there but the problem is if she gets an

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.309 
there but the problem is if she gets an
early<00:02:18.970> lead<00:02:19.269> on<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.750> gets<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.959> little<00:02:20.170> bit

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
early lead on you and gets a little bit

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.720 
early lead on you and gets a little bit
of<00:02:20.379> an<00:02:20.440> edge<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.709> gets<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.950> kill<00:02:21.159> off<00:02:21.310> by<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
of an edge and gets a kill off by the

of an edge and gets a kill off by the
time<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:22.000> respawn<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.629> get<00:02:22.780> back<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.080> lane<00:02:23.290> or

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
time you respawn and get back to lane or

time you respawn and get back to lane or
Ultimates<00:02:23.860> already<00:02:24.280> able<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.700> be<00:02:24.790> cast<00:02:24.970> again

Ultimates already able to be cast again

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.330 
Ultimates already able to be cast again
and<00:02:25.540> she'll<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.049> kill<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.379> over<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.099> over

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and she'll just kill you over and over

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.130 
and she'll just kill you over and over
and<00:02:27.580> over<00:02:27.760> again<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.780> causing<00:02:29.019> her<00:02:29.110> to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and over again is it causing her to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.509 
and over again is it causing her to
snowball<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> little<00:02:29.920> bit<00:02:30.040> too<00:02:30.159> much<00:02:30.310> out<00:02:30.459> of

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
actually like that a lot there's two

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.830 
actually like that a lot there's two
problems<00:03:57.340> with<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.700> right<00:03:57.880> now<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.599> first

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
problems with the right now the first

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.390 
problems with the right now the first
problem<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.590> cast<00:03:59.829> rate<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.129> really

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
problem is the cast rate is really

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.580 
problem is the cast rate is really
really<00:04:00.760> long<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.239> far<00:04:01.599> outside<00:04:02.139> of<00:04:02.169> herself

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
really long it's far outside of herself

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.319 
really long it's far outside of herself
detection<00:04:03.010> radius<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:03.760> therefore<00:04:03.910> she<00:04:04.209> can

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
detection radius so therefore she can

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.330 
detection radius so therefore she can
basically<00:04:04.480> snake<00:04:05.049> people<00:04:05.379> with<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.620> we're<00:04:06.220> not

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
basically snake people with it we're not

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.890 
basically snake people with it we're not
super<00:04:06.730> happy<00:04:06.910> with<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:07.480> we're<00:04:07.629> bringing

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
super happy with that so we're bringing

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.330 
super happy with that so we're bringing
down<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.019> cast<00:04:08.290> range<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.650> better<00:04:08.889> match<00:04:09.129> her

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
down the cast range to better match her

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.339 
down the cast range to better match her
stealth<00:04:09.639> range<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.690> other<00:04:10.720> change<00:04:11.230> we're

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
stealth range the other change we're

still<00:05:40.260> think<00:05:40.290> that<00:05:40.560> area<00:05:40.980> of<00:05:41.010> effect<00:05:41.130> junglers

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
still think that area of effect junglers

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.760 
still think that area of effect junglers
are<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:42.270> little<00:05:42.600> bit<00:05:42.780> too<00:05:42.930> dominant<00:05:43.410> over<00:05:43.620> their

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
are a little bit too dominant over their

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.560 
are a little bit too dominant over their
single<00:05:44.130> target<00:05:44.460> counterparts<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.450> we're

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
single target counterparts so we're

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.880 
single target counterparts so we're
taking<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.930> little<00:05:46.020> bit<00:05:46.230> more<00:05:46.320> health<00:05:46.560> out<00:05:46.770> of

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
taking a little bit more health out of

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.680 
taking a little bit more health out of
the<00:05:46.980> small<00:05:47.310> monsters<00:05:47.760> and<00:05:47.940> putting<00:05:48.360> into<00:05:48.510> the

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
the small monsters and putting into the

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.120 
the small monsters and putting into the
big<00:05:48.840> monster<00:05:49.200> so<00:05:49.380> kind<00:05:49.530> of<00:05:49.590> even<00:05:49.830> this<00:05:49.920> out<00:05:50.100> a

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
big monster so kind of even this out a

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.100 
big monster so kind of even this out a
bit<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:51.060> second<00:05:51.420> change<00:05:51.570> we're<00:05:51.750> doing<00:05:51.990> is

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
bit the second change we're doing is

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.200 
bit the second change we're doing is
we're<00:05:52.230> putting<00:05:52.260> a<00:05:52.530> bit<00:05:52.770> more<00:05:52.920> gold<00:05:53.280> back<00:05:53.940> into

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
we're putting a bit more gold back into

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.000 
we're putting a bit more gold back into
a<00:05:54.240> couple<00:05:54.480> of<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.690> camps<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:55.770> sort<00:05:55.980> of

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
a couple of the camps this is sort of

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.830 
a couple of the camps this is sort of
give<00:05:56.130> more<00:05:56.370> of<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.490> trade-off<00:05:56.790> between<00:05:57.090> ganking

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
give more of a trade-off between ganking

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.480 
give more of a trade-off between ganking
and<00:05:57.990> applying<00:05:58.260> lane<00:05:58.440> pressure<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.980> farming
