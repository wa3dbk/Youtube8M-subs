00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
piece of paper so it's the mirror image

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.530 
piece of paper so it's the mirror image
of<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.830> keep<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.340> tight<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:33.480> as

so<00:01:01.270> just<00:01:02.200> lining<00:01:02.530> up<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.740> plate<00:01:03.010> with<00:01:03.220> this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
so just lining up the plate with this

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.030 
so just lining up the plate with this
other<00:01:03.910> registration<00:01:04.600> just<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:05.470> make<00:01:05.860> sure

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
other registration just to make sure

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.550 
other registration just to make sure
that<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.370> paper<00:01:06.580> has<00:01:06.910> even<00:01:07.600> two<00:01:07.990> inch<00:01:08.200> border

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
that the paper has even two inch border

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.790 
that the paper has even two inch border
all<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.710> way<00:01:08.830> around<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:10.290> basically<00:01:11.290> by<00:01:11.770> doing

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
all the way around it basically by doing

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.700 
all the way around it basically by doing
this<00:01:12.160> we<00:01:12.520> don't<00:01:12.670> have<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.910> draw<00:01:13.870> like<00:01:14.230> cord

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
this we don't have to draw like cord

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.100 
this we don't have to draw like cord
around<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.250> or<00:01:15.430> be<00:01:16.060> able<00:01:16.120> to<00:01:16.240> be<00:01:16.390> gonna<00:01:16.780> cut<00:01:17.020> it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
around it or be able to be gonna cut it

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.490 
around it or be able to be gonna cut it
out

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
out

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.620 
out
just<00:01:17.830> kind<00:01:18.010> of<00:01:18.040> get<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.490> being<00:01:19.420> in

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
just kind of get to it being in

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.990 
just kind of get to it being in
printmaking<00:01:19.960> yeah<00:01:20.830> you're<00:01:21.070> around<00:01:21.490> like<00:01:21.820> this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
printmaking yeah you're around like this

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.300 
printmaking yeah you're around like this
really<00:01:22.750> old<00:01:22.870> equipment<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.979> you're<00:01:24.130> thinking

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
really old equipment and you're thinking

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.850 
really old equipment and you're thinking
about<00:01:24.790> kind<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.240> how<00:01:25.900> they<00:01:26.080> used<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.500> do<00:01:26.590> things

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
about kind of how they used to do things

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.120 
about kind of how they used to do things
but<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.310> think<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.760> it<00:01:28.660> it<00:01:29.140> makes<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:30.070> makes

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
but I think that it it makes it it makes

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.740 
but I think that it it makes it it makes
easier<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.700> think<00:01:30.850> about<00:01:31.150> how<00:01:31.300> we<00:01:31.360> do<00:01:31.570> things

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
easier to think about how we do things

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.230 
easier to think about how we do things
now<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.380> where<00:01:33.160> it<00:01:33.340> came<00:01:33.490> from

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
now and where it came from

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.499 
now and where it came from
it's<00:01:34.900> kind<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.110> like<00:01:35.520> either<00:01:36.520> get<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.360> good

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
it's kind of like either get a good

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's kind of like either get a good
friend<00:01:37.810> for<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:37.990> don't<00:01:38.200> because<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:39.040> can't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
friend for you don't because you can't

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.310 
friend for you don't because you can't
really<00:01:39.460> go<00:01:39.610> back<00:01:39.640> it's<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.660> only<00:01:40.900> have<00:01:41.110> one

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
really go back it's you only have one

00:01:41.320 --> 00:02:02.750 
really go back it's you only have one
one<00:01:42.040> chance<00:01:42.310> that's<00:01:42.580> why<00:01:42.729> it's<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.970> mano

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.370 

the<00:02:03.760> dry<00:02:04.000> that's<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.780> don't<00:02:05.110> think<00:02:05.140> we

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the dry that's it I don't think we

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.730 
the dry that's it I don't think we
should<00:02:05.410> ever<00:02:05.590> really<00:02:06.100> get<00:02:06.700> rid<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:06.910> this<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
should ever really get rid of this this

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.600 
should ever really get rid of this this
is<00:02:09.220> older<00:02:09.580> tradition<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:11.050> think<00:02:12.040> it's<00:02:12.220> there's

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
is older tradition I think it's there's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.990 
is older tradition I think it's there's
a<00:02:12.700> lot<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:13.000> uses<00:02:13.120> for<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:15.250> makes<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.760> I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
a lot of uses for it just makes you I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.640 
a lot of uses for it just makes you I
mean<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.360> actually<00:02:16.570> work<00:02:17.140> with<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.500> art

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
mean to actually work with the art

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.920 
mean to actually work with the art
instead<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.280> just<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.640> that's<00:02:19.090> about<00:02:19.420> brand

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
instead of just like that's about brand

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.660 
instead of just like that's about brand
it's<00:02:20.280> totally<00:02:21.360> different<00:02:22.360> experience
