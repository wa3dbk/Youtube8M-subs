00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.330
 I would not do and 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.600
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.370
 I will talk about a possible character 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.530
 that could appear in the series of 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.810
 super dragon ball this character is 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.910
 nice which many of the fans 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.160
 of dragon ball they liked it a lot 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.380
 your level of power or your fighting style or 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.300
 simply by its appearance and in what 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.100
 personal what I like very much is 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.440
 his blue outfit and out of 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.210
 orange inside but if we take in 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.550
 account for the new dress of goku and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.830
 vegeta in the resurrection of offering the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.480
 new appearance of benito would be more or 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.150
 less as shown in the image 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.100
 well it's very possible that benito appears 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.230
 in this series because there are still more 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.480
 clayey cover with those who could 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.610
 merge and it has been confirmed that there will be 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.739
 much more powerful enemies in the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.930
 neighboring universes so if there were 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.880
 the great need to do so could be 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.010
 possible since there would be the way that 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.540
 goku vegeta be reseparated and 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.909
 that if they manage to enter another dimension 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.340
 they could go back to normal and maybe 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.500
 the entrance to the sixth universe or any 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.960
 another is another dimension so 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.640
 I would personally believe that if possible 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.920
 go back to see this character in the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.650
 future chapters of dragon ball 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.720
 only if it's a very desperate case in the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.490
 that there are no other options since there is no 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.649
 forget that a vegueta has never 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.930
 liked the idea of merging their bodies 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.000
 goku but not necessarily be 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.490
 benito the one that appears in the new series 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.560
 possibly goku could merge with 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.840
 goian as had been planned during 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.700
 the saga of ma jin wook eye this is only 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.710
 a theory because today 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.930
 We know that Goyana has abandoned her 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.700
 training to devote your time to 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.250
 the studios so their level of 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.500
 power has decreased a lot and also in 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.240
 Freser's resurrection is left very 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.640
 clear that neither to goku nor to vegueta them 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.710
 I like to team although I suppose that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.390
 in the other universes they are very 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.429
 weak compared to others 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.679
 gods so maybe they decide 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.810
 merge so your level is not so 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.569
 low and achieve compare their power with 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.269
 other gods good friends that has been 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.220
 all do not forget to give like if the video 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.500
