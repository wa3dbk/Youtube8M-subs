 sand and skill hide rough skin 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.850
 to be able to have a hook what 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.449
 we have to do is have a free and 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 make evolve engavete at level 24 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.140
 hook to level 48 in level up 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.390

 the best natures that we can 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 put this pokemon I would put the 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.530
 firm nature that increases us the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.930
 physical attack and we would lower the attack 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.210
 special since this pokemon has 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.340
 very much physical attack or also you 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.320
 we can put the cheerful nature that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.040
 it increases our speed a lot and we 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.720
 would go down to the special attack too 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.820
 it would serve this nature quite well because 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.540

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.540
