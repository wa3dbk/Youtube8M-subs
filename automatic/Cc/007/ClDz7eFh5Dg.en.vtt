place<00:01:50.730> what<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.270> made<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
place what we just made on that and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:02.060 
place what we just made on that and
finally<00:01:53.580> attach<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:56.060> t<00:01:57.060> by<00:01:57.180> 2<00:02:00.080> like<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
finally attach it to t by 2 like so and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
finally attach it to t by 2 like so and
that's<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.550> running<00:02:02.790> core<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.210> haven't<00:02:03.870> given

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that's the running core I haven't given

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.480 
that's the running core I haven't given
it<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.260> name<00:02:04.290> yet<00:02:04.650> I'll<00:02:04.860> probably<00:02:05.010> need<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.310> lot

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
it a name yet I'll probably need a lot

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.169 
it a name yet I'll probably need a lot
of<00:02:05.520> time<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:05.760> have<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.660> video<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:08.179> whatever

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of time I have the video up so whatever

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.740 
of time I have the video up so whatever
the<00:02:09.360> title<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.899> know<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.440> called

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
the title is you know what it's called

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.390 
the title is you know what it's called
yeah<00:02:12.750> that's<00:02:12.870> prevalent<00:02:13.230> relatively<00:02:14.100> short

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
yeah that's prevalent relatively short

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.460 
yeah that's prevalent relatively short
but<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> does<00:02:14.970> increase<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.870> guess<00:02:16.020> its<00:02:16.200> stamina

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
but it does increase I guess its stamina

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.130 
but it does increase I guess its stamina
is<00:02:16.830> hack<00:02:16.980> promise<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:17.550> yeah<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.720> that's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
is hack promise but yeah so that's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.980 
is hack promise but yeah so that's
running<00:02:19.410> course<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.190> side<00:02:20.780> next<00:02:21.780> we're

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
running course that side next we're

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.310 
running course that side next we're
going<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.500> make<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.250> weight<00:02:23.580> disk<00:02:24.050> which<00:02:25.050> I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
going to make the weight disk which I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.930 
going to make the weight disk which I
also<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.710> not<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> name<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.520> at<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
also do not have a name for at the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.200 
also do not have a name for at the
moment<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:28.250> basically<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.880> you're<00:02:30.030> going<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
moment and basically all you're going to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.240 
moment and basically all you're going to
do<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.080> get<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.830> these

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
do is just going to get two of these

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.060 
do is just going to get two of these
four<00:02:33.060> by<00:02:33.180> four<00:02:33.420> wings<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.110> two<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.560> these<00:02:34.650> four

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
four by four wings and two of these four

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.750 
four by four wings and two of these four
or<00:02:35.220> four<00:02:35.400> wings

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
or four wings

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.610 
or four wings
and<00:02:37.330> you're<00:02:37.569> just<00:02:37.689> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.080> connect<00:02:38.409> them

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
and you're just going to connect them

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.830 
and you're just going to connect them
with<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:41.290> live<00:02:41.500> three<00:02:41.799> pieces<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.549> go<00:02:43.420> all<00:02:43.629> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
with to live three pieces and go all the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.770 
with to live three pieces and go all the
way<00:02:43.870> around<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:45.939> almost<00:02:46.269> round

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
way around so that it's almost round

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:55.949 
way around so that it's almost round
almost<00:02:47.409> put<00:02:47.890> round<00:02:48.099> way<00:02:48.489> disk<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:54.930> you've<00:02:55.930> got

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
almost put round way disk so you've got

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.770 
almost put round way disk so you've got
this<00:02:56.379> thing<00:02:56.709> if<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.579> done<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.879> correctly

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
this thing if you done it correctly

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.330 
this thing if you done it correctly
I'm<00:03:00.440> going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.680> need<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.950> show<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.160> guys<00:03:01.280> how

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
I'm going to need to show you guys how

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.980 
I'm going to need to show you guys how
to<00:03:01.430> make<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:01.940> anyway<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
to make that but anyway so you have to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.850 
to make that but anyway so you have to
put<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.260> aside<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:06.290> now<00:03:06.560> we're<00:03:06.709> going<00:03:06.800> to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
put that aside and so now we're going to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.430 
put that aside and so now we're going to
make<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.160> attack<00:03:07.580> ring<00:03:08.110> we're<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:09.350> to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
make the attack ring we're just going to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.080 
make the attack ring we're just going to
go<00:03:09.560> ahead<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.830> build<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.250> on<00:03:10.430> top<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:11.000> that

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
go ahead and build it on top of that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.720 
go ahead and build it on top of that
it's<00:03:11.209> not<00:03:11.330> about<00:03:11.720> us<00:03:11.840> pull<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.140> back<00:03:12.260> out<00:03:12.730> and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
it's not about us pull it back out and

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.290 
it's not about us pull it back out and
you're<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.000> going<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.240> put<00:03:14.420> two<00:03:15.940> 1<00:03:16.940> by<00:03:16.970> twos

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
you're just going to put two 1 by twos

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.309 
you're just going to put two 1 by twos
in<00:03:17.660> these<00:03:18.440> places<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.600> put<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.840> two<00:03:20.959> by

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
in these places and then put a two by

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.570 
in these places and then put a two by
four<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.739> then<00:03:21.860> we<00:03:21.950> love<00:03:22.130> them<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.430> doesn't

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
four and then we love them it doesn't

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.890 
four and then we love them it doesn't
have<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.060> one<00:03:23.180> with<00:03:23.270> holes<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.720> just

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
have to be the one with holes I just

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.780 
have to be the one with holes I just
using<00:03:24.140> google<00:03:24.440> school<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:26.330> then<00:03:27.580> let's<00:03:28.580> see

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
using google school and then let's see

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.040 
using google school and then let's see
here<00:03:29.120> we're<00:03:29.300> going<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.860> replace<00:03:31.300> two<00:03:32.300> three<00:03:32.930> by

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
here we're going to replace two three by

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.250 
here we're going to replace two three by
three<00:03:33.350> wings<00:03:33.800> like<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.510> has<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.930> be<00:03:36.170> in

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
three wings like so it has to be in

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.370 
three wings like so it has to be in
these<00:03:36.410> corners<00:03:36.769> or<00:03:37.190> wait<00:03:37.600> no<00:03:38.600> this<00:03:38.989> corner

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
these corners or wait no this corner

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.130 
these corners or wait no this corner
lined<00:03:40.190> up<00:03:40.340> with<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.519> curved<00:03:40.970> make<00:03:41.840> sure<00:03:41.989> it's

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
lined up with the curved make sure it's

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.820 
lined up with the curved make sure it's
on<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.470> one<00:03:42.590> with<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.769> curved<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:44.709> power<00:03:45.709> if

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
on the one with the curved it power if

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.770 
on the one with the curved it power if
it's<00:03:45.980> not<00:03:46.130> but<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.239> make<00:03:47.390> sure<00:03:47.420> down<00:03:47.630> on<00:03:47.690> the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
it's not but so make sure down on the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.000 
it's not but so make sure down on the
curves<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.170> then<00:03:48.319> you're<00:03:48.410> going<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.680> get<00:03:48.769> two

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
curves and then you're going to get two

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.280 
curves and then you're going to get two
more<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:50.319> four<00:03:51.319> hours<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:53.720> place<00:03:53.989> them<00:03:54.170> in

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
more the four hours and place them in

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.740 
more the four hours and place them in
the<00:03:54.319> other<00:03:54.560> two<00:03:54.800> spots<00:03:55.120> you've<00:03:56.120> got<00:03:56.300> this<00:03:56.600> now

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
the other two spots you've got this now

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.360 
the other two spots you've got this now
you<00:03:59.350> know<00:03:59.470> what<00:03:59.590> let's<00:03:59.800> just<00:03:59.890> go<00:04:00.130> ahead<00:04:00.250> and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
you know what let's just go ahead and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.450 
you know what let's just go ahead and
put<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.790> running<00:04:00.970> koro<00:04:01.180> I'm<00:04:01.300> just<00:04:01.510> gonna<00:04:02.460> so

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
put the running koro I'm just gonna so

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.770 
put the running koro I'm just gonna so
yeah<00:04:03.610> put<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.940> running<00:04:04.150> poor<00:04:04.300> on<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.570> got<00:04:04.690> the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
yeah put the running poor on you got the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.030 
yeah put the running poor on you got the
weight<00:04:04.930> disk<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.320> now<00:04:05.410> we're<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:05.890> process

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
weight disk and now we're in the process

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.650 
weight disk and now we're in the process
the<00:04:06.310> attack<00:04:06.490> ring<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:06.850> this<00:04:07.000> is<00:04:07.030> like<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.420> base

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
the attack ring so this is like the base

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.570 
the attack ring so this is like the base
of<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:09.040> now<00:04:09.340> you're<00:04:10.150> just<00:04:10.420> going<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.900> get

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
of it and now you're just going to get

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:19.130 
of it and now you're just going to get
two<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.610> these<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:14.730> guess<00:04:15.730> you'd<00:04:16.000> say<00:04:16.510> 8<00:04:17.500> by<00:04:17.950> 3

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
two of these I guess you'd say 8 by 3

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:27.810 
two of these I guess you'd say 8 by 3
half<00:04:20.140> octagon<00:04:20.709> things<00:04:21.549> or<00:04:21.880> whatever<00:04:26.820> these

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
half octagon things or whatever these

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.770 
half octagon things or whatever these
sides<00:04:29.370> they<00:04:30.370> have<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.670> be<00:04:30.700> on<00:04:31.060> this<00:04:31.360> side<00:04:31.600> so

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
sides they have to be on this side so

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.040 
sides they have to be on this side so
what<00:04:32.260> have<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.380> put<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:32.860> on<00:04:33.480> you<00:04:34.480> have<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.750> be

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
what have you put it on you have to be

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.470 
what have you put it on you have to be
able<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.380> pass<00:04:35.500> look<00:04:35.710> like<00:04:35.919> this<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.460> not<00:04:36.970> yep

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
able to pass look like this and not yep

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.020 
able to pass look like this and not yep
that's<00:04:38.020> like<00:04:38.200> that<00:04:38.500> because<00:04:38.950> it<00:04:39.340> changed

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
that's like that because it changed

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.710 
that's like that because it changed
performance<00:04:40.419> as<00:04:40.510> well<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:42.790> tape<00:04:43.060> because<00:04:43.240> most

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
performance as well it tape because most

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.659 
performance as well it tape because most
the<00:04:43.840> time<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.110> spends<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.440> left<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:44.919> the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
the time it spends the left and the

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.970 
the time it spends the left and the
performance<00:04:46.390> will<00:04:46.510> change<00:04:46.720> if<00:04:47.110> dynamics<00:04:47.830> are

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
performance will change if dynamics are

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.000 
performance will change if dynamics are
different<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.940> now<00:04:49.330> once<00:04:50.230> you<00:04:50.350> put<00:04:50.620> those<00:04:50.770> on

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
different so now once you put those on

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.860 
different so now once you put those on
you're<00:04:51.190> going<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.340> get<00:04:51.460> these<00:04:51.790> two<00:04:52.690> of<00:04:52.780> these

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
you're going to get these two of these

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.030 
you're going to get these two of these
two<00:04:53.860> by<00:04:54.010> twos<00:04:54.570> look<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.780> whole<00:04:56.140> trip<00:04:56.650> thing<00:04:56.919> on

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
two by twos look the whole trip thing on

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.000 
two by twos look the whole trip thing on
the<00:04:57.130> end<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.490> just<00:04:57.610> place<00:04:57.970> them<00:04:58.180> in<00:04:59.010> spots

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
the end and you just place them in spots

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.780 
the end and you just place them in spots
here<00:05:00.419> what<00:05:01.419> look<00:05:01.600> like<00:05:01.630> this<00:05:02.080> no<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:05.790> getting

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
here what look like this no and getting

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.400 
here what look like this no and getting
it<00:05:08.190> I'm<00:05:09.190> moving<00:05:09.850> on<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.390> bit<00:05:10.930> protector

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
it I'm moving on to the bit protector

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.540 
it I'm moving on to the bit protector
just<00:05:11.650> because<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:11.860> can<00:05:12.010> put<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.310> on<00:05:12.430> and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
just because I can put that on and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.700 
just because I can put that on and
finish<00:05:12.729> it<00:05:12.850> being<00:05:13.630> almost<00:05:13.840> done<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.530> can't

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
finish it being almost done you can't

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.550 
finish it being almost done you can't
get<00:05:15.000> these<00:05:16.000> turn<00:05:16.419> another<00:05:16.750> turning<00:05:17.229> two<00:05:17.410> by

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
get these turn another turning two by

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.990 
get these turn another turning two by
two<00:05:17.620> I've<00:05:17.950> made<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.310> video<00:05:18.490> in<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.669> while<00:05:18.700> out

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
two I've made a video in a while out

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.820 
two I've made a video in a while out
this<00:05:19.180> way<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:19.390> it's<00:05:19.750> taking<00:05:20.200> me<00:05:20.500> a<00:05:20.530> while<00:05:20.650> to

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
this way so it's taking me a while to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.409 
this way so it's taking me a while to
get<00:05:21.010> back<00:05:21.070> into<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.400> then<00:05:22.150> you're<00:05:22.270> going<00:05:22.360> to

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
middle like this we've got the bit

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.760 
middle like this we've got the bit
protector<00:05:31.180> in<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.960> finish<00:05:32.140> it<00:05:32.260> off<00:05:32.470> you're

they are just get for the corner like

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.860 
they are just get for the corner like
pieces<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:53.889> you're<00:05:54.040> going<00:05:54.220> to<00:05:54.340> place<00:05:54.840> two<00:05:55.840> of

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
pieces and you're going to place two of

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.629 
pieces and you're going to place two of
them<00:05:56.699> like<00:05:57.699> going<00:05:58.330> around<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.860> corner<00:06:00.280> of<00:06:00.430> the

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
them like going around the corner of the

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.050 
them like going around the corner of the
two<00:06:01.060> by<00:06:01.210> three<00:06:01.479> so<00:06:02.320> like<00:06:02.740> so<00:06:02.979> and<00:06:03.250> you're<00:06:03.970> gonna
