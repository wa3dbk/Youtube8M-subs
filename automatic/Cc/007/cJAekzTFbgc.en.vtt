00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
water so i might be poor the rubens I

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.860 
water so i might be poor the rubens I
might<00:03:39.820> not<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.180> was<00:03:40.299> thinking<00:03:40.570> about<00:03:40.690> maybe

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
might not I was thinking about maybe
