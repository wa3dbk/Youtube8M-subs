allowed in the line for safety reasons
today<00:00:44.960> we<00:00:45.260> use<00:00:45.410> a<00:00:45.440> machine<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.519> is<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.730> reed

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
today we use a machine this is a reed

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.770 
today we use a machine this is a reed
cutter<00:00:47.449> a<00:00:47.809> beast<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.650> a<00:00:48.739> machine<00:00:49.629> well<00:00:50.629> now

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
cutter a beast of a machine well now

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.740 
cutter a beast of a machine well now
we've<00:00:50.989> cut<00:00:51.199> some<00:00:51.589> reed<00:00:52.000> I've<00:00:53.000> picked<00:00:53.269> up<00:00:53.360> four

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
we've cut some reed I've picked up four

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.079 
we've cut some reed I've picked up four
bundles<00:00:54.050> just<00:00:54.589> enough<00:00:54.890> for<00:00:55.100> one<00:00:55.129> swans<00:00:55.729> nest

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
bundles just enough for one swans nest

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.810 
bundles just enough for one swans nest
so<00:00:56.690> now<00:00:56.930> all<00:00:57.229> we<00:00:57.379> have<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.559> do<00:00:57.800> is<00:00:58.190> take<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.489> over

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
so now all we have to do is take it over

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:08.400 
so now all we have to do is take it over
to<00:00:58.940> where<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.089> Swans<00:00:59.420> choose<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.989> nest

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.560 

typical<00:01:09.590> I<00:01:09.620> just<00:01:10.250> dropped<00:01:10.550> four<00:01:10.910> bundles<00:01:11.180> for

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
typical I just dropped four bundles for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.860 
typical I just dropped four bundles for
a<00:01:11.630> second<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.440> two<00:01:12.680> birds<00:01:12.980> were<00:01:13.160> prospecting

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
a second and two birds were prospecting

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.600 
a second and two birds were prospecting
but<00:01:14.870> this<00:01:15.110> isn't<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.500> way<00:01:15.620> for<00:01:16.100> them<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.250> nest

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
but this isn't the way for them to nest

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.720 
but this isn't the way for them to nest
it's<00:01:17.360> much<00:01:17.660> more<00:01:17.870> comfortable<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:18.680> we<00:01:18.860> arrange

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
it's much more comfortable if we arrange

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.550 
it's much more comfortable if we arrange
the<00:01:20.060> bundles<00:01:20.480> and<00:01:20.690> there's<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.230> much<00:01:21.410> better

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
the bundles and there's a much better

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.580 
the bundles and there's a much better
place<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.370> nest<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:29.720> female<00:01:30.229> Swan

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
place for the nest the female Swan

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.240 
place for the nest the female Swan
behind<00:01:31.040> me<00:01:31.280> always<00:01:31.690> nests<00:01:32.690> right<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.290> she'd

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
behind me always nests right here she'd

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.520 
behind me always nests right here she'd
been<00:01:34.460> waiting<00:01:34.670> for<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:35.720> material

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
been waiting for this material

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.490 
been waiting for this material
she<00:01:37.070> had<00:01:37.310> no<00:01:37.610> material<00:01:38.270> around<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:39.200> make<00:01:39.350> her

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
she had no material around to make her

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.030 
she had no material around to make her
own<00:01:39.530> nest<00:01:40.240> that's<00:01:41.240> my<00:01:41.479> job<00:01:41.810> I'll<00:01:41.990> make<00:01:42.650> a<00:01:42.680> nest

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
own nest that's my job I'll make a nest

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.010 
own nest that's my job I'll make a nest
and<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.310> think<00:01:43.700> she'll<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.180> straight<00:01:44.450> up<00:01:44.570> on<00:01:44.869> it

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
and I think she'll be straight up on it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:57.340 
and I think she'll be straight up on it
I<00:01:55.360> start<00:01:56.360> off<00:01:56.570> with<00:01:56.810> more<00:01:57.140> or<00:01:57.200> less<00:01:57.320> a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
I start off with more or less a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.160 
I start off with more or less a
triangular<00:01:58.160> breed<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:59.479> break<00:01:59.840> some

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
triangular breed and then break some

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.550 
triangular breed and then break some
Reed<00:02:00.410> inside<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.520> triangle<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:03.170> doesn't<00:02:03.440> look

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
Reed inside the triangle it doesn't look

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.469 
Reed inside the triangle it doesn't look
great<00:02:03.710> but<00:02:04.310> they<00:02:04.369> will<00:02:04.729> sort<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.240> they'll

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
great but they will sort it they'll

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.560 
great but they will sort it they'll
round<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.080> out<00:02:06.369> within<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.520> day<00:02:07.700> or<00:02:07.729> two<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.270> will

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
round it out within a day or two it will

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.930 
round it out within a day or two it will
be<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> swamp<00:02:09.050> nest<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:09.679> imagine<00:02:10.580> eggs<00:02:10.759> will<00:02:10.910> be

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
be a swamp nest I imagine eggs will be

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.180 
be a swamp nest I imagine eggs will be
here<00:02:11.270> within<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.600> week<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.530> hopefully<00:02:13.010> by
