00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.030
 restoration 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:23.080
 the problem was small 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:23.080
 that is, there is a good scratch 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:33.790
 we eliminate oil paints and silicone 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.790
 grease 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.329
 wax crayon 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:50.440
 smeared hollow in order not to 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.440
 there was a recess 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.270
 in the direction of the fiber 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.519
 eliminate the light 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:42.239
 do strokes repeating pattern 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:42.239
 fibers to interrupt the uneven line 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.970
 draw new windows 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:48.680
 close to a distance of 40 centimeters 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.680
 almost no longer visible 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.820
 if at 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.820
 and see then 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:11.150
 here the paint looks different 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:15.140
 to give uniform gloss 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.140
 use silicone grease 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.380
 and rest in peace 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:55.190
 excess silicone removed turned out 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.190
 uniform shine 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.240
 here it is our sara why live hard 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.240
 hard to see
