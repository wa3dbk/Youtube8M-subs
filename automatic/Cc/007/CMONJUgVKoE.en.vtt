and<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:20.780> always<00:02:20.990> afraid<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.030> get

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
and I was always afraid that I get

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.590 
and I was always afraid that I get
problems<00:02:23.900> with<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.110> cameras<00:02:24.500> but<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:26.420> all

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
problems with the cameras but they all
