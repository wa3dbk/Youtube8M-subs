00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.310
 had had, I would like to show you how 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.880
 you put a hard drive in a glass of a bathroom 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.469
 and what to look for on the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.559
 different interfaces of the kids 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.260
 before getting a housing fortune 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.330
 why is that done? 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.800
 if you have a pc for example now 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.460
 or a letter that you do not use 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 and you want to be able to get the data out 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.619
 to install it in a housing and so on 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.119
 Either get the data out if you can 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 needs or is still considered 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.660
 external hard disk available because it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.660
 is very unfortunate turn 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.700
 Here I have my three different ones 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.960
 Kinds of housing this is now 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.559
 to do 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.520
 the houses with an idea connection that 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.489
 here is a 2 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.840
 with sata connection and this is a 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:03.379
 3.5 inch housing with sata connection no 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.180
 I like housing because I like it 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.540
 Unfortunately I have no idea firmly pack 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.040
 With 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.820
 let's start here with the housing 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:22.460
 What is the corresponding hard disk here 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:26.300
 Here you can see the pins and here 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.640
 the controller just becomes her 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:36.410
 plugged very slowly with it yes 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.509
 the pins does not break off and then it sounds 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:44.990
 the whole just put it in here 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:48.640
 led lamp usb connection here you should 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.159
 give then maybe beaten 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.770
 the same here in appearance 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.009
 actually pretty identical only the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.250
 interface inside is one 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.189
 sata interface the associated 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.040
 This will be your hard disk 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.369
 just plugged in pretty easy 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.860
 just like the idea firmly 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.180
 and something entered the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.500
 do not screw here on the left and right 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.500
 Forgot it out 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.280
 this is the dirt must with customs 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.690
 hard drive the something different 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.730
 usually I am used to one 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.410
 controller to have exactly where 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.480
 looks like this state 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.180
 disk where you put again a 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.800
 but in the case here we have it like 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.110
 on the computer here for the power supply 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.200
 the longer one with just here 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:56.480
 put in and many garden 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:03:04.880
 transfer of it right afterwards 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:07.030
 it is easy to get into the housing 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.959
 remove the power here 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.660
 usually you have a rail 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.540
 remember directly but belong to this 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.640
 I should have it differently here it will be 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.390
 still screwed so that the guests 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.390
 had it right
