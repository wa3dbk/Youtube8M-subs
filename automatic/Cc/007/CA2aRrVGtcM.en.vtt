feeding<00:00:01.530> fruit<00:00:01.770> trees<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.250> really<00:00:02.850> simple<00:00:03.210> you

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
feeding fruit trees is really simple you

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.140 
feeding fruit trees is really simple you
want<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.230> measure<00:00:04.440> approximately<00:00:04.950> one<00:00:05.850> cup

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
want to measure approximately one cup

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.179 
want to measure approximately one cup
for<00:00:06.390> every<00:00:06.990> inch<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.230> trunk<00:00:07.529> diameter<00:00:07.710> and

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
for every inch of trunk diameter and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.280 
for every inch of trunk diameter and
that's<00:00:08.730> measured<00:00:08.940> six<00:00:09.420> inches<00:00:09.809> above<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
that's measured six inches above the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.180 
that's measured six inches above the
soil<00:00:10.500> line<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.250> let's<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.580> this

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
soil line so let's do this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.039 
soil line so let's do this
six<00:00:14.190> inches<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.210> there's<00:00:15.420> approximately

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
six inches we know there's approximately

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
six inches we know there's approximately
more<00:00:16.199> than<00:00:16.260> an<00:00:16.470> edge<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.760> we'll<00:00:18.119> just

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
more than an edge here so we'll just

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.810 
more than an edge here so we'll just
measure<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:19.260> cup<00:00:25.130> broadcast<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.400> over

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
measure out one cup broadcast it over

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.500 
measure out one cup broadcast it over
the<00:00:26.939> soil<00:00:27.150> surface<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:31.880> like<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> little

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the soil surface I like to use a little

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.290 
the soil surface I like to use a little
more<00:00:34.219> since<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.610> organic<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.120> it's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
more since we know it's organic and it's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.130 
more since we know it's organic and it's
safe<00:00:36.510> now<00:00:37.850> you'll<00:00:38.850> notice<00:00:39.180> there's<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.840> bird

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
safe now you'll notice there's a bird

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
safe now you'll notice there's a bird
around<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> fruit<00:00:41.129> tree<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.730> great

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
around the fruit tree this is great

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.760 
around the fruit tree this is great
because<00:00:42.840> they'll<00:00:42.989> help<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> keep<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
because they'll help to keep all the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
because they'll help to keep all the
water<00:00:44.000> just<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> root<00:00:45.539> zone<00:00:45.570> where<00:00:45.989> you'll

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
water just in the root zone where you'll

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.790 
water just in the root zone where you'll
need<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.410> most

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
need it the most

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440 
need it the most
especially<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.399> trees<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.670> young<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.210> they

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
especially when trees are young and they

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.830 
especially when trees are young and they
could<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.809> benefit<00:00:49.379> from<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> water

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
could really benefit from the water

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.799 
could really benefit from the water
take<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:51.989> cultivator<00:00:53.510> just<00:00:54.510> lightly

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
take your cultivator just lightly

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
take your cultivator just lightly
scratch<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> fertilizer<00:00:55.920> into<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> soil

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
scratch the fertilizer into the soil

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:07.960 
scratch the fertilizer into the soil
just<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.329> this

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.679 

very<00:01:08.970> simple

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.910 

did<00:01:13.259> he<00:01:13.350> take<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.920> watering<00:01:14.399> wand<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.770> like<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
did he take you watering wand I like the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.609 
did he take you watering wand I like the
showerhead<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.390> hence<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.840> mix<00:01:19.469> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
showerhead because it's hence to mix the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.819 
showerhead because it's hence to mix the
fertilizer<00:01:20.100> into<00:01:20.579> the<00:01:20.850> soil<00:01:21.149> which<00:01:21.840> evenly

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
fertilizer into the soil which evenly

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.560 
fertilizer into the soil which evenly
distributes<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> fertilizer<00:01:24.180> throughout

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
distributes the fertilizer throughout

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.779 
distributes the fertilizer throughout
the<00:01:24.720> entire<00:01:24.960> soil<00:01:25.289> surface<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.399> makes<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
the entire soil surface this makes it

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.660 
the entire soil surface this makes it
really<00:01:27.119> easy<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:30.920> by<00:01:31.920> having<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.429> burbs

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
really easy and by having the burbs

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
really easy and by having the burbs
built<00:01:33.299> around<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> always<00:01:34.229> keeps<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
built around it it always keeps the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.309 
built around it it always keeps the
water<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.429> where<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.939> need<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.960> tree<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
water just where you need this tree is

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.080 
water just where you need this tree is
about<00:01:37.560> four<00:01:37.890> years<00:01:38.039> old<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.850> been<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
about four years old and it's been in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
about four years old and it's been in
the<00:01:39.179> ground<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.350> year<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.909> want

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the ground for about one year so we want

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.230 
the ground for about one year so we want
to<00:01:42.179> make<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.780> keep<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> nice<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.350> moist

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
to make sure we keep it nice and moist

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
to make sure we keep it nice and moist
probably<00:01:45.240> once<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.630> week<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.799> want<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.069> use

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
probably once a week and you want to use

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.919 
probably once a week and you want to use
a<00:01:47.189> fertilizer<00:01:47.759> once<00:01:48.420> every<00:01:48.689> two<00:01:48.899> months

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
a fertilizer once every two months

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.760 
a fertilizer once every two months
especially<00:01:49.709> during<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.099> growing<00:01:50.340> season

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
especially during the growing season

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.050 
especially during the growing season
once<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> feel<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.159> you've<00:01:53.459> watered<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.939> in

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
once you feel that you've watered it in

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.029 
once you feel that you've watered it in
thoroughly<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.200> use<00:01:58.380> probably<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
thoroughly and this can use probably a

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.429 
thoroughly and this can use probably a
couple<00:01:59.369> more<00:01:59.520> minutes<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.970> watering<00:02:00.439> but

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
couple more minutes of watering but

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.080 
couple more minutes of watering but
essentially<00:02:02.069> this<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.849> do<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:02.970> see

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
essentially this is it what do you see

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
essentially this is it what do you see
the<00:02:03.240> water<00:02:03.420> getting<00:02:04.380> us<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:05.009> near<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the water getting us to just near the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.319 
the water getting us to just near the
very<00:02:06.299> top<00:02:06.599> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.399> rim<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:09.149> you've<00:02:09.299> done

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329 
very top of the rim you know you've done

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.720 
very top of the rim you know you've done
your<00:02:09.509> job<00:02:09.769> good<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.549> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
your job good you don't have to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.140 
your job good you don't have to
fertilize<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.360> for<00:02:12.540> another<00:02:12.720> two<00:02:12.989> months
