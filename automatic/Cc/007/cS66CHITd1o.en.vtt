our<00:00:05.339> series<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.819> RNA<00:00:06.150> viruses<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:07.379> this

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
our series on RNA viruses with this

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.169 
our series on RNA viruses with this
video<00:00:08.130> it's<00:00:08.519> gonna<00:00:08.639> be<00:00:08.880> about<00:00:09.030> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
video it's gonna be about the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.589 
video it's gonna be about the
paramyxovirus<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:11.700> here's<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.969> list<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.360> all

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
paramyxovirus so here's a list of all

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.079 
paramyxovirus so here's a list of all
the<00:00:12.750> RNA<00:00:13.080> enveloped<00:00:13.590> viruses<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.490> we're

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the RNA enveloped viruses and we're

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.689 
the RNA enveloped viruses and we're
gonna<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.360> working<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.690> paramyxovirus<00:00:16.609> so<00:00:17.609> I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
gonna be working on paramyxovirus so I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.260 
gonna be working on paramyxovirus so I
wrote<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.180> para<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.750> Em's<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.970> if<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.090> look

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
wrote here para of Em's and if you look

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.560 
wrote here para of Em's and if you look
at<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.560> first<00:00:22.590> five<00:00:23.340> letters<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.420> you

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
at this the first five letters here you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.679 
at this the first five letters here you
see<00:00:24.779> para<00:00:25.140> em<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> pair<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.640> Em's<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.570> what

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
see para em so a pair of Em's is what

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.109 
see para em so a pair of Em's is what
I'm<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.760> we're<00:00:30.029> gonna

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
I'm going for on this one so we're gonna

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.990 
I'm going for on this one so we're gonna
have<00:00:30.449> mumps<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.080> measles<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.920> part<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> this

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
have mumps and measles as part of this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.209 
have mumps and measles as part of this
discussion<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> help<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
discussion so that's just to help you

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
discussion so that's just to help you
remember<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.820> measles<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.200> mumps<00:00:37.350> fall

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
remember that measles and mumps fall

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.340 
remember that measles and mumps fall
within<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:39.890> virus<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.820> we're<00:00:42.090> gonna<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.510> talk

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
within that virus so we're gonna do talk

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.779 
within that virus so we're gonna do talk
about<00:00:43.379> these<00:00:43.770> different<00:00:44.040> ones<00:00:44.430> we've<00:00:44.640> got

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
about these different ones we've got

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.979 
about these different ones we've got
parainfluenza<00:00:45.350> virus<00:00:46.670> RSV<00:00:47.809> mumps<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
parainfluenza virus RSV mumps and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.029 
parainfluenza virus RSV mumps and
measles<00:00:49.050> also<00:00:49.890> known<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.160> robiola<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.890> when<00:00:52.890> we

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
measles also known as robiola so when we

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.549 
measles also known as robiola so when we
talk<00:00:53.430> about<00:00:53.460> parainfluenza<00:00:54.020> virus<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.230> don't

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
talk about parainfluenza virus i don't

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
talk about parainfluenza virus i don't
want<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> confuse<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.670> ortho<00:00:57.329> Mixel

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
want you to confuse it with ortho Mixel

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
want you to confuse it with ortho Mixel
virus<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.469> an<00:00:58.620> easy<00:00:58.800> thing<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.190> do

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
virus which is an easy thing to do

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.840 
virus which is an easy thing to do
because<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> names<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.690> similar<00:01:01.020> so

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
because the names are so similar so

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
because the names are so similar so
ortho<00:01:02.850> Mixel<00:01:03.180> virus<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> be

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
ortho Mixel virus is going to be

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.940 
ortho Mixel virus is going to be
influenza<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.979> para<00:01:06.290> influenza<00:01:07.290> virus<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
influenza and para influenza virus is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.310 
influenza and para influenza virus is
going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.189> part<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.430> paramyxovirus<00:01:09.320> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
going to be part of paramyxovirus so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.690 
going to be part of paramyxovirus so
you'll<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.619> sometimes<00:01:11.310> they'll<00:01:11.580> get

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you'll get sometimes they'll get

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.320 
you'll get sometimes they'll get
questions<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.830> will<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.970> answer

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
questions that will in the answer

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.800 
questions that will in the answer
choices<00:01:15.360> you'll<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.580> your<00:01:17.630> influenza<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
choices you'll have your influenza and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
choices you'll have your influenza and
parrot<00:01:19.140> influenza<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:19.920> ortho<00:01:20.850> mix<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.210> virus

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
parrot influenza or ortho mix with virus

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
parrot influenza or ortho mix with virus
and<00:01:21.720> paramyxovirus<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> make

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and paramyxovirus so you got to make

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
and paramyxovirus so you got to make
sure<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> good<00:01:25.170> handle<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
sure that you have a good handle on the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.770 
sure that you have a good handle on the
difference<00:01:26.369> between<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.820> two<00:01:27.000> selenium<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
difference between the two selenium you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
difference between the two selenium you
don't<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.049> confused<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.920> those<00:01:29.100> types<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
don't get confused on those types of

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.210 
don't get confused on those types of
questions<00:01:32.180> okay<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.320> paramyxovirus<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
questions okay so the paramyxovirus is

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.990 
questions okay so the paramyxovirus is
gonna<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.689> single-stranded<00:01:36.689> RNA<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.220> for

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
gonna be single-stranded RNA and for

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
gonna be single-stranded RNA and for
this<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.329> we're<00:01:39.509> gonna<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
this one we're gonna go with the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.160 
this one we're gonna go with the
paratroopers<00:01:41.009> theme<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.840> we're<00:01:42.960> gonna<00:01:43.049> use

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
paratroopers theme so we're gonna use

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.440 
paratroopers theme so we're gonna use
paratroopers<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.220> our<00:01:44.369> memory<00:01:44.670> aid<00:01:44.880> because

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
paratroopers as our memory aid because

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.840 
paratroopers as our memory aid because
the<00:01:46.790> name<00:01:47.790> starts<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.299> para<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.850> even

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the name starts with para and so even

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.999 
the name starts with para and so even
though<00:01:51.000> paratroopers<00:01:51.750> are<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.079> teams<00:01:52.500> they

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
though paratroopers are in teams they

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
though paratroopers are in teams they
jump<00:01:53.369> alone<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.600> we're<00:01:54.689> gonna<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
jump alone and so we're gonna use that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.359 
jump alone and so we're gonna use that
to<00:01:55.470> remember<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
to remember that this is a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.569 
to remember that this is a
single-stranded<00:01:57.329> RNA<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.979> also<00:01:59.219> notice

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
single-stranded RNA and then also notice

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.880 
single-stranded RNA and then also notice
they<00:01:59.909> are<00:01:59.939> not<00:02:00.090> segmented<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
they are not segmented because that's a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.690 
they are not segmented because that's a
special<00:02:02.310> train<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.729> influenza<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:05.430> would<00:02:05.549> be

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
special train of influenza that would be

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.740 
special train of influenza that would be
another<00:02:06.090> great<00:02:07.049> question<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.970> test<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
another great question on a test you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.520 
another great question on a test you
know<00:02:10.050> asking<00:02:10.830> about<00:02:11.039> which

know asking about which
viruses<00:02:13.040> have<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> segment<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.940> DNA<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.540> you

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
viruses have a segment of DNA and you

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.040 
viruses have a segment of DNA and you
can<00:02:15.190> definitely<00:02:16.190> count<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:17.240> parainfluenza

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
can definitely count on parainfluenza

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.500 
can definitely count on parainfluenza

and influence of both being in the
answer<00:02:20.870> choices<00:02:21.640> okay<00:02:22.640> since<00:02:22.880> this

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
answer choices okay since this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.090 
answer choices okay since this
deformation<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> word<00:02:24.920> you'll

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
deformation this is a word you'll

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100 
deformation this is a word you'll
probably<00:02:25.370> see<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> lot<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.060> your<00:02:26.180> studies<00:02:26.569> since

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
probably see a lot in your studies since

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.979 
probably see a lot in your studies since
YCJA<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.760> means<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.090> they<00:02:29.209> induce<00:02:29.600> cells

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
YCJA that means that they induce cells

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.380 
YCJA that means that they induce cells
to<00:02:30.319> form<00:02:30.560> multinucleated<00:02:31.520> giant<00:02:31.580> cells<00:02:31.940> that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
to form multinucleated giant cells that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.830 
to form multinucleated giant cells that
clump<00:02:32.720> together<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.750> multinucleated<00:02:35.750> giant

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
clump together so multinucleated giant

back to the paratroopers memory aid

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.699 
back to the paratroopers memory aid
remember<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.250> paratroopers<00:02:46.820> are<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.150> teams

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
remember that paratroopers are in teams

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.949 
remember that paratroopers are in teams
so<00:02:48.709> they<00:02:49.040> stick<00:02:49.430> together<00:02:49.640> but<00:02:50.600> then<00:02:50.810> they

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
so they stick together but then they

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.140 
so they stick together but then they
jump<00:02:51.290> alone<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.640> reminds<00:02:53.030> us<00:02:53.120> that

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
jump alone and that reminds us that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.520 
jump alone and that reminds us that
they're<00:02:53.420> single<00:02:53.840> strand<00:02:54.170> RNA<00:02:56.140> you're<00:02:57.140> moving

you'd<00:03:27.769> have<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.010> know<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.250> that's<00:03:28.340> parrot

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
you'd have to know that that's parrot

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.680 
you'd have to know that that's parrot
influenza<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:30.519> there's<00:03:31.519> no<00:03:31.700> antiviral

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.210 

okay<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:43.940> we're<00:03:44.209> moving<00:03:44.299> on<00:03:44.480> RSV<00:03:45.200> also<00:03:46.040> known

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
okay so we're moving on RSV also known

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.240 
okay so we're moving on RSV also known
as<00:03:46.420> respiratory<00:03:47.420> syncytial<00:03:47.810> virus<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.980> here

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
as respiratory syncytial virus so here

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.210 
as respiratory syncytial virus so here
we<00:03:49.340> see<00:03:49.579> that<00:03:49.730> word<00:03:49.940> against<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.510> Sissel<00:03:51.220> so

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
we see that word against and Sissel so

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.979 
we see that word against and Sissel so
