sweaters that are too tight or bulky

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.080

because<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.400> might<00:01:29.520> show<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:29.790> too<00:01:29.939> many

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
because we might show off too many

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
because we might show off too many
curves<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> great<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
curves but this one is great because it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.249 
curves but this one is great because it
has<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> tight<00:01:32.490> waist<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.689> loser<00:01:34.110> at

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
has a tight waist and then this loser at

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800 
has a tight waist and then this loser at
the<00:01:34.380> top<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> creates<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> illusion<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the top so it creates the illusion and I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
the top so it creates the illusion and I
gives<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.320> slim<00:01:37.710> figure<00:01:38.150> you<00:01:39.150> can
