00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 the farm ministry announced this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 week tax increases for 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.099
 gasoline and diesel the price of gasoline 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.309
 may increase by 22 cents and 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.770
 diesel oil of 15 cents per liter 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.109
 the measure did not please the merchant a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.090
 minute that went through a bid in the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.789
 At least twenty-two cents I believe 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.670
 if I went more consumers are already 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.439
 finding the prices high and now the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 situation gets even more complicated 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 it's bad for everyone and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.390
 especially for people who are living the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.980
 here it points 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 Why do you think that people who 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 is taking things all the government 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 announced the readjustment of the peg 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 confines and the return of the cide charge 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.340
 on fuels at high prices 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.829
 of pumps for the consumer 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.700
 now will depend on determining the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 stations 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.289
 The announcement of the possible increase 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 pleased consumers 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.820
 I think the game is so difficult right now 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.920
 commented thus the economy is stopping 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 every day every day more is going to be 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.600
 very hard you will not if you go 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.479
 complicate more will become more expensive 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 All in truth, do not mention carolina. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.200
 long hard 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240
 everything is increasing the people's salary 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.259
 the same purchasing power 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.290
 less time 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.509
 the merchants are also worried 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.110
 with the low movement in the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.590
 Target fuels will fall to 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.000
 How far can they go? 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.310
 I want to ensure safe after that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.430
 with this custom even the procon guides 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.439
 that the driver is aware of the price and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.579
 that the increase has not yet been 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.060
 authorized 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.979
 if the customer perceives abusive prices 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 should contact the organs of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.970
 consumer protection and may even 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 make a complaint to the defense 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.079
 of the consumer such as procon 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.860
 so we can be checking 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.020
 abusive practice in agreement or 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.990
 disagreement with the table practiced in the month 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.540
 guidance is always the same 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.120
 search and this can make a great 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.100
 defense 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.630
 thinks in the consumer's pocket we have 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.640
 research available that together with the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.550
 procon so that the person can see that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.470
 There are differences, the differences are 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.210
 valuable are so significant the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 consumer may be taking advantage of this 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.500
 this difference
