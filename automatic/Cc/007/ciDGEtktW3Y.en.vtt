then they come on Thanksgiving and what

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.960 
then they come on Thanksgiving and what
you<00:00:44.380> do<00:00:44.560> is<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.890> leave<00:00:45.040> out<00:00:45.190> crackers<00:00:45.730> and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
you do is you leave out crackers and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.940 
you do is you leave out crackers and
water<00:00:46.150> and<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.930> reason<00:00:47.170> why<00:00:47.290> that<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.770> because

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
water and the reason why that is because

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.140 
water and the reason why that is because
um<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:49.180> crackers<00:00:49.750> remind<00:00:50.500> them<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:51.150> crunching

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
um the crackers remind them of crunching

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.610 
um the crackers remind them of crunching
snow<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.960> then<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.680> water<00:00:53.980> reminds<00:00:54.730> them<00:00:55.270> of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
snow and then the water reminds them of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.590 
snow and then the water reminds them of
melted<00:00:56.620> snow<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.790> if<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.090> don't<00:00:58.180> leave<00:00:58.390> that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
melted snow so if you don't leave that

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
melted snow so if you don't leave that
out<00:00:58.780> they<00:00:58.989> don't<00:00:59.110> come<00:00:59.440> so<00:01:00.430> um<00:01:01.380> you<00:01:02.380> have<00:01:02.500> to

out they don't come so um you have to
leave<00:01:02.770> that<00:01:02.890> out<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.340> then<00:01:03.839> every<00:01:04.839> single

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
leave that out and then every single
