reef yup Bam Bam Bam of course this was
shot<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.250> swimming<00:01:04.640> pool<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:05.510> can

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.940 
up regulated there and now she has to
pull<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:27.800> out<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.420> again<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:29.960> just<00:01:29.990> you

this extreme scuba make of them this is

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.040 
this extreme scuba make of them this is
the<00:01:40.580> types<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:41.030> skills<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.570> would<00:01:41.660> have<00:01:41.840> as<00:01:42.020> a

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
the types of skills that would have as a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.580 
the types of skills that would have as a
diver<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:43.030> asked<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.120> to<00:01:44.240> go<00:01:44.420> ahead<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.050> clear

diver I asked it to go ahead and clear
that<00:01:45.800> mask<00:01:46.130> for<00:01:46.520> us<00:01:46.610> because<00:01:46.730> I<00:01:46.850> know<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.090> was

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
that mask for us because I know this was

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.030 
that mask for us because I know this was
a<00:01:47.240> really<00:01:47.480> tough<00:01:47.780> one<00:01:47.960> for<00:01:48.230> her<00:01:48.380> in<00:01:48.950> the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
a really tough one for her in the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.010 
a really tough one for her in the
beginning<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:50.120> can<00:01:50.270> see<00:01:50.450> yeah<00:01:50.660> she

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
beginning and you can see yeah she

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.870 
beginning and you can see yeah she
clears<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.650> then<00:01:51.860> she<00:01:51.980> chokes<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.790> know

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
clears it and then she chokes you know

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880 
clears it and then she chokes you know
she's<00:01:53.150> choking<00:01:53.420> on<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.870> water<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.350> know<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
she's choking on the water you know and

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.310 
she's choking on the water you know and
that's<00:01:55.400> again<00:01:55.760> because<00:01:56.150> she<00:01:56.660> was<00:01:56.780> looking<00:01:57.110> up

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
that's again because she was looking up

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.930 
that's again because she was looking up
as<00:01:57.560> we're<00:01:57.770> gonna<00:01:57.920> see<00:01:58.220> later<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
as we're gonna see later on in the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.600 
as we're gonna see later on in the
program<00:01:59.290> and<00:02:00.290> then<00:02:00.440> of<00:02:00.590> course<00:02:00.650> I<00:02:01.100> gather<00:02:01.370> her

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
program and then of course I gather her

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.520 
program and then of course I gather her
and<00:02:01.760> have<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.120> remove<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.810> replace<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.140> mask

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
and have a remove and replace the mask

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.160 
and have a remove and replace the mask
this<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.520> skill<00:02:04.910> for<00:02:05.120> her<00:02:05.300> that's<00:02:05.540> been<00:02:05.720> very

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
coming into the program with these

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.380 
coming into the program with these
skills<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.500> know<00:02:28.010> Mitch<00:02:28.280> we<00:02:28.520> see<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> gang<00:02:29.240> and

the<00:02:31.850> leaf<00:02:32.000> bouncing<00:02:32.420> notice<00:02:32.960> how<00:02:33.110> full<00:02:33.530> her<00:02:33.560> BC

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
the leaf bouncing notice how full her BC

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.650 
the leaf bouncing notice how full her BC
is<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.550> never<00:02:34.790> noticed<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.210> before

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
is I never noticed that before

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.410 
is I never noticed that before
just<00:02:36.260> how<00:02:36.680> much<00:02:36.830> gas<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.760> BC<00:02:38.240> it's

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
just how much gas is in that BC it's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.840 
just how much gas is in that BC it's
amazing<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.410> before<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:39.950> great<00:02:40.370> video

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
amazing so this before is a great video

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.090 
amazing so this before is a great video
so<00:02:46.180> after<00:02:47.180> about<00:02:47.390> two<00:02:47.630> hours<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.590> ESM

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
so after about two hours of the ESM

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.760 
so after about two hours of the ESM
program<00:02:49.760> we<00:02:50.450> worked<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.930> all<00:02:51.140> those<00:02:51.350> different

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
program we worked on all those different

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.980 
program we worked on all those different
things<00:02:51.800> let's<00:02:52.340> take<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.520> look<00:02:52.910> at<00:02:53.060> Mary<00:02:53.300> now<00:02:53.630> one

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
things let's take a look at Mary now one

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.020 
things let's take a look at Mary now one
of<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.200> things<00:02:54.500> we<00:02:54.770> see<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.790> she

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
of the things we see here is she

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.790 
of the things we see here is she
starting<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.480> do<00:02:56.630> some<00:02:56.810> frog<00:02:57.230> kicks<00:02:57.530> and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
starting to do some frog kicks and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.860 
starting to do some frog kicks and
that's<00:02:57.950> really<00:02:58.670> dramatically<00:02:59.240> different<00:02:59.569> as

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
that's really dramatically different as

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.140 
that's really dramatically different as
you<00:02:59.900> notice<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.740> water<00:03:01.040> actually<00:03:01.730> instead

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
you notice that water actually instead

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.120 
you notice that water actually instead
of<00:03:02.209> being<00:03:02.300> kicked<00:03:02.690> down<00:03:02.870> towards<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.920> reef

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
of being kicked down towards the reef

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.400 
of being kicked down towards the reef
from<00:03:04.310> her<00:03:04.520> smashing<00:03:05.209> on<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.540> reef<00:03:05.690> you

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
from her smashing on the reef you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.630 
from her smashing on the reef you
actually<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.890> waters<00:03:07.220> been<00:03:07.370> kicked

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
actually the waters been kicked

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.490 
actually the waters been kicked
backwards<00:03:08.090> yeah<00:03:08.569> we<00:03:08.720> see<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> little<00:03:09.200> bit<00:03:09.380> of

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
backwards yeah we see a little bit of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.290 
backwards yeah we see a little bit of
beginnings<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.220> helicopter<00:03:10.700> terms<00:03:11.090> that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
beginnings of a helicopter terms that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.210 
beginnings of a helicopter terms that
she's<00:03:11.420> able<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.750> turn<00:03:12.110> without<00:03:12.319> using<00:03:13.069> on

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
she's able to turn without using on

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.780 
she's able to turn without using on
hands<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.360> an<00:03:14.510> amazing<00:03:15.080> skill<00:03:15.580> now<00:03:16.580> we're

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
hands it's an amazing skill now we're

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.640 
hands it's an amazing skill now we're
looking<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.209> true<00:03:17.690> me<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.080> really<00:03:18.410> see<00:03:18.620> a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
looking at a true me and I really see a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.400 
looking at a true me and I really see a
big<00:03:19.000> improvement<00:03:20.000> in<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.209> profile<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
big improvement in a profile to the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.280 
big improvement in a profile to the
water<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.069> that<00:03:22.099> she's<00:03:22.400> not<00:03:22.569> plowing<00:03:23.569> anymore

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
water so that she's not plowing anymore

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.750 
water so that she's not plowing anymore
and<00:03:24.410> she's<00:03:24.500> not<00:03:24.650> kicking<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.250> bottom<00:03:25.610> up

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
and she's not kicking the bottom up

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.330 
and she's not kicking the bottom up
she's<00:03:26.240> actually<00:03:26.450> got<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.170> very<00:03:27.680> very<00:03:27.950> good

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
she's actually got that very very good

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.680 
she's actually got that very very good
trim<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:29.060> we're<00:03:29.180> looking<00:03:29.270> for<00:03:29.599> that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
trim that we're looking for that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.190 
trim that we're looking for that
streamline<00:03:30.610> prone<00:03:31.610> position<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:32.990> see

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
streamline prone position and you see

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.380 
streamline prone position and you see
the<00:03:33.349> water<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:33.800> backwards<00:03:34.730> now<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.209> she's

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
the water going backwards now as she's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.870 
the water going backwards now as she's
kicking<00:03:35.660> along<00:03:36.250> take<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.370> look<00:03:37.520> at<00:03:37.610> some<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.760> the
