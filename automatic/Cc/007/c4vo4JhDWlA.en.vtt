this video is about a field pressure
gauge<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.980> installed<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.189> fuel<00:00:20.699> pressure<00:00:20.910> gauge

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.340 
gauge I installed my fuel pressure gauge
directly<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> air<00:00:23.039> dog<00:00:23.340> line<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:25.199> can

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
directly into the air dog line you can

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.570 
directly into the air dog line you can
see<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.330> right<00:00:27.330> down<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:28.039> just<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.189> standard

tee fitting half-inch runs the line all
the<00:00:34.140> way<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:36.140> kind<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.640> diaphragm

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the way up to this kind of a diaphragm

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.810 
the way up to this kind of a diaphragm
system<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.590> diesel<00:00:40.890> fuel<00:00:41.040> goes<00:00:41.219> into<00:00:41.550> right

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
system the diesel fuel goes into right

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.410 
system the diesel fuel goes into right
here<00:00:42.500> from<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.980> had<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> buy<00:00:44.879> some<00:00:45.180> extra

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
here from there I had to buy some extra

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.529 
here from there I had to buy some extra
fittings<00:00:45.629> because<00:00:46.760> Gino's<00:00:47.760> garage<00:00:48.090> didn't

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
fittings because Gino's garage didn't

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.740 
fittings because Gino's garage didn't
they<00:00:49.140> thought<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.710> supplied<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.670> line<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
they thought they supplied the line that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350 
they thought they supplied the line that
goes<00:00:51.870> straight<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.730> injection<00:00:53.730> pump<00:00:54.090> but

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
goes straight to the injection pump but

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
goes straight to the injection pump but
I<00:00:54.629> wasn't<00:00:55.289> doing<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I wasn't doing that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
I wasn't doing that
so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.660> ran<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:58.649> standard<00:00:59.039> antifreeze<00:00:59.660> into

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so I ran just standard antifreeze into

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.990 
so I ran just standard antifreeze into
the<00:01:00.750> cab<00:01:01.039> through<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:03.409> little<00:01:04.409> hole<00:01:05.000> into

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the cab through your little hole into

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840 
the cab through your little hole into
the<00:01:06.210> firewall<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.670> where<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> could

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the firewall right there where you could

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.420 
the firewall right there where you could
run<00:01:08.970> anything<00:01:09.270> pretty<00:01:09.930> much

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
run anything pretty much

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.950 
run anything pretty much
alright<00:01:11.430> let's<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> truck<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.800 

installed<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> gauge<00:01:16.729> right<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.180> my<00:01:18.479> lower

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
installed the gauge right to my lower

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
installed the gauge right to my lower
side<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.920> fit<00:01:23.130> pretty<00:01:23.280> nicely<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.939> out

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
side and it fit pretty nicely it's out

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.429 
side and it fit pretty nicely it's out
of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> pedals<00:01:24.509> away<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.350> in

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
of the pedals away it's not really in

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.770 
of the pedals away it's not really in
the<00:01:25.530> way<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.280> wired<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:29.780> dimmer

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the way at all I wired it to my dimmer

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.649 
the way at all I wired it to my dimmer
switch<00:01:31.490> I've<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.700> wire<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
switch I've one wire going right to a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.670 
switch I've one wire going right to a
ground<00:01:34.579> spot<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.509> underneath<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> dash

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
ground spot in the underneath the dash

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.069 
ground spot in the underneath the dash
and<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.729> had<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.640> direct<00:01:42.390> wire<00:01:42.659> into

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and I had this going it direct wire into

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.380 
and I had this going it direct wire into
the<00:01:43.170> number<00:01:43.409> five<00:01:43.439> slot<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.759> controls<00:01:45.149> your

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the number five slot it controls your

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.660 
the number five slot it controls your

lights<00:01:47.820> go<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.390> gauge<00:01:49.079> turns<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.790> I'll

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
lights go on the gauge turns on I'll

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:01.930 
lights go on the gauge turns on I'll
show<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.180> feel<00:01:51.899> pressure<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.470> it
