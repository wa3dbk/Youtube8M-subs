oncology<00:00:18.119> massage<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.140> really

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
oncology massage I think is really

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.279 
oncology massage I think is really
twofold<00:00:19.830> how<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.820> adjust<00:00:20.910> massage<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.140> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
twofold how do we adjust massage so that

twofold how do we adjust massage so that
it<00:00:22.380> doesn't<00:00:22.680> cause<00:00:22.830> harm<00:00:23.029> but<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> think<00:00:24.300> when

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
it doesn't cause harm but I think when

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.029 
it doesn't cause harm but I think when
we<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.199> get<00:00:25.350> down<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.740> oncology

less<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.399> mechanics<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.090> more<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.420> presence

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
less on mechanics and more on presence

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
less on mechanics and more on presence
and<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.890> oncology<00:01:47.460> massage<00:01:47.579> it's
