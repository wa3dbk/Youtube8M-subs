ace of spades is so dynamic it's never
like<00:00:23.350> for<00:00:23.620> example<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:24.250> same<00:00:24.490> map<00:00:24.790> it'll

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
like for example the same map it'll

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.090 
like for example the same map it'll
always<00:00:25.480> change<00:00:25.870> on<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.230> spot<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:26.800> means

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
always change on the spot and that means

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.560 
always change on the spot and that means
there's<00:00:27.610> so<00:00:27.730> many<00:00:27.820> different<00:00:28.150> tactics<00:00:28.270> so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
concept to me I'd heared about it I saw

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.440 
concept to me I'd heared about it I saw
on<00:00:38.800> YouTube<00:00:39.010> clips<00:00:39.520> but<00:00:39.790> I<00:00:39.820> had<00:00:40.059> never<00:00:40.330> played

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
on YouTube clips but I had never played

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.470 
on YouTube clips but I had never played

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
it lifted it and I loved it

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.250 
it lifted it and I loved it
pretty<00:00:43.780> cool<00:00:44.020> to<00:00:44.050> be<00:00:44.260> honest

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
pretty cool to be honest

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
pretty cool to be honest
we<00:00:46.710> haven't<00:00:46.950> had<00:00:47.070> an<00:00:47.250> empty<00:00:47.520> seat<00:00:47.700> really<00:00:47.910> at

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
we haven't had an empty seat really at

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.639 
we haven't had an empty seat really at
any<00:00:48.270> point<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.780> day<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.170> far<00:00:49.200> it's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
any point in the day so far it's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.049 
any point in the day so far it's
actually<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.160> hard<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> get<00:00:50.579> people<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
actually really hard to get people to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.650 
actually really hard to get people to
stop<00:00:51.300> playing<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:52.079> people<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.470> buy<00:00:52.650> it

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
stop playing it so more people do buy it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.049 
stop playing it so more people do buy it

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
what classes to pick why we should pick

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.559 
what classes to pick why we should pick
them<00:01:20.140> my<00:01:20.799> favorite<00:01:21.130> class<00:01:21.310> was<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.700> Martin

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
them my favorite class was the Martin

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.020 
them my favorite class was the Martin
I<00:01:22.600> enjoyed<00:01:23.049> that<00:01:23.259> we<00:01:23.979> love<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.429> destructible

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
I enjoyed that we love the destructible

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.880 
I enjoyed that we love the destructible
terrain<00:01:25.179> being<00:01:25.780> able<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.990> build<00:01:26.170> things<00:01:26.289> just

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
terrain being able to build things just

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.529 
terrain being able to build things just
running<00:01:27.159> around<00:01:27.250> generally<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.179> had<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.329> good

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
running around generally just had a good

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.719 
running around generally just had a good
life<00:01:28.750> playing<00:01:29.110> together<00:01:29.319> what<00:01:29.979> really<00:01:30.310> was

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
life playing together what really was

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.429 
life playing together what really was
good<00:01:31.000> was<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> commander<00:01:31.869> just<00:01:32.020> blowing

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
good was the commander just blowing

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.410 
good was the commander just blowing
everything<00:01:32.619> cool<00:01:33.280> any<00:01:33.579> structures<00:01:34.179> that<00:01:34.299> were

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
everything cool any structures that were

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.730 
everything cool any structures that were
there<00:01:36.840> I've<00:01:37.840> seen<00:01:38.049> people<00:01:38.319> who<00:01:38.409> put<00:01:38.590> more

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
there I've seen people who put more

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.410 
there I've seen people who put more
experimental<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:39.819> though<00:01:39.969> they'll<00:01:40.299> go

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
experimental so though they'll go

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.880 
experimental so though they'll go
through<00:01:40.450> all<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.810> classes<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.259> they'll<00:01:41.590> work

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
through all the classes and they'll work

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.979 
through all the classes and they'll work
out<00:01:42.099> little<00:01:42.369> sneaky<00:01:42.700> ways<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.209> routes<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.840> go

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:43.989 
out little sneaky ways and routes to go

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:45.839 
out little sneaky ways and routes to go
and<00:01:44.349> how<00:01:44.739> they<00:01:44.920> can<00:01:45.069> dig<00:01:45.220> down<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.759> actually

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
and how they can dig down and actually

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.490 
and how they can dig down and actually
utilize<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.569> environment<00:01:47.079> around<00:01:47.140> them<00:01:47.349> and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
utilize the environment around them and

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.050 
utilize the environment around them and
then<00:01:47.619> you've<00:01:47.739> got<00:01:47.890> probably<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.670> more<00:01:48.849> typical

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
then you've got probably a more typical

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.850 
then you've got probably a more typical
and<00:01:49.539> yes<00:01:49.750> there<00:01:50.020> they'll<00:01:50.319> take<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.679> rights

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and yes there they'll take the rights

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.410 
and yes there they'll take the rights
and<00:01:51.189> they'll<00:01:51.280> find<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.640> high<00:01:51.759> point<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.239> just

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
and they'll find the high point and just

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.240 
and they'll find the high point and just
go<00:01:52.899> for<00:01:53.079> headshots<00:01:53.259> regardless<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.039> being<00:01:54.130> an

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
go for headshots regardless of being an
