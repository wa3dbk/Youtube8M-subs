00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello to all and all these bodies the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.959
 915 euros 14 how are you people 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.060
 me it's not too bad 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.329
 today we find ourselves for a tutorial 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
 rather fast and rather simple you 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.179
 go see it's going to be very easy I 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.599
 will teach you how to do a 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:30.320
 transition the simplest transition 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.820
 that exist so that's going to be a fade 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.699
 but we will add a little touch 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.470
 that the publishers like to clip 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.930
 do well when it comes to doing 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.820
 inclined say so you'll see it's 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.930
 very simple we will take two sequences 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.680
 video so this one is this one is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 just there hop we'll go slip so 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.050
 both on the same video track and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.390
 so we go the recessed ones in 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 the others so we will do like those 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 we'll do a little fade of two 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.989
 images or three images to you to see 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.470
 I 'm going to do three more is more 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.820
 cool hop like this so see it we have 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.659
 a fund of UBS years and it's very basic 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.250
 ok ok good to add a little 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.549
 little punch to this fade that remains 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 basic what I use when I 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.210
 do my clips since I do that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.680
 decline said i'm not going to go 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 look for transition very very 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.650
 complicated it's very simple I 'll see in 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.780
 panoramic and reframing events 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.420
 so here is I going to go to the end of the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.960
 first clip of the first sequence 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.600
 like this I'm going to make sure here so I 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.540
 am well at first I'm going backwards and so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.909
 of an image like this I'm going to create a 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.299
 point he's right here and then the no 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.409
 1 2 and I did a little zoom like 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.649
 this is this little zoom what we have to 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.810
 make 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.740
 not to make a check against the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.110
 copy on this key is so this point 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.850
 nothing is going to stick to them on the other side 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.150
 so does the same thing on the other side 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.950
 up 2 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.490
 hop we mix with slaps 1,2 and 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.930
 restore and so see I have my 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.820
 little transition like this except that i 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.500
 add a little bit of punch that allows 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.960
 to people who do not have a say 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.470
 not too many ideas level is said and that 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.510
 be it on call of duty battlefield 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.780
 social all type of editing in that it 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.100
 works on all types of montages it 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.380
 are effects that are more specific 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.300
 at some video games there these little 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.959
 transitions when you do not have too much 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.580
 ideas in mind 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.590
 she can save you more than once 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.630
 so you see if it's clean and says 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.430
 I recommend doing this after 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.430
 obviously you can could 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.150
 totally add how to say a 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.470
 prefabricated transition so for example 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.770
 if I take this I 'll go push the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.920
 halo to 1 like this but I'll you 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.570
 not recommend since since as the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.709
 fade is already there and there is the zoom 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.360
 behind I recommend you no 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:17.110
 add a prefabricated transition I 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.570
 am more what are you see we have this 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.350
 zoom zoom out it's nice it's 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.320
 fast and then that can save you 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.959
 case of if you're not inspired to 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.670
 the transitions that I hope these 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.800
 little this little trick earlier on 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.750
 will have helped you do not hesitate to comment 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.380
 to like and put in favorites it can 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.480
 make you happy 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.980

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.570
 tips safe sure sure tips for 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.519
 my finally to do some moviemaking of 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.440
 editing I know that there is a lot of 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.480
