00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.140
 or 1 friends from youtube I am from narÃ³n and 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.370
 I bring you here a new video tutorial 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.250
 how to make spirits tag the truth is 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.820
 this is very entertaining once 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.509
 you get hooked up, you're very entertaining 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.689
 since every time he says come and go 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.779
 making other own fringes good I'll 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.800
 cesc teach you how to track what you 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.800
 often time in competitions 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.410
 and good you have to start are 12 glasses there 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.410
 to start 36 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.140
 OK starting with the left 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.980
 where there are three steps 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.540
 is his 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.960
 and the one in his voice there are three I do not upload 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.420
 now there are two 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.050
 the second I pick it up and I put it to the rival and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.670
 well and then I remove it by putting the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:10.180
 up on the one on the right and the other one and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.330
 again I put and the other I return it to 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.480
 put good and now the 6 once 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.620
 we already do this 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:28.590
 now welcomes is three in each hand and you do 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:31.410
 you go up leaving in each hand two vouchers 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.380
 in theory you have them like this, take this one 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:41.270
 quickly turn leaving 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:46.549
 in table 2 then if you are right-handed you put 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.159
 on the left another you put it up with 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.250
 the right side you put on the other side and 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.259
 with the right you put it up it's worth and 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.539
 then to remove it is with the above 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.720
 you take the entire row on the right 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.720
 so then with the left hand 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.500
 you take 3 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:15.410
 yes, if you are left-handed, it would be the same 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.680
 only that through 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.299
 I'm right-handed, I do it right, I'm lame 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.269
 3 left each one on the table the one 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.380
 left I put it this up 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.850
 up and up is worth it 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:41.200
 moment I take it and as all is worth 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:44.440
 but it's worth we have the 3 and the 6 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.890
 now the one on the right is exactly 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.100
 Like this we take the put up 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.230
 and we make it worth it once you've already 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.630
 done this you have to remove everything 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.060
 OK 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.060
 that 's right stick 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.720
 So it's worth now once you've done it 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.390
 removed again the little ones were 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.610
 those that there are only three boards for 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.980
 make one of 6 this is the 6 that we have 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.890
 done before then now the boards and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.540
 you make an art one of 6 worth taking the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:26.140
 two and make one of 6 leaves 2 leave 2 in 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.290
 the table with the left put another the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.720
 from above the top and top is worth 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.220
 now with us we make another tower 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.220
 so it's worth 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.610
 so we take 3 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.720
 I go up leaving two on the table we put the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.400
 left 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.580
 the other one above the other one above and already 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.070
 we have the two mountains once we already 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:54.480
 we have this done we go back to the arch and 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:04:01.290
 then now you can choose or take this 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:04.840
 the Phillies stacked and well worth doing or 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.880
 you can also do it is a moment 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.580
 which is worth when the other pillars 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.209
 you can do that with these two 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.290
 you can tour or you can do it with your hand 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.330
 normal so like that and then you put everything 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.180
 point is worth as you prefer I do not land 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.410
 pick up the stick because then later you do not 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.050
 I have to put together but each one with 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.000
 want to be worth it once we've done the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.780
 of three the right of three we have 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.250
 taken away 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.580
 we have done the two of three down 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.729
 we unite all 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:46.310
 and we take two glasses one gets mouth 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:51.470
 down and another mouth up we take it 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:54.860
 there are five in each hand there are ten five in 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.020
 each hand and we do as we leave you two 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.060
 in the mass only that now we are going to give 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.850
 but it only remains as we are going to make a 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.850
 largest mountain 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.930
 we return we put them back on the table 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:13.009
 and we leave another two vale 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:17.300
 left here and then with the right 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:19.219
 if you are right - handed of the series in the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.999
 right leaves your hand in the middle and if you are 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:24.949
 with the other voucher but if you are left 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:31.839
 they do the same thing just the other way round 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:31.839
 first here and then here it's worth it 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.889
 to see five in each hand left in each 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.460
 table 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:48.270
 I leave on each table a 4 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.370
 I put up I put the other one as before 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.939
 we had put as we have put it in 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.029
 the medium before we put then is here 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:06:01.919
 two I still have 13 2 on the left and 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:04.020
 on the right or the other way round you put one here 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.860
 and another here in such a way that we put 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.490
 two and the last one above we already have a 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.930
 tower of four below is now worth the 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.069
 two glasses that we had left at 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.990
 principle we decompose everything as with the 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:22.860
 that you have on the right with that of the 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.069
 right you remove all this row then with 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:31.650
 the one on the left you remove the other row 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:35.000
 so the one on the right and this row 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.960
 with the following you remove the row 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.480
 here you have 5 and here 4 and you stay here 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.960
 still to dismantle a voucher what 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.340
 we have to do is the four 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.190
 you take only one 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.830
 and my taxi driver in such a way that 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:56.370
 we have three and three and now with the 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.800
 five we put in one's and it has already 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.310
 finished is valid and we also leave it like this 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.860
 for good to be able to return the good 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.400
 I hope you have served 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.600
 much and especially to practice the mountain 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.600
 large, which is the most expensive 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:18.740
 and good as always like comments 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.740
