00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 gift fighters my name is Mikhail and today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.670
 at the request of my subscribers, I do 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.670
 Reviewer on such a hardcore shooter as 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.670
 insurgency 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.460
 present to your attention the game 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.680
 channel jackpot thrice here you will find 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.810
 reviews on sharp skorgov and other 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.060
 game videos subscribe link in 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.400
 the description of this shooter learned 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.010
 quite a long time I remember back when 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.620
 he just came out such a foreign ububer 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.989
 how level cap did a review right after 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.239
 he went to other videos on the game 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 From other YouTube I many of them 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.800
 look, you know that the game is not me 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.589
 impressed I decided it was not worth spending 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.750
 this money but most recently in his 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.879
 group in contact I created your topic 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.129
 ideas and suggestions and you can 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.850
 suggest me a topic for a movie either 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.560
 some game and very many wrote 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.840
 panties insurgency I thought let's 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 let's try especially since the game was already in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.159
 I was not presented in the style of one of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.430
 subscribers and so I probably played 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.890
 20 minutes in the mode as far as I remember and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.470
 impression was terrifying game to me 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.930
 I didn't like it at all 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.509
 thought to know the roller 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.670
 anything else but still decided a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.149
 let me play and literally later 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.250
 an hour of play has adapted to you and started 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.110
 getting a certain fan what's from 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.719
 this should be the game in my opinion has 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.090
 quite high threshold of entry that is 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.700
 you can't literally start pulling 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.869
 half an hour later games like shooters 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.030
 heroes and generals 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.219
 which I recently reviewed for you 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.829
 will have to get used to the mechanics 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.259
 understand how everything works first you 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.729
 have to get used to fast death well 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.770
 or quick kill 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.869
 really in this respect insurgency 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.680
 perhaps the most hardcore shooter of those 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.320
 what i played 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.689
 for killing the enemy you can be conscious of being hit 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.460
 into the body like mechanics suggests 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.710
 neat and careful and style of play 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.350
 someone even on behind this imperial so 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.420
 that lovers of this scare shooter are unlikely 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.520
 Does it suit you at the end of the video ? 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.590
 see the moment 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.790
 when i made a hard break knocked out 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.160
 seven people in a row 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.770
 enemies obviously did not expect such accustomed 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.810
 that everything in this game is now from second 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.300
 you will have to get used to the minimum 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.460
 information that comes to you from 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.770
 interface that is there is no minimap 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.050
 the first servers on which I played even 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.420
 there was no homicide alert only 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.760
 then I found the server where it appears 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.130
 the gameplay with him you see now at home 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.630
 on the screen here is such a hardcore shooter 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.300
 this insurgency 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.430
 with its twist so to speak but there is 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.640
 him and their disadvantages pretty much a lot 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.280
 in my opinion again as in the case of 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.500
 heroes and card generals and this is the main 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.240
 the disadvantage of this game is actually 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.580
 doing reviews like this 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.830
 low budget insurgency shooters 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.560
 heroes and generals and so on I realized 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.340
 how important is map design creation 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.960
 shooters 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.370
 it's just one of the most important 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.110
 components 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.000
 this is what i like for example 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.970
 battlefield every card is perfect 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.760
 thought out with your face with your 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.910
 some highlights are just that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.900
 invested a lot of effort and effort and looking at 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.970
 cards insurgency think well, sometimes a cube 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.130
 Of course demand from low budget 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.680
 developing what are you supernatural 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.620
 nevertheless a drawback i highlight 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.630
 should it objectively for example on this 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.880
 The map gameplay you see was 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.240
 hard imbalance when we run away with 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.280
 its base is about 10 minutes in a row 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.209
 many shot some snyay Sam 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.180
 43 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.280
 which is not clear where he was sitting out of such 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.130
 to be in a shooter should not to you 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.320
 running out of the base could kill the enemy so 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.630
 way this fellow near stuffed a series 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.180
 out of 15 people but then he disappeared somewhere 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.459
 apparently either he was bored or his 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.130
 still someone also found periodically 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.070
 annoyed that you sometimes can not 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.350
 enter the door model characters 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.810
 so thick the door is so narrow 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.209
 what had to aim to 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.520
 enter it too in my opinion 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.829
 flaws map design well and most important 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.099
 the disadvantage for me personally is 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.259
 weak battle dynamics zarashit normal 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.169
 pretty hard and being can kill 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.330
 any stray bullet and sit in the corners it 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.539
 absolutely not my style and but I repeat 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.909
 This is my personal opinion is sure a lot 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.490
 like a similar style of play they consider 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.159
 what is it realistic as for 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.409
 the technical component of the game looks and 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.509
 played well I think you already understood 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.120
 on which engine it is created 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.550
 It is of course surs and playing it 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.940
 periodically there is a feeling of deja vu 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.400
 as if you are playing to is gold more 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.969
 hardcore version to out of the goal but all 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.340
 shortcomings and entities overlap one 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.789
 greatest dignity of this 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.319
 games 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.539
 namely, its price is only 350 rubles and 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.419
 if you wait for any discounts 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.300
 Seasons who can buy for 100 for so 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.819
 get a low price basically good 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.979
 pretty thoughtful shooter with her 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.039
 highlight so all lovers 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.199
 hardcore i highly recommend 350 rubles 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.520
 it's not money right now it's not two 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.770
 half a thousand rubles like 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.419
 battlefield hardline oh well on this 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.539
 me all join the group vk 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.110
 offer your ideas for commercials 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.029
