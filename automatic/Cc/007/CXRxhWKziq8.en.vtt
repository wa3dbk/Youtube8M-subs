Sweden so right here is the lick it
started<00:00:18.750> right<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.890> shot<00:00:20.340> kind<00:00:21.180> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
started right here and it shot kind of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.200 
started right here and it shot kind of
in<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> straight<00:00:21.750> line<00:00:21.830> making<00:00:22.830> slight<00:00:23.730> zigzags

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
in a straight line making slight zigzags

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
in a straight line making slight zigzags
and<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.720> few<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.560> almost<00:00:25.949> right<00:00:26.220> angle<00:00:26.519> turns

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and a few like almost right angle turns

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.560 
and a few like almost right angle turns
and<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.900> stopped<00:00:28.260> right<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.820> I'm

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and then it stopped right about here I'm

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
and then it stopped right about here I'm
flickered<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.790> disappeared<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> little<00:00:33.030> bit

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
flickered and disappeared a little bit

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
flickered and disappeared a little bit
and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> reappeared<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.320> did<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.649> s

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and then it reappeared and did more s

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.209 
and then it reappeared and did more s
turns<00:00:35.329> like<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:37.230> few<00:00:37.590> more<00:00:37.739> bright<00:00:37.920> angle

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
turns like that a few more bright angle

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.090 
turns like that a few more bright angle
turns<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.780> spread<00:00:40.290> real<00:00:40.559> thin<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
turns and then it spread real thin and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
turns and then it spread real thin and
there<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> shimmering<00:00:43.200> light

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
there was just a lot of shimmering light

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.830 
there was just a lot of shimmering light
and<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:44.340> disappeared<00:00:44.730> completely<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and it disappeared completely and I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
and it disappeared completely and I
still<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.670> saw

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
still don't know what it is that I saw

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
still don't know what it is that I saw
for<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> reference<00:00:49.230> point<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.800> standing

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
for a reference point I was standing

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.750 
for a reference point I was standing
right<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:51.110> on<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.410> peak<00:00:52.710> which<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.489> about

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
right here on this peak which is about

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
right here on this peak which is about
twelve<00:00:54.030> hundred<00:00:54.059> meters<00:00:54.510> high<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.199> Lake

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
twelve hundred meters high and this Lake

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950 
twelve hundred meters high and this Lake
is<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:55.649> 700<00:00:56.640> meters<00:00:56.730> high<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.390> pretty

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
is about 700 meters high so it's pretty

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.729 
is about 700 meters high so it's pretty
high<00:00:58.170> above<00:00:58.410> sea<00:00:58.440> level<00:00:59.000> and<00:01:00.170> all<00:01:01.170> around<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
high above sea level and all around this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.640 
high above sea level and all around this
lake<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.399> barren<00:01:03.059> Tundra<00:01:03.650> there's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
lake is just barren Tundra there's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890 
lake is just barren Tundra there's
nothing<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.400> there's<00:01:05.610> no<00:01:05.729> houses<00:01:05.970> no<00:01:06.210> no

nothing up here there's no houses no no
roads<00:01:07.400> I<00:01:08.900> really<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> boat

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
roads I really don't think it was a boat

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.190 
roads I really don't think it was a boat
that<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.010> saw<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:12.150> made<00:01:12.360> no<00:01:12.540> noise<00:01:12.780> there<00:01:13.140> were

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that I saw it made no noise there were

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.109 
that I saw it made no noise there were
no<00:01:13.320> ripples<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> water<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.640> watch<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
no ripples in the water so watch the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
no ripples in the water so watch the
video<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.140> yourself

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.920 

fuck<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.170 

did<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.770> just<00:01:36.950> broke<00:01:37.130> into<00:01:37.340> two<00:01:37.610> now<00:01:40.000> now<00:01:41.000> it's

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
did it just broke into two now now it's

did it just broke into two now now it's
gone

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.620 

no<00:01:46.100> no<00:01:46.370> it<00:01:46.490> started<00:01:46.730> up<00:01:46.880> again

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:02.580 

pretty<00:01:50.630> sure<00:01:50.810> ice<00:01:51.050> isn't<00:01:51.260> move<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:51.620> quickly

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.650 

now

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.240 

it's<00:02:08.660> making<00:02:09.080> like<00:02:09.260> s<00:02:09.500> turns<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.010> moving

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
it's making like s turns and it's moving

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.320 
it's making like s turns and it's moving
pretty<00:02:13.490> quick<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:16.130> then<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.459> disappears<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
pretty quick and then it disappears and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.360 
pretty quick and then it disappears and
then<00:02:17.480> reappears<00:02:20.560> something<00:02:21.560> swimming<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.100> yes

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
then reappears something swimming is yes

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:31.540 
then reappears something swimming is yes
the<00:02:22.640> answer<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.180> look<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.260> gone<00:02:30.550> no
