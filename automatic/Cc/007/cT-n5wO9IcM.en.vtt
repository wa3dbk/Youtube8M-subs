00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.899
 the most important reason for a minivan 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.610
 buy is probably the big one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.500
 Interior offer with small outside length 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.660

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 points 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.600
 while the length of four meters 10 so 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.810
 compact remained as in the first 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 generation grew the space 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.359
 clearly in the fund is the freedom from the knees 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.240
 really excellent and not 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710
 only for a small vehicle that applies 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.219
 if you go back to the very back 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.989
 She pushes her forward pointing 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.000
 the enormous trunk of his 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.340
 best side 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.290
 do you still work around the rear seats 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 really fit over 2,000 liters in that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.469
 way more than even in a vw 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 passat variant 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.600
 the second highlight of the new note is 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.039
 the optional technology package 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.430
 it includes, among other things, a four 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.109
 Cameras based surround view system 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.539
 when parking the car from the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.070
 bird's-eye view shows in 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.119
 small car segment is the one premiere 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 It also includes security assistants 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 to date not in this class 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.920
 were offered such as a blind spot 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 assistant and a lane departure warning 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.430
 remarkable in the interior are the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.430
 fuel-efficient ideas 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.680
 so there is one at the touch of a button 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.290
 Activatable eco mode is the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.380
 turned on is gentle drive with 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.479
 greenish points rewarded at 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.060
 pressed sports button remain the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.570
 Aggregate, however, as clear as we do 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.250
 had to determine on our trip 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.180
 we drove the emergency with a technical 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.270
 nerds under the hood of the emergency 1.2

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.780
 petrol engine with compressor of 13 and 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.200
 known slightly rough engine noise when 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.470
 speed like but constant 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.520
 ride sounds aggregate of dumb before 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.690
 especially if you look at the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.979
 switching recommendation keeps the acceleration 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.739
 one does not leave the stool 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.810
 but the standard consumption is record for that 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:22.760
