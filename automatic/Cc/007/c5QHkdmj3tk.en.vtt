so I got it
the<00:02:09.500> LED<00:02:09.679> strip<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.010> advertised<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.610> running

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
the LED strip is advertised is running

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.030 
the LED strip is advertised is running
off<00:02:10.940> 12<00:02:11.180> volt<00:02:11.360> but<00:02:11.660> clearly<00:02:11.989> Orcs<00:02:12.320> out<00:02:12.410> 9<00:02:12.590> I'm

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
off 12 volt but clearly Orcs out 9 I'm

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.920 
off 12 volt but clearly Orcs out 9 I'm
gonna<00:02:13.610> test<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.000> with<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.209> 12<00:02:14.420> volt<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.780> I'm

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
gonna test it with the 12 volt and I'm

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.910 
gonna test it with the 12 volt and I'm
assuming<00:02:15.140> it'll<00:02:15.470> probably<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.800> little

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
assuming it'll probably a little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.300 
assuming it'll probably a little
brighter

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
brighter

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.910 
brighter
but<00:02:16.520> what<00:02:16.850> totally<00:02:17.180> works<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:18.260> gold<00:02:18.680> demo

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
but what totally works and the gold demo

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.400 
but what totally works and the gold demo
mode<00:02:19.130> it'll<00:02:19.459> go<00:02:19.670> through<00:02:19.880> this<00:02:20.410> pattern

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
mode it'll go through this pattern

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.380 
mode it'll go through this pattern
cycling<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:21.920> stuff<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.970> remote

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
cycling and stuff like that the remote

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.380 
cycling and stuff like that the remote
