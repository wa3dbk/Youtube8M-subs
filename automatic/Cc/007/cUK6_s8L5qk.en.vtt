00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
scene so you guys can see what the base

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.510 
scene so you guys can see what the base
looks<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:52.260> were<00:00:52.379> some<00:00:52.649> errors<00:00:52.860> when<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
looks like there were some errors when I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
these blocks are over here i do want to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.639 
these blocks are over here i do want to
check<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.659> quick<00:01:44.420> what<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.750> these

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
check a little quick what is this these

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080 
check a little quick what is this these
are<00:01:46.740> iron<00:01:46.950> scaffold<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:47.970> actually

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
are iron scaffold so you can actually

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.330 
are iron scaffold so you can actually
climb<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.659> I'm<00:01:49.170> assuming<00:01:49.680> that's<00:01:49.799> actually

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
climb up I'm assuming that's actually

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.240 
climb up I'm assuming that's actually
what<00:01:50.490> he<00:01:50.579> used<00:01:50.850> maybe<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.680> some<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
what he used maybe to get to some of the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
what he used maybe to get to some of the
other<00:01:53.280> areas<00:01:53.820> maybe<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.990> how<00:01:55.259> he

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
other areas maybe that's just how he

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.550 
other areas maybe that's just how he

to<00:01:59.729> look<00:01:59.969> down<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.210> we're<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.659> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
to look down so we're going to do a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.160 
to look down so we're going to do a
quick<00:02:00.750> 360<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> base<00:02:02.990> we've<00:02:03.990> got

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
quick 360 out of the base we've got

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.820 
quick 360 out of the base we've got
exits<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.920> each<00:02:05.340> side<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.240> see

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
exits on each side as you can see

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.770 
exits on each side as you can see
so<00:02:07.130> getting<00:02:07.370> in<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.790> is<00:02:08.090> no<00:02:08.360> problem

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780

all right let's head on down to the
bottom<00:02:57.040> see<00:02:58.040> what<00:02:58.160> these<00:02:58.250> steam<00:02:58.459> engines<00:02:58.730> look

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
bottom see what these steam engines look

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.400 
bottom see what these steam engines look
like<00:03:00.220> um<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:02.980> guess<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.160> staircase<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.640> okay

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
like um I guess that staircase is okay

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.820 
like um I guess that staircase is okay
all<00:03:06.410> right<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.770> these<00:03:06.980> are<00:03:07.280> redstone<00:03:07.730> blocks

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
all right so these are redstone blocks

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.640 
all right so these are redstone blocks
this<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:10.070> engine<00:03:10.400> one<00:03:11.050> what<00:03:12.050> is<00:03:12.170> engine<00:03:12.440> one

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
this is engine one what is engine one

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.400 
this is engine one what is engine one
running<00:03:12.980> off<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.660> he's<00:03:14.660> got<00:03:14.840> fuel<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.200> there

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
running off of he's got fuel in there

Wow<00:03:52.070> is<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:52.700> ridiculous<00:03:53.690> piping<00:03:54.140> so<00:03:54.950> he's

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
Wow is this ridiculous piping so he's

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.550 
Wow is this ridiculous piping so he's
running<00:03:55.310> all<00:03:55.489> of<00:03:55.640> these<00:03:55.820> into<00:03:56.570> refineries

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
running all of these into refineries

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.580 
running all of these into refineries
which<00:03:58.250> are<00:03:58.400> then<00:03:58.580> running<00:03:59.060> off<00:03:59.420> to<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.410> steam

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
which are then running off to the steam

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.949 
which are then running off to the steam
engines<00:04:00.920> that's<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.700> lot<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.030> piping<00:04:02.600> he's<00:04:02.750> got

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
engines that's a lot of piping he's got

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.350 
engines that's a lot of piping he's got
down<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.980> cool<00:04:04.239> just<00:04:05.239> a

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
down that that is cool just a

this is the only bodies of water nearby
nope<00:04:50.199> maybe<00:04:51.190> over<00:04:51.430> here<00:04:52.229> it<00:04:53.229> does<00:04:53.409> look<00:04:53.440> like

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
nope maybe over here it does look like

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.170 
nope maybe over here it does look like
there's<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.949> platform<00:04:54.400> over<00:04:54.580> here<00:04:54.699> yep<00:04:54.909> there

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180
