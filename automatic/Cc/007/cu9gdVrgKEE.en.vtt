stairs we're going to place one here in
the<00:01:49.020> front<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.950> shape<00:01:50.280> alright<00:01:50.810> then

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the front in this shape alright then

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
the front in this shape alright then
we're<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> move<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> block<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
we're going to move on to block of

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.310 
we're going to move on to block of
quartz<00:01:53.670> quartz<00:01:54.180> we're<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> place

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
quartz quartz we're going to place

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.010 
quartz quartz we're going to place
two<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.430> middle<00:01:57.760> same<00:01:58.450> on<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.750> side

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
two here in the middle same on this side

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.720 
two here in the middle same on this side
so<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.560> should<00:01:59.710> have<00:01:59.860> two<00:02:00.130> blocks<00:02:00.340> free<00:02:00.610> on

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
so you should have two blocks free on

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.730 
so you should have two blocks free on
each<00:02:00.880> side<00:02:01.150> then<00:02:01.810> I'm<00:02:01.870> going<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.050> add<00:02:02.140> one<00:02:02.590> here

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
each side then I'm going to add one here

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.670 
each side then I'm going to add one here
in<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.920> front<00:02:03.070> one<00:02:03.760> here<00:02:04.090> one<00:02:04.810> here<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.260> one

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
in the front one here one here and one

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.870 
in the front one here one here and one

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
above the Hooper hopper

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.440 
above the Hooper hopper
BAM<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:07.810> from<00:02:08.020> above<00:02:08.290> we<00:02:08.530> get<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:08.979> going<00:02:09.450> then

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
BAM so from above we get this going then

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.090 
BAM so from above we get this going then
we're<00:02:10.780> going<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:10.960> grab<00:02:11.170> some<00:02:11.290> quartz<00:02:11.860> II

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
we're going to grab some quartz II

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.050 
we're going to grab some quartz II
stairs<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.330> place<00:02:13.810> them<00:02:14.020> upside<00:02:14.530> down<00:02:15.060> facing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
facing that way then in the on the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.720 
facing that way then in the on the
inside<00:02:35.680> we're<00:02:35.830> going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.010> add<00:02:36.160> one<00:02:38.190> stair<00:02:39.190> here

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
inside we're going to add one stair here

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.610 
inside we're going to add one stair here
which<00:02:40.240> kind<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.480> covers<00:02:40.780> up<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.140> little<00:02:41.290> hole

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.480 
which kind of covers up the little hole
here<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:43.150> upside<00:02:43.930> down<00:02:44.380> here<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.250> that's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
here and one upside down here so that's

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.210 
here and one upside down here so that's
going<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.760> give<00:02:45.940> us<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.500> little<00:02:47.500> sitting<00:02:48.010> area

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
going to give us a little sitting area

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.190 
going to give us a little sitting area
up<00:02:48.550> here<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.690> only<00:02:49.870> thing<00:02:50.080> I'm<00:02:50.170> thinking

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
up here the only thing I'm thinking

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.620 
up here the only thing I'm thinking
about<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.760> only<00:02:51.970> thing<00:02:52.150> I'm<00:02:52.270> thinking<00:02:52.600> about

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
about the only thing I'm thinking about

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.770 
about the only thing I'm thinking about
is<00:02:53.050> my<00:02:53.350> corner<00:02:54.100> right<00:02:54.220> which<00:02:54.940> side<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.600> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
is my corner right which side is it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.260 
is my corner right which side is it
gonna<00:02:56.020> all<00:02:56.290> right<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.709> need<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.890> break<00:02:57.100> that

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
gonna all right so we need to break that

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.800 
gonna all right so we need to break that
delete<00:02:58.620> replace<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.269> place<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.420> minecart

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
delete replace and place the minecart

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.710 
delete replace and place the minecart
but<00:03:02.140> before<00:03:02.590> we<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:02.880> let's<00:03:03.880> add<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.150> trippy

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
but before we do that let's add a trippy

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.420 
but before we do that let's add a trippy
wheel<00:03:04.930> all<00:03:05.140> right<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.470> we're<00:03:05.590> going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.769> use<00:03:06.130> an

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
wheel all right so we're going to use an

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.670 
wheel all right so we're going to use an
item<00:03:07.269> frame<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.140> maybe<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:09.190> do<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.640> black<00:03:09.940> disc

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
item frame and maybe to do a black disc

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.160 
item frame and maybe to do a black disc
because<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.190> how<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.489> roll<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:13.600> is<00:03:13.989> how

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
because that is how we roll this is how

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.090 
because that is how we roll this is how
we<00:03:14.470> do<00:03:14.739> it

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
we do it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.820 
we do it
BAM<00:03:15.850> minecart<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.560> might<00:03:17.709> be<00:03:17.799> thinking

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
BAM minecart and you might be thinking

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.410 
BAM minecart and you might be thinking
like<00:03:18.250> how<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.519> hell<00:03:18.700> are<00:03:18.850> we<00:03:18.940> going<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.209> enter

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
like how the hell are we going to enter

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.460 
like how the hell are we going to enter
this<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.780> know<00:03:19.900> what<00:03:20.049> don't<00:03:20.230> worry<00:03:20.380> about

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
engine here because we get a little

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.780 
engine here because we get a little
block<00:03:25.480> missing<00:03:25.959> here<00:03:26.410> I'm<00:03:26.590> just<00:03:26.950> gonna<00:03:27.100> use<00:03:27.489> I

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
block missing here I'm just gonna use I

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.699 
block missing here I'm just gonna use I
don't<00:03:27.940> know<00:03:28.209> maybe<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.510> dispenser<00:03:29.230> how's<00:03:29.410> that

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
don't know maybe a dispenser how's that

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.180 
don't know maybe a dispenser how's that
looking<00:03:30.600> kind<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.630> derp<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.500> take<00:03:33.010> that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
looking kind of derp but I take that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.009 
looking kind of derp but I take that
alright<00:03:33.580> we<00:03:33.730> could<00:03:33.910> use<00:03:34.060> maybe<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.480> furnace<00:03:34.900> as

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
alright we could use maybe a furnace as

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.930 
alright we could use maybe a furnace as
well<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.470> not<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:36.130> keep<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.459> simple
