00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
here right like how could these three

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.190 
here right like how could these three
things<00:02:47.030> be<00:02:47.209> happening<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:47.780> on<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.020> same

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
right you know so we limped on home put

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.949 
right you know so we limped on home put
it<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.290> garage<00:02:54.410> scratch<00:02:55.100> my<00:02:55.310> head<00:02:55.520> and
