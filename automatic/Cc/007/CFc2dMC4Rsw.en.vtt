00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
kit building project that's why I went

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.440 
kit building project that's why I went
out<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.440> bought<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.650> flying<00:02:33.010> glass<00:02:33.280> error<00:02:33.610> at

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
out and bought a flying glass error at

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.880 
out and bought a flying glass error at
the<00:02:34.599> time<00:02:34.780> that's<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> kind<00:02:35.379> of<00:02:35.440> flying<00:02:35.709> that

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the time that's the kind of flying that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.850 
the time that's the kind of flying that
I<00:02:35.920> thought<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.190> wanted<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.670> do<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:38.349> quite

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
I thought I wanted to do and quite

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.910 
I thought I wanted to do and quite
honestly<00:02:40.170> before<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.349> started<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.739> program

my<00:02:42.280> mechanical<00:02:42.819> ability<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.269> kind<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.629> joke

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
my mechanical ability I kind of joke

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.360 
my mechanical ability I kind of joke
around<00:02:43.989> about<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.409> it<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:44.769> sort<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.980> limited

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
around about it it was sort of limited

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.440 
around about it it was sort of limited
to<00:02:45.459> knowing<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.730> difference<00:02:46.060> between<00:02:46.090> is
