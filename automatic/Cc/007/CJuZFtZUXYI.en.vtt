00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.610
 chef and today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.620
 rice to the poblana this rose and two 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 versions to make it one is how the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 I'm going to do in this video that will be with

 slit sky I see you a white rice 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.230
 the second option instead of putting the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.449
 hatches on the tree will liquefy the chili 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 poblano together with garlic and onion 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.250
 doing the same procedure with this 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 we will have a green rice with the taste 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.899
 chile poblano a basic make a rice 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 but for those who do not know here 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.770
 is how to do it and one more idea for 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.809
 prepare some rice but always be

 a greeting to you three if you want 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.719

 recipes that they like 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.800
 and comment here in the bottom part we 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.930
 we see the next one to prepare our 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.900
 rosa las poblanas let's use two 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.450
 cups rice 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.150
 and I'm going to leave it soaking with water 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.070
 warm for 10 minutes nothing more after 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.580
 our 10 minutes let's rinse 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.190
 our rice I'm going to cut and I 'll return 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.130
 to go through clean water 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.670
 this a couple of times we do so 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.610
 until our water now cleans or in 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.140
 the water jet as you like 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.030
 So I feel like I do not waste so much water 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.640
 how will they see my water is already coming out 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.740
 that's how it's left, I'll leave 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.869
 dry me rice for about 5 minutes in the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.760
 Strainer and now we continue to 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.380
 our rice we are going to add grains 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.540
 of corn and this time not 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.670
 get it fresh tea so I'm going to 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.979
 use of can but if you 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.050
 they get fresh corn it 's better when 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.110
 boil it with a little water and salt and the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.479
 caldito that comes out either the one from the can or 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.640
 in which we go our lot we are going to 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.470
 use as a liquid to know 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.570
 our rice meanwhile we are going to 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.390
 prepare the other ingredients for 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.600
 liquefy a quarter of onion 1 clove 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.610
 garlic here we will complete 4 cups together 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.680
 with the pot grained liquid either 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.420
 with water or chicken broth while 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.150
 so much I will be preparing my garrison 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.400
 and use one or two poblano peppers 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.070
 list of two and how do I not want that I'm going to 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.140
 chop I'm going to remove all the benita and 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.600
 the seeds if you want that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.580
 pique let them and even they can 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.980
 add some green chili 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.380
 and now I'm going to cut before I'm 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.320
 cutting slanted likes them can 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.090
 cut into small squares you know 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.700
 that this is optional and that you 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.560
 decide how they are going to cook in your house 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.110
 here we have our two boys 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.820
 medium as the great having everything 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.470
 others right let's proceed to do 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.900
 developments I will put a little bit of 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.830
 oil will let warm well and 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.830
 we add our rice 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.980
 I do not know a bit about 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.810
 of foreigners in the state 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.190
 At the beginning our rice was 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.040
 start to approach the balls 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.040
 and then it will start to take off is the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.560
 point that I'm looking for our route 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.810
 it starts to take off and it starts 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.580
 to open a sound as if it were sand 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.160
 when it hits the walls of our 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.520
 cooking pot 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.210
 next to search I'm going to add what 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.210
 we have liquefied 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.580
 let's season with a teaspoon of 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.580
 Salt 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.090
 a little but very little consomme 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.530
 chicken and as a trick so we do not miss 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.090
 stick we will put a few drops of lemon 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.970
 at this point we have our man 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.450
 at high heat and we want it to start 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.010
 to boil everything 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.010
 as fast as possible 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:36.610
 already started to boil our rice let's 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.610
 to add our poblano we 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.440
 we rectify the seasoning and since it is 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.780
 boiling in spurts we will lower our 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.110
 cook on medium heat until 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.180
 start to evaporate all the liquid 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.850
 as we will see it is drying up 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.670
 our rice and we have very little left 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.220
 liquid is halfway through, still in 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.310
 this point we will add our grain 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.490
 of lotte we mix this is the last 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.950
 opportunity to rectify its seasoning and 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.190
 now we are going to cover and go down 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.550
 our fire to the minimum the least 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.130
 possible I will leave 10 minutes and 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.290
 I'll see if it has already dried our rice and 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.750
 we will not move at this point have 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.430
 past our 10 minutes we are going to 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.370
 verify develops it was the 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.160
 liquid in this case also contains a 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.490
 I 'm going to leave it for another 5 minutes 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.710
 more remember to fire extremely down what 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.890
 lowest possible they can in their name 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.800
 after 25 minutes I will let it rest and 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.760
 is more already with the fire off and will be 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.740
 ready 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.009
 and that's how our 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.949
 rice 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:54.610
 let's take off a little with a fork 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:56.800
 and say how we have our rice 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.530
 if you do not want a little more success add 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.039
 three and a half cups and anyway they 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.039
 healthy
