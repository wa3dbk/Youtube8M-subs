a<00:00:36.570> bomb<00:00:36.809> goes<00:00:36.840> off<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:38.270> this<00:00:39.270> film<00:00:39.629> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
a bomb goes off so this film it's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.619 
a bomb goes off so this film it's
exactly<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> neat<00:00:42.450> thing

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
exactly what is and the the neat thing

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.000 
exactly what is and the the neat thing
about<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.050> I'll<00:00:43.260> hold<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> window<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.890> here

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
about this I'll hold the window up here

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
about this I'll hold the window up here
so<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> shot<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.120> comes<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.629> two

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
so we can get a shot it comes in two

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.900 
so we can get a shot it comes in two
different<00:00:45.840> colors<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> tint<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.550> maybe<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
different colors of tint and maybe if I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.310 
different colors of tint and maybe if I
pull<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> white<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.660> behind<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> you'll<00:00:49.200> be

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
pull the white up behind it you'll be

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.389 
pull the white up behind it you'll be
able<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> difference

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
able to kind of see the difference

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
able to kind of see the difference
between<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.789> two<00:00:50.940> colors<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> also

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
between the two colors and it also

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
between the two colors and it also
protects<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.739> homes<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> UV<00:00:53.850> rays<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
protects your homes from the UV rays of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
protects your homes from the UV rays of
the<00:00:54.329> Sun<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.079> qualifies<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.710> an

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the Sun so it qualifies for an

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
the Sun so it qualifies for an
energy-efficient<00:00:56.850> tax<00:00:57.120> credit<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
energy-efficient tax credit from the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.619 
energy-efficient tax credit from the
government<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> 30%<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.670> $1,500<00:01:00.420> back

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
government up to 30% or $1,500 back

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
government up to 30% or $1,500 back
which<00:01:00.840> lowers<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.199> price<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.370> whole

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
which lowers the price to do your whole

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.899 
which lowers the price to do your whole
house<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.290> it's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> big<00:01:04.559> range<00:01:04.909> $2,500

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
house would be it's a big range $2,500

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.880 
house would be it's a big range $2,500
to<00:01:06.060> maybe<00:01:06.210> $9,000<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> protect<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> whole

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
to maybe $9,000 to protect the whole

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.140 
to maybe $9,000 to protect the whole
house<00:01:08.100> especially<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:08.909> you're<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
house especially if you're in a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
house especially if you're in a
hurricane<00:01:09.360> area<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.439> lot<00:01:10.650> less<00:01:10.890> than

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
hurricane area that's a lot less than

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.469 
hurricane area that's a lot less than
buying<00:01:11.250> hurricane<00:01:11.729> shutters<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.240> something

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
buying hurricane shutters or something

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.450 
buying hurricane shutters or something
like<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.500> North<00:01:13.770> Texas<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
like that in North Texas we have the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.789 
like that in North Texas we have the
added<00:01:14.820> benefit<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.869> burglar<00:01:16.259> protection

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
added benefit of the burglar protection

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
added benefit of the burglar protection
now<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.280> brought<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> couple<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.850> videos<00:01:18.150> in

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
now I've brought a couple of videos in

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that I want to show in case this doesn't

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.170 
that I want to show in case this doesn't
work<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.400> we're<00:01:20.640> gonna<00:01:20.729> ask<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> to
