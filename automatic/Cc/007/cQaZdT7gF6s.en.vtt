 The roulette consists of a large wheel, a table with numbers and of course the roulette 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.180
 ball. 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.750
 The croupier spins the wheel and then drops the ball into it. 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.159
 The number on which the ball falls is awarded a prize. 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.010
 Before the game starts, the dealer asks 'place your bets', 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.890
 in other words, place your stake! 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.730

 With a column bet you bet on a whole row of numbers, from left to right. 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.040

 So far the basic rules that you need for playing roulette. 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.950
 Many casino players believe in special techniques that would generate more profit 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.810
 while playing the roulette. 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.100
 We will discuss one of the most used techniques 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.630
 with which people think they can make more profit. 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.610
 The Martingale roulette system is the most famous roulette method of the moment. 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.260
 This technique only uses the red and black boxes. 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.900
 The method works as follows. 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.320
 You start with a deposit of 1 euro on black. 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.930
 If the roulette turns red, you lose 1 euro. 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.560
 You now have to invest 2 euros, again on black. 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.840
 You keep doubling your stake until the ball turns black and you win. 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.020
 If the ball has fallen on black, you start again with 1 euro but then on red. You stay 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.790
 double it until you win. Then switch to black again. 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.240
 This method has of course been extensively researched and calculated. 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.490
 The conclusion is that the method has virtually no chance of winning. 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.000
 In certain cases, however, the chance of winning can be increased slightly 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.530
 by using this method. 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.180
