00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
is in modern warfare 2 is you run out of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.899 
is in modern warfare 2 is you run out of
ammo<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.299> fast<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> wasn't<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.759> know<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
ammo really fast so I wasn't you know I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
ammo really fast so I wasn't you know I
was<00:01:42.150> thinking<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> f2000<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> red

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
was thinking like the f2000 with the red

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.460 
was thinking like the f2000 with the red
dot<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.490> probably<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:47.579> hardest<00:01:47.899> weapon<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
dot is probably the hardest weapon to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
dot is probably the hardest weapon to
control<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> kill<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
control and get a kill with there's so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.600 
control and get a kill with there's so
many<00:01:52.079> disadvantages<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> weapon<00:01:53.280> i

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
many disadvantages with that weapon i

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.420 
many disadvantages with that weapon i
mean<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.329> kick<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.680> high<00:01:55.950> it's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
mean the the kick and it is so high it's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.789 
mean the the kick and it is so high it's
like<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:56.880> gonna<00:01:56.969> wrap<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.680> like

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
