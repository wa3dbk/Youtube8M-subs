two<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.279> them<00:00:21.369> right<00:00:21.520> there<00:00:22.320> they<00:00:23.320> I<00:00:24.570> guess

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
two of them right there they I guess

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.179 
two of them right there they I guess
that's<00:00:25.779> not<00:00:25.990> the<00:00:26.050> main<00:00:26.289> one<00:00:26.320> anymore<00:00:26.769> now<00:00:27.039> it's

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
that's not the main one anymore now it's

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.790 
that's not the main one anymore now it's
this<00:00:27.339> loop<00:00:27.849> icon<00:00:28.359> which<00:00:28.599> is<00:00:28.750> new<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.410> improved

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
this loop icon which is new and improved

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.650 
this loop icon which is new and improved
so<00:00:30.519> you've<00:00:30.640> got<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:32.230> looks<00:00:32.500> like<00:00:32.650> a<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:37.300> lord

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
so you've got it looks like a good lord

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.350 
so you've got it looks like a good lord
that<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:37.900> cheap<00:00:38.290> um<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:40.629> not<00:00:40.809> that<00:00:41.110> good<00:00:42.360> so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
that is cheap um that's not that good so

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.810 
that is cheap um that's not that good so
this<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.870> gear<00:00:44.020> but<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.160> this<00:00:48.520> is<00:00:48.640> very

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
this is the gear but so this is very

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.779 
this is the gear but so this is very
small<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:50.590> small<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.879> headset<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:53.109> mean<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
small very small a headset I mean this

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.299 
small very small a headset I mean this
is<00:00:54.850> probably<00:00:55.480> takes<00:00:56.199> up<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.410> fraction<00:00:57.039> of<00:00:57.070> the

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
is probably takes up a fraction of the

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.569 
is probably takes up a fraction of the
room<00:00:58.829> compared<00:00:59.829> to<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.550> Prime<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:03.489> the

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
room compared to the Prime I think the

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.070 
room compared to the Prime I think the
prime<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:03.879> actually<00:01:04.149> a<00:01:04.179> better<00:01:04.360> headset<00:01:04.899> I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
prime is actually a better headset I

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.650 
prime is actually a better headset I
think<00:01:05.320> has<00:01:05.440> more<00:01:05.470> features<00:01:05.890> but<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.450> nice

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
think has more features but this is nice

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.669 
think has more features but this is nice
and<00:01:07.869> small<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:08.320> I'm<00:01:08.470> all<00:01:08.649> excited<00:01:08.830> about<00:01:09.280> it

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:20.719 

and<00:01:14.679> you<00:01:15.280> can<00:01:15.450> change<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.630> face<00:01:16.810> plate<00:01:19.319> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and you can change the face plate so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.160 
and you can change the face plate so
inside<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:21.899> we<00:01:22.899> have<00:01:24.750> looks<00:01:25.750> like<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:25.959> user

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170
