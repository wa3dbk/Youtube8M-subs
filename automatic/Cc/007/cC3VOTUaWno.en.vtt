00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.600
 such an electric drill 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.570
 drill screwdriver 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 let's consider what it is for 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.150
 intended and what is included 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:44.920
 such a drill screwdriver kit is included 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:52.470
 Brush that is more than a bit here no no 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.470
 there are brushes and suddenly here such here 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:04.840
 green us network device 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:18.140
 mains voltage 220 frequency 59 power 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:20.750
 800 10 watt drilling diameter under 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:27.640
 drilling diameter up to ten millimeters 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.220
 and turns from 0 to 750 minute 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.590
 wire length is about two 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.470
 meters 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.000
 soft silicone wire is very 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.910
 important as when 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 frost works wire wires usually 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.700
 these are just cracking and everything is on it 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.399
 ends with reverse here 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.300
 right-left button is very simple 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.720
 normal not to break and and fixation 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.000
 on the button here there is that is possible 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.830
 lock the button is intended to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.229
 screw tightening reverse 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.300
 there is a local lighting 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.209
 that is, the diode is nothing normal 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.900
 more or less highlights the adjustment 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:26.330
 gear clamping 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 force 19 and plus drilling more or less 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.129
 some kind of power 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:35.410
 gearbox installed a very convenient cartridge 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.410
 for changing bits and drills 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.890
 brushes are replaced without disassembling 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.650
 body replacement brushes 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 outer rubber handle very simple 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.620
 here 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:01.079
 comfortable but so that's pretty 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:05.599
 apparatus so let's see yes 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.599
 indeed we are highlighting 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.680
 illuminates the work surface gimpu 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:25.470
 work speed adjustment is made 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:34.010
 pressing the bits in the kit screwdriver 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:37.920
 with her here we can see let's say 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:47.280
 what bits do we need this holder for 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:52.230
 bit and magnetic convenient and here you can 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.040
 insert any bit this is one of 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.049
 holders 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.220
 there are different varieties of them 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:06.750
 mechanical magnetic that's mine 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:17.010
 a handy bit can be just pure without 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:19.380
 holder she is also magnetic and is 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.479
 I admit such insults I use it 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.030
 for fixing drywall 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.220
 that is, in order to screw I do not

 failed the cast 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.199
 I use such a magnet emphasis on 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.199
 bat dressed
