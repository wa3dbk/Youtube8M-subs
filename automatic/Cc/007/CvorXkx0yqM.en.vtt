00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 ah ah 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello everyone welcome to mac favor 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.389
 today we will perform a test 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.209
 of speed which opposes the aipac 4 to the ipad 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.930
 mini machines that are a priori enough 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.520
 different on the material level the ipad 4 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.770
 embedding a 6x processor clocked at 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.840
 1.4 GHz a dual core processor 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.149
 very powerful associated with a power chip 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.559
 vr quad-core sgx 554 ipad side mini 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.440
 is rather at the level of a hardware that 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.960
 approaching the ipad 2 a5 processor 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.239
 double heart at 1 gigahertz and 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.719
 presumably a power v power chip 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:48.250
 vr sorry sgx543 dual-core so for 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.489
 start this series of tests you have 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.749
 saw a small cast doubt that shows that 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.170
 ipad 4 goes faster 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.760
 test that is confirmed with a 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.199
 game launch in this case wise 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.719
 blood of gameloft 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:06.780
 when I heavy enough is charging more 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.780
 quickly on the iPad captain beany 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.340
 we will now try to test a 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.340
 little graphics performance 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.340
 the ipad 4 is already at stake the family but 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.860
 a few more seconds 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.530
 so obviously always a little 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.090
 complicated to come to realize 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.270
 of different on games that are very 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.780
 fluids in both cases we observe 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.780
 not really 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.680
 another launch test this time 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.620
 with the wild thing to always a little 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.730
 advantage to the ipad 4 benefit that is 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.730
 not really determining 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.210
 that's four seconds indifference a 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.130
 differential that really is not very 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.330
 noticeable we will look a little bit about it 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.420
 gives on the side of the surf with always the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.170
 limitations of this type of exercise this is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.850
 there but really what machine takes the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.770
 on top of each other for the wi connection 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.960
 fi in ideal it would take to test that 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.360
 with wifi connection traced by and is 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.210
 still barred 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.960
 I will go to particular bias of 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.960
 advertising research 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:18.680
 the ipad mini finished very lightly 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:21.459
 before ipad 4 obviously a small 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.459
 advertising management issue 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.640
 because loaded with a big slide show 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.610
 she also admitted a little faster than 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:01.760
 the ipad 4 nothing really noticeable it's 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:03.290
 very light also the opposite one can 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.580
 really say that on this surf part 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.349
 on mac forever it's a draw 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.349
 absolute arms on a news site 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.790
 maybe a little faster 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.160
 colette panini costs are second 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.759
 here we light up a draw on 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.590
 this surfing part will now make a 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.659
 little bit of calculation with ayew life then 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.099
 we shortened you a bit 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.129
 calculation of the project so that the video is 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:02.050
 a little shorter 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:03.819
 there is no bad project 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.110
 a project of 3 minutes and 24 seconds 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.259
 absolutely identical on both 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.259
 machinery 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.409
 you see that the ipad 4 took a small 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.409
 advantage 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.600
 so obviously this test really shows 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.680
 the difference between the two cpu is on 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.330
 the paper as we told you there is 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.540
 no photo 14 are becoming 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:40.340
 the occurrence to calculate this project on 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:43.010
 the ipad mini or to finish now 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.140
 with two Belgian benchmarking software 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:50.630
 performance test that measures the 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.970
 performance cpu memory write on the 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.210
 disc and readings on the disc 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.290
 graphics graphics 2d 3d is accelerated 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.830
 a little things for five times less 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.620
 long 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.860
 you see that the ipad mini has taken 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.530
 the advanced and when we look at 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.300
 results in detail are you going 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.290
 realize that the ipad mini with its 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.540
 screen that is not a screen retina is going 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.960
 faster on operations from as soon as 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.430
 the ipad 4 is at 4 him who obviously but 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.169
 my screen with four times more 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.090
 pixels so one even if he has a chip 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.720
 much more powerful graphics 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.570
 in the end we will have an ipad mini kit on 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.150
 some elements 2d for example on the 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.860
 very busy pages scroll on the web 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.100
 can be a little faster 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.660
 ipad 4 knowing that obviously she 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.490
 no blunder the fastest ipad 3 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.380
 those of you who know the 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.910
 surf on ipad 3 know that the 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.169
 slowdowns are almost 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.169
 nonexistent on this machine 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.550
 then we will look in detail at 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.340
 performances you see that with 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.840
 the assignment of general parameters 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:03.030
 ipad 4 is given as slower than 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:08.340
 the ipad mini it is 2.4 times faster 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:10.830
 1 in cpu about 1 5 times on the 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.580
 writes the disk and memory and it is 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.660
 twice as long in terms of 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:22.080
 dn1 3d trap display of 20% plus 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.490
 slow than the ipad mini at the Belgian body 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.090
 who measures him the performances 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.800
 processors and memory performance 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.000
 will show you 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:35.400
 conversely the performance very strong 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.930
 given 4 4 what can we say is that 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.970
 these two machines are very very 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.680
 balanced and offer an experience 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.750
 overall very close 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.250
 here we hope that this little test has us 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.080
 interested and we'll see you soon 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.080
 on mac forever of course ciao
