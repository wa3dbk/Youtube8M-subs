00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.470
 hi friends today let's make a source 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.209
 of clear homemade water relaxing and it is very 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.340
 easy to do everything is to know inside 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.230
 a moment and we will come very well 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.160
 for those moments that we need 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.919
 concentration and relaxation so let's 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.990
 see how materials are made 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.960
 we're going to need is a cds 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.419
 or empty dvds a scissors a gun 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.679
 hot silicone a stack of 4.5 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:32.020
 volts a stick a straw a straw 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.630
 Splice of these splice an engine 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.840
 electric a trainer and a saw 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.660
 well let's go to the mess the first thing is the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.670
 you have to cut this 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.830
 good that we will worthlessness 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.620
 that a saw cuts well so what 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.740
 we eliminate then we need to get out of the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.260
 good splice strip is cut and with 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.360
 scissors is removed the insulation 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.340
 zone is plastic and this will remain 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 this is what we need to splice 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 what is the motor shaft 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.880
 you have to take a line according to the axis 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:11.380
 Of course it has to be fair enough 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:15.430
 with the stick that we are going to use for 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.380
 which is to hook the straw or the straw 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.929
 well you have to divide it into three parts 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.170
 we'll cut like this at an angle 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.750
 we bend and cut again at an angle 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.310
 and we doubled this that does this makes 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.600
 then you will have the water outlet out there 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.430
 and well let's make a hole here and 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.770
 on the other side another hole with the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.149
 hot silicone gun that is 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.119
 hot and clear then I challenge you the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.640
 practical very well and this will be for 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.140
 introduce the stick but before we go to 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.759
 fix the motor to the lid of the pan 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.780
 a little hot silicone and up 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.360
 well what I said let's put in the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.880
 stick through the holes we've made 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.970
 with the gun we put it we fix it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.950
 need a little more up like 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.100
 centimeter like that higher because no 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.840
 has to touch the bottom and well what 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.269
 we stick with hot silicone with a lot 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 careful not to burn the plastic and what 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.080
 we present we see that it is good 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.820
 what good height if you had to do 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.180
 some clipping is done cut well rotates 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.020
 it's stable so well let's do 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.480
 the electrical installation 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.630
 what said 4.5 volts but because the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.570
 engine runs at that voltage every engine 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.220
 the voltage that requires fix a bit 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.310
 hot silicone and we would have 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.110
 done everything nothing already prepared let's go 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.650
 to do a motor test to see if 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.390
 will demand and even say that this is for the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.460
 centrifugal force by which water 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.410
 it leaves goodbye picks up the water from below 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.540
 and by centrifugal force because the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.850
 dismiss, let's fill in, well, I'm going to 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.310
 fill up a little less than the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.440
 half and put coloring to do it 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.590
 more colorful each one as you want what 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.630
 what color does he want and nothing 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.660
 Well, we're going to try the post if you see 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.960
 there is a straw that splashed 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.130
 too much so good so a 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.260
 modification of fact me but it is not 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.620
 necessary the fact because dear and 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.599
 let's start working 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.750
 very very nice and the truth is that 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.240
 colorful and relaxing 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.790
 Well, you have seen how the 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.120
 Relaxing water source is very very 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.320
 easy and you can put the color that 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.330
 you want 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.790
 in this case we have seen good 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.950
 formerly red is now in 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.260
 yellow and just doing with 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.630
 food coloring a series of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.250
 changes we can vary the color 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.000
 from our relaxing source l 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:56.770
 it will go from a yellow 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.660
 to a blue so here I leave you with some 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.870
 images of 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.460
 the relaxing source I hope that I have 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.300
 liked a greeting 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.300
