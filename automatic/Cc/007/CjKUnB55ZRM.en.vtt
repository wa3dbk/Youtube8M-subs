00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
even hitting me so no matter what I do

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.910 
even hitting me so no matter what I do
even<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.719> mean<00:00:39.989> occasionally<00:00:40.290> they'll<00:00:40.620> hit<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
even I mean occasionally they'll hit you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.889 
even I mean occasionally they'll hit you
but<00:00:41.070> really<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.149> guns<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.660> just

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
but really if you have guns you just

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.810 
but really if you have guns you just
keep<00:00:43.079> shooting<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.640> kill

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
keep shooting at them and you can kill

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
keep shooting at them and you can kill
them<00:00:44.940> before<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.270> kill<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.950> once

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
them before they kill you and then once

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
them before they kill you and then once
you<00:00:47.399> wipe<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.899> pretty

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
you wipe them all out you can pretty

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.889 
you wipe them all out you can pretty
much<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.530> pick<00:00:49.800> him<00:00:49.920> back<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:51.059> before<00:00:51.780> he

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
much just pick him back up so before he

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.479 
much just pick him back up so before he
dies<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> times<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.250> hide

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
dies as you see the times really hide

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
dies as you see the times really hide
now<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> time<00:00:54.180> gets<00:00:54.600> smaller<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
now but the time gets smaller and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.099 
now but the time gets smaller and
smaller<00:00:55.110> each<00:00:55.649> um<00:00:56.489> that's<00:00:57.149> around<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
smaller each um that's around as the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.170 
smaller each um that's around as the
rounds<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.730> wipe<00:00:59.879> them<00:01:00.000> all

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
rounds go on but you just wipe them all

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.580 
rounds go on but you just wipe them all
out<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> end<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> wave<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
out and then at the end of the wave you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.110 
out and then at the end of the wave you
can<00:01:01.649> pick<00:01:01.859> them<00:01:01.949> back<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.370> whatever<00:01:02.579> go

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
can pick them back up or whatever go

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.090 
can pick them back up or whatever go
replenish<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.780> ammo<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.439> um

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
replenish your ammo by um

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.719 
replenish your ammo by um
predator<00:01:05.760> missiles<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.210> stuff<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.549> as<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
predator missiles and stuff and as you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.660 
predator missiles and stuff and as you
see<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.970> got<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.330> far<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.320> um<00:01:10.670> we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
see we got pretty far it's not um we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.160 
see we got pretty far it's not um we
ended<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.000> dying<00:01:12.360> at<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.810> wave

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
ended up dying at like wave

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.950 
ended up dying at like wave
twenty-something<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> mean<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
twenty-something but I mean if you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
twenty-something but I mean if you
perfect<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.619> strategy<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:17.520> you'll<00:01:17.759> do

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
perfect this strategy then you'll do

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.490 
perfect this strategy then you'll do
pretty<00:01:18.150> good<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.380> high

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pretty good or you can get high

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.289 
pretty good or you can get high
leaderboards<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.189> whatnot<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.820> pretty<00:01:21.180> easy

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
leaderboards and whatnot so pretty easy

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.130 
leaderboards and whatnot so pretty easy
glitch<00:01:22.130> as<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.390> once<00:01:24.600> again<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
glitch as you can see once again all you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
glitch as you can see once again all you
do<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> guys<00:01:26.009> standing<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
do is have the guys standing on the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.719 
do is have the guys standing on the
stairwell<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.470> whatever<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.520> he<00:01:29.610> goes

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
stairwell or whatever and if he goes

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
stairwell or whatever and if he goes
down<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> barrier<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
down there it's like a barrier and the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
down there it's like a barrier and the
people<00:01:31.500> can't<00:01:31.710> hit<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.790> um<00:01:33.030> use<00:01:33.900> this

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
people can't hit you so um use this

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.069 
people can't hit you so um use this
strategy<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.180> be<00:01:36.180> sure<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> thumbs<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
strategy and be sure to thumbs up the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.800 
strategy and be sure to thumbs up the
video<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:38.090> I'm<00:01:39.090> gonna<00:01:39.210> show<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.780> more

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
video and I'm gonna show you one more

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.520 
video and I'm gonna show you one more
time<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.770> where<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.930> happens<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
time on where or what happens when the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.139 
time on where or what happens when the
people<00:01:43.619> try<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.890> shoot<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.340> you

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.969 

so<00:01:52.149> as<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.479> can<00:01:52.600> see<00:01:52.750> here<00:01:52.990> he<00:01:53.170> goes<00:01:53.380> down<00:01:53.619> and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
so as you can see here he goes down and

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.370 
so as you can see here he goes down and
these<00:01:54.880> people<00:01:55.119> are<00:01:55.479> trying<00:01:55.689> their<00:01:55.930> hardest<00:01:56.079> to

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
these people are trying their hardest to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.990 
these people are trying their hardest to
