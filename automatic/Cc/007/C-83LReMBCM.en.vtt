00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
do two different types of cookie dough

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.930 
do two different types of cookie dough
pops<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.890> first<00:03:26.070> one<00:03:26.370> we're<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.640> going<00:03:26.880> to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
pops the first one we're just going to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.910 
pops the first one we're just going to
dip<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.330> about<00:03:27.570> halfway<00:03:27.840> or<00:03:28.410> maybe<00:03:28.590> even<00:03:28.710> a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
dip in about halfway or maybe even a

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.350 
dip in about halfway or maybe even a
little<00:03:28.950> less<00:03:29.190> than<00:03:29.550> halfway<00:03:29.760> because<00:03:30.240> you

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
little less than halfway because you

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.420 
little less than halfway because you
don't<00:03:30.570> want<00:03:30.840> too<00:03:31.410> much<00:03:31.590> chocolate<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:32.190> there

don't want too much chocolate on there

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.310 
don't want too much chocolate on there
because<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> semi-sweet<00:03:33.600> can<00:03:33.930> be<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.080> little

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
because the semi-sweet can be a little

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.610 
because the semi-sweet can be a little
overpowering<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.640> might<00:03:36.210> want<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.450> make

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
overpowering so you might want to make

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.470 
overpowering so you might want to make
these<00:03:37.620> kind<00:03:38.070> along<00:03:38.580> with<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.060> completely
