00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.000
 Truck Mechanic 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 - Sylvain [workshop supervisor]: I started as a mechanic at a very small age and then there you are! 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 - Sylvain: I started at age 16 as a mechanic assistant after school and as I learned the job. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Mechanic, troubleshooter and all that follows. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 - Sylvain: Now I'm a workshop manager 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 and I work in the transport department, the central park and all the rest! 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 [voiceover: His domain to Sylvain is the industrial vehicle. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Huge machines, imposing mechanical units assisted by electronic systems. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 State-of-the-art technology for suspension, braking, tires, mechanics. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 What are you doing here Sylvain?] 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 - Sylvain: On the truck, we are putting the electronic box to diagnose the problem of starting. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Apparently there is a cylinder that was not working and we wanted to know where it came from. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 [voiceover: The diagnosis made! In addition to the tasks of routine maintenance, revisions, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Sylvain checks, measures, regulates, repairs and replaces defective parts.] 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 - Sylvain: Despite being a heavyweight, it remains a painstaking job. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 We must be careful especially when we tackle braking repairs, pads, steering, 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 It's like even important things. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 - Sylvain: We do not have the right to make mistakes! That's for sure ! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 - Sylvain: I'm very careful! I do it twice before finishing the truck 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 but in principle, it never happened to me. I touch wood but that's what! 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I'm happy when I managed to repair the vehicle 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 or troubleshoot the client and leave him satisfied and quickly. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Yes Yes ! I like it and I love it! 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 - Sylvain: Already a child I loved mechanics and I was doing mechanics. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I loved trucks, I always loved driving them ... 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 It's big, it's massive. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 The car is good but the truck is prettier for me. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 [voiceover: Thanks Sylvain who has a job that recruits. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 Demand for heavy duty mechanics is strong.]
