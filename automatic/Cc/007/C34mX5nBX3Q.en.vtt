00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
comics were pretty directly very member

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.490 
comics were pretty directly very member
when<00:00:54.609> I<00:00:54.670> first<00:00:55.059> arrived<00:00:55.390> here<00:00:55.480> people<00:00:56.260> just

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
when I first arrived here people just

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.099 
when I first arrived here people just
come<00:00:56.679> out<00:00:56.800> say<00:00:57.100> anything<00:00:57.879> then<00:00:58.690> we<00:00:58.780> must<00:00:58.899> be

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
come out say anything then we must be

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.880 
come out say anything then we must be
crazy<00:00:59.640> to<00:01:00.640> go<00:01:00.670> let<00:01:00.969> them<00:01:01.089> tell<00:01:01.300> them<00:01:01.890> hawking

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
crazy to go let them tell them hawking

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.650 
crazy to go let them tell them hawking
and<00:01:03.010> then<00:01:03.219> it<00:01:03.339> won't<00:01:03.519> be<00:01:03.609> really<00:01:04.059> five<00:01:04.269> star

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
and then it won't be really five star

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.740 
and then it won't be really five star
and<00:01:05.620> i<00:01:05.710> think<00:01:05.890> from<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.130> we<00:01:06.430> we<00:01:06.850> realize<00:01:07.300> that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
and i think from that we we realize that

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.780 
and i think from that we we realize that
there<00:01:08.530> are<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.740> minds<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.220> people<00:01:09.280> in<00:01:09.670> Hong

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
there are the minds of people in Hong

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.980 
there are the minds of people in Hong
Kong<00:01:10.470> allocation<00:01:11.470> wasn't<00:01:11.980> she<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.870> so<00:01:13.870> we

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
Kong allocation wasn't she and so we

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.650 
Kong allocation wasn't she and so we
proceed<00:01:14.380> about<00:01:14.910> chemical<00:01:15.910> strategies<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.540> how

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
proceed about chemical strategies to how

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.210 
proceed about chemical strategies to how
we're<00:01:16.840> going<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.020> deal<00:01:17.230> with<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:18.010> really

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
we're going to deal with it the really

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.030 
we're going to deal with it the really
the<00:01:18.250> really<00:01:19.150> it's<00:01:19.450> centered<00:01:19.930> around<00:01:20.040> creating

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
the really it's centered around creating

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.060 
the really it's centered around creating
a<00:01:21.130> vision<00:01:21.340> for<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.700> hotel<00:01:22.260> that<00:01:23.260> was<00:01:23.440> very

tell us to change the base of my
and<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:44.110> believe<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.440> if<00:01:44.680> we<00:01:44.710> change<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.340> way

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
and we believe that if we change the way

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.880 
and we believe that if we change the way
people<00:01:45.490> perceive<00:01:45.850> more<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:47.560> the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
well as a result there so we focused

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.530 
well as a result there so we focused
very<00:01:53.290> much<00:01:53.410> of<00:01:53.650> repositioning<00:01:54.100> my<00:01:54.760> I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
very much of repositioning my I

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.170 
very much of repositioning my I
think<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.230> can't<00:01:56.470> build<00:01:56.800> you<00:01:57.550> know<00:01:57.610> 13

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
think you can't build you know 13

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.320 
think you can't build you know 13
million<00:01:58.480> dollar<00:01:59.440> complex<00:02:00.160> like<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
million dollar complex like this the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.210 
million dollar complex like this the
billion-dollar<00:02:01.840> complex<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.830> downtown

without<00:02:03.610> changing<00:02:04.150> to<00:02:04.300> serve<00:02:04.780> me<00:02:04.870> physically

without changing to serve me physically

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.830 
without changing to serve me physically
it's<00:02:05.680> changed<00:02:06.160> significantly<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.660> think

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it's changed significantly but I think

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.690 
it's changed significantly but I think
what's<00:02:07.990> happened<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.470> there<00:02:08.710> because<00:02:09.010> we<00:02:09.550> have

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
what's happened is there because we have

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.030 
what's happened is there because we have
focused<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.300> quality<00:02:10.510> we<00:02:11.260> have<00:02:11.440> focused<00:02:11.740> on

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
focused on quality we have focused on

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.860 
focused on quality we have focused on
technology<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:13.180> what<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:13.420> refer<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.750> as
