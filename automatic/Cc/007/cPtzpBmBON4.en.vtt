00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
case I've turned it to peaceful and then

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.249 
case I've turned it to peaceful and then
I've<00:01:34.000> turned<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:34.390> back<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:35.909> normal<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:38.020> we

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
I've turned it back to normal then we

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.050 
I've turned it back to normal then we
have<00:01:38.500> mob<00:01:38.860> griefing<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.640> off<00:01:39.729> there's

have mob griefing on and off there's

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.690 
have mob griefing on and off there's
this<00:01:40.299> basically<00:01:40.630> just<00:01:40.869> says<00:01:41.110> if<00:01:42.009> mobs

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
this basically just says if mobs

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.270 
this basically just says if mobs
actually<00:01:43.060> do<00:01:43.180> damage<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.110> if<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:44.950> creeper

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
actually do damage so if the creeper

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.740 
actually do damage so if the creeper
explodes<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.820> allows<00:01:45.969> you<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.210> do<00:01:46.360> physical

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
explodes it allows you to do physical

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.319 
explodes it allows you to do physical
damage<00:01:47.079> to<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.380> environment<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.820> I'm<00:01:49.060> i

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
damage to the environment if I'm i

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.179 
damage to the environment if I'm i
normally<00:01:49.810> run<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.049> was<00:01:50.170> turned<00:01:50.439> off<00:01:50.619> so<00:01:51.070> it

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
normally run it was turned off so it

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.770 
normally run it was turned off so it
doesn't<00:01:51.219> actually<00:01:51.549> damage<00:01:51.939> so<00:01:52.450> there<00:01:52.630> we<00:01:52.750> go

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
doesn't actually damage so there we go

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.350 
doesn't actually damage so there we go
it's<00:01:53.140> not<00:01:53.320> creeper<00:01:53.860> damage<00:01:54.159> turned<00:01:54.430> off<00:01:54.549> I<00:01:54.790> can

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
it's not creeper damage turned off I can

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.850 
it's not creeper damage turned off I can
change<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.719> weather<00:01:55.840> so<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.380> make<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.619> rain

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
there's nobody there so nothing's going

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.510 
there's nobody there so nothing's going
to<00:02:36.100> happen<00:02:36.720> next<00:02:37.720> i<00:02:37.930> have<00:02:37.960> fire<00:02:38.560> used<00:02:39.040> toggle

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
to happen next i have fire used toggle

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.430 
to happen next i have fire used toggle
so<00:02:39.640> i<00:02:39.700> would<00:02:39.880> turn<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.120> on<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.300> off<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:41.200> means

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
so i would turn this on and off it means

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.230 
so i would turn this on and off it means
it's<00:02:42.040> whether<00:02:42.400> or<00:02:42.580> not<00:02:42.670> somebody<00:02:43.090> can

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240

yeah this is my control room so

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.750 
yeah this is my control room so
everything<00:04:38.200> is<00:04:38.290> really<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:39.280> click<00:04:39.490> on<00:04:39.640> any

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
everything is really but click on any

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.260 
everything is really but click on any
one<00:04:39.850> of<00:04:39.940> these

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
one of these

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.960 
one of these
it<00:04:40.750> actually<00:04:42.210> flags-off<00:04:43.210> ape<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:44.730> piston<00:04:45.730> some

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
it actually flags-off ape a piston some

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.420 
it actually flags-off ape a piston some
way<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.780> it's<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.900> bit<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.200> bit<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.950> mess<00:04:48.250> of

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
way so it's a bit of a bit of a mess of

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.280 
way so it's a bit of a bit of a mess of
redstone<00:04:48.790> at<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.120> bottom<00:04:49.420> here<00:04:49.600> but<00:04:50.050> all<00:04:50.170> of

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
redstone at the bottom here but all of

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.930 
redstone at the bottom here but all of
this<00:04:50.380> basically<00:04:50.800> sends<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.250> signal<00:04:51.400> from<00:04:51.790> the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
this basically sends a signal from the

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.020 
this basically sends a signal from the
bottom<00:04:52.630> up<00:04:53.140> through<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.830> central<00:04:54.340> central

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
bottom up through the central central

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.590 
bottom up through the central central
column<00:04:55.360> as<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.960> can<00:04:56.080> see<00:04:56.610> all<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.670> way<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.330> the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
column as you can see all the way to the

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.640 
column as you can see all the way to the
top<00:04:59.640> over<00:05:00.640> here<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.930> then<00:05:02.020> flags<00:05:02.440> off

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
top over here and then flags off

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.450 
top over here and then flags off
whatever<00:05:03.450> whatever<00:05:04.710> come<00:05:05.710> on<00:05:05.860> block<00:05:06.100> it<00:05:06.340> is

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
whatever whatever come on block it is

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.540 
whatever whatever come on block it is
set<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.880> flag<00:05:07.120> off<00:05:07.270> with<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.750> there<00:05:08.740> is<00:05:08.770> 12

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
set to flag off with and there is 12

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.660 
set to flag off with and there is 12
commands<00:05:10.360> allowed<00:05:10.900> i<00:05:10.930> think<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.670> i'll
