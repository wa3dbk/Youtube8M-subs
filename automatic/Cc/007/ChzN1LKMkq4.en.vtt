go<00:02:28.720> through<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.140> bikes<00:02:29.350> completely<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.430> we

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
go through the bikes completely and we

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.339 
go through the bikes completely and we
do<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.850> tuning<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.600> aligning<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
do the tuning and the aligning and the

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.289 
do the tuning and the aligning and the
quiet<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.890> build<00:02:33.220> process<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.849> would<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
quiet to build process that would do to

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.990 
quiet to build process that would do to
all<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> commercial<00:02:35.200> bikes<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.700> spinner

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
all the commercial bikes so the spinner

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.589 
all the commercial bikes so the spinner
fits<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.569> sell<00:02:37.840> are<00:02:38.110> definitely<00:02:38.560> optimal

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
fits that we sell are definitely optimal

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.570 
fits that we sell are definitely optimal
one<00:02:40.599> other<00:02:40.720> point<00:02:41.140> about<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.739> spinner<00:02:42.069> fit<00:02:42.370> is

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
one other point about the spinner fit is

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.160 
one other point about the spinner fit is
that<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.880> bottom<00:02:43.209> bracket<00:02:43.540> assembly<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:44.019> this

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
that the bottom bracket assembly in this

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.979 
that the bottom bracket assembly in this
bike<00:02:44.380> has<00:02:44.739> been<00:02:45.120> vastly<00:02:46.120> upgraded<00:02:46.720> over<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
bike has been vastly upgraded over the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.530 
bike has been vastly upgraded over the
last<00:02:47.200> two<00:02:47.470> generations<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.970> now<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.150> spinner

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
last two generations so now the spinner

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.479 
last two generations so now the spinner
fit<00:02:49.810> does<00:02:50.019> use<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> cartridge<00:02:50.709> bottom<00:02:51.160> bracket

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
fit does use a cartridge bottom bracket

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.340 
fit does use a cartridge bottom bracket
it<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> square<00:02:52.180> tapered<00:02:52.630> spindle<00:02:52.870> bottom

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
it is a square tapered spindle bottom

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.099 
it is a square tapered spindle bottom
bracket<00:02:53.680> which<00:02:54.040> means<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.450> crank<00:02:55.780> bolts

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
bracket which means that the crank bolts

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.900 
bracket which means that the crank bolts
that<00:02:56.260> hold<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.590> crank<00:02:56.950> arms<00:02:57.220> on<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
that hold the crank arms on to the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.400 
that hold the crank arms on to the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
spindle of the bottom bracket give need

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.759 
spindle of the bottom bracket give need
to<00:02:59.500> be<00:02:59.590> checked<00:02:59.890> regularly<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.739> a

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
to be checked regularly but it is a

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.580

cartridge<00:03:03.480> tight<00:03:04.480> bottom<00:03:04.720> bracket<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.410> it's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
cartridge tight bottom bracket and it's

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.319 
cartridge tight bottom bracket and it's
bicycle<00:03:06.549> quality<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.760> spinner<00:03:10.060> fit

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
bicycle quality so the spinner fit

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.229 
bicycle quality so the spinner fit
weighs<00:03:10.569> about<00:03:10.750> 80<00:03:11.079> pounds<00:03:12.060> commercial<00:03:13.060> bikes

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
