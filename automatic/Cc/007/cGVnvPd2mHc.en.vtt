00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
hardened steel for the rollers so it's a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.580 
hardened steel for the rollers so it's a
very<00:00:28.369> long<00:00:28.520> lasting<00:00:28.939> mill<00:00:29.149> we<00:00:29.750> also<00:00:29.930> have<00:00:30.230> a

end and there's also bronze shaft on
this<00:00:38.570> end<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.340> what<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.489> does<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.090> keeps

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
this end and what that does is it keeps

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.990 
this end and what that does is it keeps
the<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.989> shaft<00:00:42.200> from<00:00:42.379> wearing<00:00:42.590> out<00:00:43.000> what's

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
the the shaft from wearing out what's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.180 
the the shaft from wearing out what's
also<00:00:44.270> kind<00:00:44.450> of<00:00:44.480> neat<00:00:44.630> about<00:00:44.660> it<00:00:44.900> is<00:00:45.020> it's<00:00:45.950> a

it's got a great adjustment on it it's
very<00:00:48.950> easy<00:00:49.130> to<00:00:49.280> use<00:00:49.460> basically<00:00:50.120> what<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:50.360> do

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
very easy to use basically what you do

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.990 
very easy to use basically what you do
is<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:50.630> adjust<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.170> loosen<00:00:51.530> both<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.860> these

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
is you adjust you loosen both of these

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.280 
is you adjust you loosen both of these
adjustments<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.420> can<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:53.840> can<00:00:53.990> move<00:00:54.170> the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
adjustments and you can you can move the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.229 
adjustments and you can you can move the
rollers<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.740> and<00:00:54.860> out<00:00:54.950> so<00:00:55.220> wider<00:00:55.490> or<00:00:55.820> or

farther<00:00:56.570> away<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:57.230> mills<00:00:57.410> primarily<00:00:57.920> used

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
farther away the mills primarily used

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.950 
farther away the mills primarily used
for<00:00:58.310> a<00:00:58.460> drill<00:00:58.760> there<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.390> hand<00:00:59.720> crank

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
for a drill there is a hand crank

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.410 
for a drill there is a hand crank
available<00:01:00.470> although<00:01:01.100> we<00:01:01.310> don't<00:01:01.520> recommend<00:01:02.150> it

available although we don't recommend it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.610 
available although we don't recommend it
it's<00:01:02.600> pretty<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.110> pretty<00:01:03.200> time<00:01:03.590> consuming

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
it's pretty it's pretty time consuming

drill<00:01:16.159> at<00:01:16.369> some<00:01:16.729> point<00:01:16.969> so<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:17.780> recommend

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
drill at some point so we recommend

using<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.590> with<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.009> with<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.490> drill<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.659> we

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
using it with the with the drill and we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.480 
using it with the with the drill and we
in<00:01:21.109> this<00:01:21.350> case<00:01:21.560> I'm<00:01:21.710> gonna<00:01:21.799> show<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.009> using<00:01:22.159> a

in this case I'm gonna show you using a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.999 
in this case I'm gonna show you using a
a<00:01:22.670> national<00:01:23.299> cordless<00:01:23.659> drill<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:24.859> here's

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
a national cordless drill and here's

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.919 
a national cordless drill and here's
it's<00:01:25.249> pretty<00:01:25.429> easy<00:01:25.609> to<00:01:25.789> connect<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.389> it<00:01:26.539> so<00:01:26.810> I'm

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
it's pretty easy to connect to it so I'm

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:35.370 
it's pretty easy to connect to it so I'm
gonna<00:01:27.020> go<00:01:27.139> ahead<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.380> show<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.979> how<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:31.219> works

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
and as you can see it does a pretty good

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.750 
and as you can see it does a pretty good
of<00:01:38.270> getting<00:01:38.600> all<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:39.040> getting<00:01:40.040> all<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.400> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
want to make their own you might make a

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.610 
want to make their own you might make a
plywood<00:03:34.519> piece<00:03:35.000> or<00:03:35.510> even<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.930> stand<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.470> some

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
plywood piece or even a stand of some

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.170 
plywood piece or even a stand of some
source<00:03:36.890> we<00:03:37.040> provide<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.730> screws<00:03:38.000> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
source we provide the the screws the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.460 
source we provide the the screws the
stainless<00:03:38.480> steel<00:03:38.600> screws<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.989> go<00:03:39.110> in<00:03:39.260> there

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
stainless steel screws to go in there

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.879 
stainless steel screws to go in there
and<00:03:39.620> then<00:03:40.130> it's<00:03:40.250> up<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.640> mount<00:03:40.760> it

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
and then it's up to you to mount it

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.440 
and then it's up to you to mount it
there's<00:03:42.889> a<00:03:42.950> little<00:03:43.100> bit<00:03:43.250> assembly<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:44.269> put

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
there's a little bit assembly to put

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.789 
there's a little bit assembly to put
into<00:03:44.570> putting<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.049> together<00:03:45.230> as<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.560> little

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
into putting this together as a little

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:46.510 
into putting this together as a little
bit<00:03:45.889> of<00:03:45.950> assembly<00:03:46.280> to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
bit of assembly to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.850 
bit of assembly to
together<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.150> mean<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:47.690> not<00:03:47.780> much<00:03:48.050> just<00:03:48.710> some

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
together I mean it's not much just some

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.530 
together I mean it's not much just some
screws<00:03:49.160> here<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.700> assemble<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.240> actual

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
screws here to assemble the actual

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.240 
screws here to assemble the actual
hopper<00:03:50.870> um<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.650> always<00:03:51.740> want<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:51.950> be<00:03:52.010> careful

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
hopper um you always want to be careful

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.490 
hopper um you always want to be careful
it<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.150> can<00:03:53.330> get<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.540> little<00:03:53.900> bit<00:03:53.990> sharp<00:03:54.260> they

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
it just can get a little bit sharp they

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.530 
it just can get a little bit sharp they
try<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.740> file<00:03:54.980> down<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.550> factory<00:03:55.940> but<00:03:56.120> they

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
try to file down in the factory but they

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.880 
try to file down in the factory but they
can<00:03:56.690> sometimes<00:03:57.020> be<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.200> little<00:03:57.440> sharp<00:03:57.620> as<00:03:57.740> well

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
can sometimes be a little sharp as well

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.950 
can sometimes be a little sharp as well
so<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:58.880> yes<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.300> this<00:03:59.390> is<00:03:59.540> something<00:03:59.840> you'll

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
so but yes and this is something you'll

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.900 
so but yes and this is something you'll
probably<00:03:59.990> buy<00:04:00.380> once<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.920> use<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.730> for<00:04:01.880> a

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
probably buy once and use it for a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.210 
probably buy once and use it for a
lifetime<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.870> course<00:04:03.050> it<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.620> roller

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
lifetime and of course it is a roller

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.860 
lifetime and of course it is a roller
mill<00:04:04.460> you<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.120> roll<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.600> can<00:04:05.720> build

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
mill you can you can roll you can build

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.540 
mill you can you can roll you can build
all<00:04:05.990> kinds<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.320> things<00:04:06.500> corns<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.100> other
