00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.730
 and a goal 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.159

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.570
 extremely pleasure in principle I never created 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 that the sky is upscale like that we also remember to avoid that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 it's been about 30 three and a half months that these machines itunes and its 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.299
 paris afp - dominique de villepin said he was convinced his audience 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.890

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.620
 but I will find a way to help the Ardennes 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.030
 a plus to win more worried about movies which mean video games 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.150
 France took power if this moment came to announce a number more 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.399
 bigger in the nose 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.189

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.139

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.609
 m 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.690

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.699
 I will not do any special among the civilians 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.239

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.729
 French substitutes 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.489
 I think it's going to be something in fact 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.389
 Alas 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.659

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.870
 make a big shot of the sea 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.599

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.810
 the independent 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.810
 it is true that we must do in the next five years 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.199

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.499
 for this first speech in plenary 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.130

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:58.290
 same as I said I'll get me the power not support in flight and that me 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.969
 I've had 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.360
 like everyone on the advice of the dr people I said 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.150
 in one way or another as genius I want I will try to find 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.410
 something nice thing too much for which takes too much time without 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.900
 mention and all 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.410
 decision will start to spark anyway 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.410
 but a danger I will try to do something to help you 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.239
 m and that's it 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.469
 in the eu other than that i can 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.560
 I was more often than not what I had to say about it 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.430
 but staying only a few minutes vincent segal bernard 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.650
 I spoke a little bit 2 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.610
 Monaco 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.050
 black by ford by the hour 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.400
 the percentage is still in favorite spot just called a 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.760
 he's going out in not long 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.349
 so to speak like that 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.830
 and at home simon azoulai really 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.669
 a man because that's this moment with his future free offer will really be to 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:48.300
 to play 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.029
 for its part the battlefield beta 3 days 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.900
 I do not want to spend too much time on it 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.100
 finally to distinguish between the two dates display this scale series call of 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.770
 duty 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.430
 according to them alone however I'm happy it's a job that requires 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.949
 for three months 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.379
 largely from the ump which as you all know 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.620
 On the menu 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.330
 so here I tried it's a little bit of the pop star 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.520
 for you to apply the benefits of her dress with bats Wales 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520
 they are a thousand times only 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.660
 year - mainfroi consorts I'm just going to flee claiming to believe I'm trying to 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.260
 make 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.259
 he passes two ahead 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.389
 for this game 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.389
 for flamengo what you're entertaining 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:32.659
 here is a name that could be a gesture of anti-game for this game 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.169
 it's a simple shock 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.249
 there I really rejoice 1 so I arrived at the beginning he was a little 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:41.560
 little hesitant but 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.099
 and the inhabitants can play they told me it was good 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.580
 e and 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.550
 for me the size for fraud research 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.490
 it's really not that bad and I think it's my part 3,600 dead in 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.770
 2009 if we look at the stage in this stage of the tournament 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.240
 a menu and I'm pretty happy besides confirming that this idea 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.069
 of course change things 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.129

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.789
 hearty weather for the star with years and armpits 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.559

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:17.960

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.369
 mangin majetel 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:20.960
 favorite weapon something 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.639
 going up the avenue mohamed v 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.669
