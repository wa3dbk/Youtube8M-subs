00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300

something<00:02:54.629> in<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.900> that's<00:02:55.140> very<00:02:55.260> appealing

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
something in it that's very appealing

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.479 
something in it that's very appealing
although<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.390> straight<00:02:57.750> curly<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> want

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
although the straight curly that I want

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.479 
although the straight curly that I want
is<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.790> little<00:03:00.349> one-dimensional<00:03:01.349> it's<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
is a little one-dimensional it's it

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.940 
is a little one-dimensional it's it
doesn't<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.180> any<00:03:03.450> variety<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.650> or

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
doesn't have any variety to it or

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.610 
doesn't have any variety to it or
anything<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.370> could<00:03:05.580> see<00:03:05.849> where<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.300> might<00:03:07.200> be<00:03:07.409> a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
anything I could see where it might be a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.330 
anything I could see where it might be a
good<00:03:07.890> idea<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:08.400> me<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.790> look<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.390> some<00:03:10.340> blends

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
good idea for me to look for some blends

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.110 
good idea for me to look for some blends
that<00:03:11.550> are<00:03:12.060> predominantly<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:14.069> burly<00:03:14.849> base

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
that are predominantly a burly base
