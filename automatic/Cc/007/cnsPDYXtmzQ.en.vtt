so<00:01:48.130> since<00:01:49.130> I'm<00:01:49.340> inside<00:01:49.730> I<00:01:49.790> can't<00:01:50.270> actually

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
so since I'm inside I can't actually

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.690 
so since I'm inside I can't actually
test<00:01:51.050> how<00:01:51.350> far<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.800> streets<00:01:52.130> yet<00:01:52.430> because

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
test how far the streets yet because

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.880 
test how far the streets yet because
it's<00:01:52.880> too<00:01:53.120> dark<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.570> rainy<00:01:53.840> outside<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.770> it

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
it's too dark and rainy outside but it

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.280 
it's too dark and rainy outside but it
hit<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.280> window<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.240> from<00:01:56.480> here<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.750> there<00:01:57.110> is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
hit the window so from here to there is

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.710 
hit the window so from here to there is
about<00:01:57.560> 50<00:01:58.010> feet<00:01:58.400> so<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.120> know<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.480> shoots

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
about 50 feet so I know it shoots

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.960 
about 50 feet so I know it shoots
farther<00:02:00.170> than<00:02:00.320> 50<00:02:00.710> feet<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.760> probably

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
farther than 50 feet and it probably

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.820

hold<00:05:28.190> down<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.550> trigger<00:05:32.860> for<00:05:33.860> darts<00:05:34.450> so<00:05:35.470> from

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
hold down the trigger for darts so from

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.879 
hold down the trigger for darts so from
there<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:36.919> here<00:05:36.950> is<00:05:37.280> 50<00:05:37.760> feet<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:39.110> did<00:05:39.470> hit

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
there to here is 50 feet and it did hit

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.950 
there to here is 50 feet and it did hit
the<00:05:39.919> windows<00:05:40.520> so<00:05:40.910> it<00:05:41.060> would<00:05:41.180> go<00:05:41.330> past<00:05:41.660> the

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
the windows so it would go past the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.450 
the windows so it would go past the
window<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:42.919> shoots
