00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
building it build another one just to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.999 
building it build another one just to
trap<00:01:55.259> them<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.619> he's<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.860> come

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
trap them in there so he's going to come

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.319 
trap them in there so he's going to come
around<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> gas<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:56.909> quickly<00:01:57.090> get

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
around to the gas and they quickly get

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.880 
around to the gas and they quickly get
out<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.600> nanny<00:01:58.170> will<00:01:58.320> had<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.560> timing

out of there nanny will had that timing

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.679 
out of there nanny will had that timing
gun<00:01:59.009> pretty<00:01:59.430> well<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> he's

it's going to scout with and out there's

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.249 
it's going to scout with and out there's
two<00:02:04.590> gasps<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:04.890> gas<00:02:05.430> 0<00:02:05.700> gas<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:06.990> any<00:02:07.079> wall

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
two gasps one gas 0 gas so in any wall

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.300 
two gasps one gas 0 gas so in any wall
is<00:02:07.350> definitely<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.890> pretty<00:02:08.039> good<00:02:08.099> position

do<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.440> Banshee<00:03:38.769> we'll<00:03:38.920> see<00:03:39.070> here<00:03:39.280> he's<00:03:39.610> got

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
do the Banshee we'll see here he's got

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.690 
do the Banshee we'll see here he's got
enough<00:03:39.970> gas<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.709> looks<00:03:41.769> like<00:03:42.130> he's<00:03:42.430> just

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
enough gas so it looks like he's just

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.449 
enough gas so it looks like he's just
going<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.970> wait<00:03:43.920> kind<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:44.980> curious<00:03:45.220> he<00:03:45.340> was

a little bit of poking around he's going

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.090 
a little bit of poking around he's going

to see that expansion let's look pretty

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.120 
to see that expansion let's look pretty

opponent just sticks on base it's a

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
little bit

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.790 
little bit
not<00:04:22.479> as<00:04:22.629> effective<00:04:23.080> because<00:04:23.530> they're<00:04:23.680> going

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
not as effective because they're going

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.559 
not as effective because they're going

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:31.029 
so we're going to see an observer slowly

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:32.189 
so we're going to see an observer slowly
