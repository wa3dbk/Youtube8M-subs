um CPU capabilities as well as some
graphics<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> capabilities<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.420> can

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
graphics and capabilities then you can

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.940 
graphics and capabilities then you can
see<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:54.840> ram<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> kind<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.710> hard<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
see my ram there it's kind of hard to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.819 
see my ram there it's kind of hard to
see<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.180> um<00:01:57.420> kingston<00:01:58.350> hyperx

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
see but that is um kingston hyperx

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
see but that is um kingston hyperx
that's<00:01:59.520> 8<00:01:59.759> gigabytes<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.659> 1600

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that's 8 gigabytes of it at 1600

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
that's 8 gigabytes of it at 1600
megahertz<00:02:02.000> it's<00:02:03.000> not<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.329> fastest<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
megahertz it's not the fastest but it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
megahertz it's not the fastest but it
was<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.290> sale<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.130> eighty<00:02:05.369> eight

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
was on sale it was like eighty eight

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.670 
was on sale it was like eighty eight
dollars<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.210> two<00:02:06.360> sticks<00:02:06.659> which<00:02:07.380> did

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
dollars for the two sticks which did

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.880 
dollars for the two sticks which did
help<00:02:07.920> out<00:02:08.069> my<00:02:08.190> budget<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:09.530> think<00:02:10.530> that's<00:02:10.709> just

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
help out my budget I think that's just

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.890 
help out my budget I think that's just
about<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.340> did<00:02:11.489> buy<00:02:11.640> some<00:02:11.910> red<00:02:12.180> SATA<00:02:12.480> cables

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
about it we did buy some red SATA cables

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.520 
about it we did buy some red SATA cables
you<00:02:13.170> could<00:02:13.319> see

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you could see

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.170 
you could see
there<00:02:13.770> because<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.520> didn't<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.000> white

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
there because I didn't like the white

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.630 
there because I didn't like the white
ones<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.720> came<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.490> an

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
ones that it came with but I do have an

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.010 
ones that it came with but I do have an
optical<00:02:17.850> drive<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.630> there<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:18.900> there's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
optical drive up in there but there's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.270 
optical drive up in there but there's
nothing<00:02:19.260> too<00:02:19.350> special<00:02:19.560> they're<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.069> clicks

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
nothing too special they're just clicks

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.680 
nothing too special they're just clicks
the<00:02:20.400> button<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.120> I'm<00:02:21.240> actually<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
the button but I'm actually going to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.600 
the button but I'm actually going to
turn<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.050> off<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.459> can

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
turn this off actually I think I can

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.510 
turn this off actually I think I can
just<00:02:23.790> press<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.959> power<00:02:25.170> button<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.680> Turner

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
just press the power button with Turner

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.860 
just press the power button with Turner

have<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.440> video<00:02:49.680> card<00:02:50.010> not<00:02:50.280> once<00:02:50.489> i<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.850> have

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
have the video card not once i just have

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.090 
have the video card not once i just have
the<00:02:51.000> next<00:02:51.360> two<00:02:51.480> components<00:02:52.019> but<00:02:52.769> i<00:02:52.830> would<00:02:52.980> like

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the next two components but i would like

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.190 
the next two components but i would like
to<00:02:53.310> actually<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.150> completely<00:02:54.690> forgot<00:02:54.780> but

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
to actually I just completely forgot but

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.930 
to actually I just completely forgot but
i'll<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> second<00:02:55.980> part<00:02:56.010> here<00:02:56.340> so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
i'll just do the second part here so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.759 
i'll just do the second part here so
this<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.239> what<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.630> case<00:02:57.989> looks<00:02:58.319> like<00:02:58.530> when

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
this is what the case looks like when

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.740 
this is what the case looks like when
you<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.100> close<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.940> see<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> ram<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
you do close it you do see the ram and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.120 
you do close it you do see the ram and
the<00:03:00.840> apu<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.440> there<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.739> will<00:03:01.860> also<00:03:02.010> be

the apu in there and you will also be

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.920 
the apu in there and you will also be
able<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.459> see<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.790> video<00:03:02.910> card<00:03:03.269> once<00:03:03.480> i<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:03.660> get

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
able to see the video card once i do get

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.509 
able to see the video card once i do get
it<00:03:04.050> but<00:03:04.560> i'm<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:04.800> going<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.160> turn<00:03:05.370> this

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
light out it's going to go pitch black

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.979 
light out it's going to go pitch black
now<00:03:07.920> i'm<00:03:08.040> going<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.480> turn<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.540> on<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.930> can

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
now i'm going to turn it on so you can

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.600 
now i'm going to turn it on so you can
see<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> does<00:03:10.440> glow<00:03:10.590> blue<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.160> top<00:03:11.370> it's

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
see it does glow blue on the top it's

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.009 
see it does glow blue on the top it's
kind<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.850> hard<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.090> see<00:03:12.300> because<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:12.989> a

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
kind of hard to see because it is on a

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.960 
kind of hard to see because it is on a
camera<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.709> actually<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.069> lot<00:03:14.280> nicer<00:03:14.489> in<00:03:14.819> real
