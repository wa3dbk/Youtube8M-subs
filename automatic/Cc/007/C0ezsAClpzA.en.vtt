once<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> take<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.069> disconnect

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
once you take that out you disconnect

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.370 
once you take that out you disconnect

the whities members just the white one

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.340 
the whities members just the white one
cut<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.880> but<00:02:45.330> cut<00:02:45.390> enough<00:02:45.720> off<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.290> have

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
cut it but cut enough off so you have

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.850 
cut it but cut enough off so you have
enough<00:02:46.830> enough<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.900> know<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.110> add<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.500> so

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
enough enough to you know to add on so

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.190 
enough enough to you know to add on so
you<00:02:49.950> cut<00:02:50.130> off<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:51.330> connector<00:02:51.870> any<00:02:52.530> cut<00:02:52.770> off

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
you cut off that connector any cut off

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.530 
you cut off that connector any cut off
then<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> cut<00:02:55.470> off<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:56.610> connector<00:02:57.210> that's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
then you cut off this connector that's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.410 
then you cut off this connector that's
on<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> original<00:02:58.230> harness<00:02:58.970> if<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.000> cut<00:03:00.330> that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
on the original harness if you cut that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.380 
on the original harness if you cut that
off<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.900> buy<00:03:01.140> cut<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.860> off<00:03:02.040> strip<00:03:03.030> some

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
off and buy cut that off strip some

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.280 
off and buy cut that off strip some
wires<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:05.280> got<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.720> strip<00:03:06.720> two<00:03:06.900> wires<00:03:07.110> out

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
wires and you got a strip two wires out

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.570 
wires and you got a strip two wires out
of<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.440> clock<00:03:07.680> spring<00:03:07.890> harness<00:03:10.760> which<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
of the clock spring harness which is a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.760 
of the clock spring harness which is a
focus<00:03:14.580> this<00:03:14.910> right<00:03:16.790> you're<00:03:17.790> gonna<00:03:17.910> trip<00:03:18.770> the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
focus this right you're gonna trip the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.880 
focus this right you're gonna trip the
reading<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.510> green<00:03:21.840> light<00:03:22.260> green<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.860> red

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
reading the green light green with red

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.100 
reading the green light green with red
and<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:25.740> blue<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.400> green<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.990> got

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
and then the blue with green and you got

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.720 
and then the blue with green and you got
a<00:03:28.140> strip<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:29.580> blue<00:03:30.210> with<00:03:30.420> black<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.730> the

go to my horn right here which I have I
have<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> paper<00:03:47.550> clip<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:48.150> extended<00:03:49.040> from

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
have a paper clip just extended from

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.940 
have a paper clip just extended from
there<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:51.600> here<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.170> just<00:03:52.440> enough<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.890> can

there to here and just enough so I can
touch<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.610> know<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.660> we<00:03:54.720> can<00:03:54.870> touch<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.560> back<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
touch I know so we can touch the back of

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.040 
touch I know so we can touch the back of
this<00:03:55.980> thing<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.400> pretty<00:03:57.330> much<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.959> then

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050

once it's all connected and whatever
once<00:04:06.330> it's<00:04:06.480> all<00:04:06.540> connected<00:04:07.010> like<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.280> like

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
once it's all connected like so like

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.110 
once it's all connected like so like
that<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.930> wires<00:04:10.230> are<00:04:10.380> gonna<00:04:10.470> run

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
that this wires are gonna run

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.170 
that this wires are gonna run
corresponding<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:16.010> boom<00:04:17.010> done<00:04:17.520> it<00:04:17.940> gives

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
corresponding to boom done it gives

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.140 
corresponding to boom done it gives
enough<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:19.109> know<00:04:19.230> just<00:04:19.500> reach<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.000> does

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
enough you know just reach it so does

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.020 
enough you know just reach it so does

like<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.630> got<00:04:25.229> this<00:04:25.530> how-to<00:04:25.740> on<00:04:26.100> Ohana

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
like this I got this how-to on Ohana

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.260 
like this I got this how-to on Ohana
Tech<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.770> was<00:04:28.860> pretty<00:04:29.040> nifty<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.639> didn't

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
Tech and it was pretty nifty I didn't

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.270 
Tech and it was pretty nifty I didn't

you get this part done and he shrink
them<00:04:44.820> together<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:46.110> connect<00:04:46.410> this<00:04:46.500> one<00:04:46.710> as

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
them together you connect this one as

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.110 
them together you connect this one as
you<00:04:46.860> can<00:04:46.979> tape<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.280> up<00:04:47.490> it's<00:04:47.669> one<00:04:47.759> woody<00:04:47.940> right

you can tape it up it's one woody right

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.219 
you can tape it up it's one woody right
now<00:04:48.270> tape<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> up<00:04:49.789> plug<00:04:50.789> this<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:52.080> that

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
now tape it up plug this in like that

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.140 
now tape it up plug this in like that
your<00:04:52.590> main<00:04:52.800> back<00:04:53.280> in<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.669> then<00:04:53.759> plug<00:04:54.000> this

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
your main back in and then plug this

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.400 
your main back in and then plug this
behind<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.720> original<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.289> makes<00:04:58.289> the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
behind the original that that makes the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.570 
behind the original that that makes the
harness<00:04:58.680> basically<00:04:58.949> get<00:04:59.100> make<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.310> harness
