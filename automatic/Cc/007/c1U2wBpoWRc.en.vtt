00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello friends a pleasure to be again 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.589
 with you today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.630
 Delicious sweet milk cake I think 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.330
 which is appropriate for the holidays that 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.549
 we come to the end of the year we started with 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.830
 the ingredients half a cup 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:22.920
 butter one and a half cup of sugar 2 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 tablespoons vanilla half a cup 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 oil 3 eggs one cup one quarter 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.940
 milk we have in this container two 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.910
 cups a quarter of all-purpose flour and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.520
 a cup port of cornstarch a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.430
 teaspoon of baking soda two 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.670
 teaspoons of baking powder and a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 teaspoon of salt as you see these three 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.910
 ingredients we include them to the flour and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.879
 then we mix these ingredients with 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.640
 a fork we give a small 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.610
 movement 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.540
 let's put the butter in the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.380
 blender is half a cup of butter 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.830
 with the sugar then we beat until 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.150
 stay creamy and hold a yellow 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.230
 pale 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.910
 add the vanilla 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:25.060
 we continue beating then we incorporate the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:30.710
 oil little by little we continue beating 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:33.890
 the dough becomes more creamy then 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:39.590
 we add the eggs trying to make it 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.980
 one by one we continue beating up 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:48.980
 that the dough is well incorporated 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 let's proceed later with the flour 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.450
 alternately with milk procuring 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.700
 that always ends up in 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.700
 flour and not over beat 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.289
 this is the consistency of the dough 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.360
 we have our cashiers lists that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.230
 are 9 inches previously 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.750
 daubed now let's distribute the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.100
 mass in each one trying to make it 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.770
 then half of each of them 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.189
 let's not forget also that we have to 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:29.319
 heat the oven to 325 degrees 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.650
 how they see more or less the time of 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.599
 cooking is between 30 and 35 minutes and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.450
 look how pretty are the ones that is 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.470
 fine as a golden color 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.780
 very pretty 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.630
 now on our table we put the paper 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.550
 film this is so that it does not stick 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.310
 that is more practical when it comes to cutting 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.070
 we are using the cutter 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.140
 I want it to be more even as you see 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.570
 here we are applying the syrup to the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.060
 first layer of the cake for which no 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.100
 remember or do not know how to make the syrup 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.580
 if at all, leaving our first video of 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.190
 the chocolate cake then let's spread 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.100
 the dulce de leche 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.900
 generously we put everything that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.930
 be even so you have a pretty 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.810
 presentation now we put the second 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.060
 layer is only we put the sweet 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.250
 of milk also try to make sure 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.160
 even and that looks good 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.070
 now yes the third layer in this layer yes 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.250
 let's put the syrup again and the 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.370
 dulce de leche finally we come to the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.090
 last layer here we try to ensure a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.160
 little with our hands so that it is 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.870
 leveled try that you 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.360
 I was a little better because I saw that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.310
 mine is not 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.290
 Now let's prepare the cream 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 butter let's use for this 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.390
 half a cup of butter or a bar 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.200
 of butter then we put one to 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.510
 one and a half cups of powdered sugar 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.420
 let's beat this this is in accordance 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.880
 to your liking there are people who 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.190
 like how in this case is a little 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.520
 thick but for me it's easy to be able 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.920
 anoint who likes a little more 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.380
 soft the cream there is a little secret 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.709
 you can take one or a couple of teaspoons 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.320
 of milk when it's time to beat now 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.440
 to make a decoration we have grabbed 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.820
 the dulce de leche and we have previously 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.980
 diluted a little so you can run 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.810
 already according to your taste this 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.900
 is our idea we have done with a 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.060
 board on the in the cake 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.050

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.820
