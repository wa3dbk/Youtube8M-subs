out<00:00:20.650> in<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.800> fields<00:00:21.250> this<00:00:21.789> is<00:00:21.850> a<00:00:22.000> much<00:00:22.240> cleaner

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
out in the fields this is a much cleaner

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
of the feed lines that was coming out of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.719 
of the feed lines that was coming out of
my<00:01:03.520> balls<00:01:03.820> out<00:01:04.030> there<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:05.350> screwed<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:06.009> your

my balls out there and I screwed in your

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.940 
my balls out there and I screwed in your
system<00:01:07.210> right<00:01:07.390> into<00:01:07.750> where<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.380> was<00:01:08.619> screwing

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
system right into where I was screwing

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.440 
system right into where I was screwing
my<00:01:09.220> fitting<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.820> would<00:01:09.970> come<00:01:10.119> out<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.270> the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
my fitting that would come out of the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.840 
my fitting that would come out of the
that<00:01:10.780> ball<00:01:10.960> valve<00:01:11.289> and<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:12.429> know<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.579> took<00:01:12.729> me

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
that ball valve and you know it took me

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.630 
that ball valve and you know it took me
all<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.179> probably<00:01:13.509> 10<00:01:14.380> minutes<00:01:14.770> though<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.009> put

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
all of probably 10 minutes though to put

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.819 
all of probably 10 minutes though to put
it<00:01:15.759> up<00:01:15.880> by<00:01:16.450> using<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:17.499> was<00:01:17.710> making<00:01:18.549> the

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
it up by using that it was making the

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.230 
it up by using that it was making the
micronutrients<00:01:20.829> more<00:01:21.249> available<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:21.969> the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
micronutrients more available to the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.910 
micronutrients more available to the
plants<00:01:22.689> where<00:01:22.840> they<00:01:22.960> had<00:01:23.109> a<00:01:23.140> problem<00:01:23.740> without

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
plants where they had a problem without

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.779 
plants where they had a problem without
it<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:26.259> was<00:01:26.409> normally<00:01:26.859> taking<00:01:27.219> me<00:01:27.280> about<00:01:27.460> two

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
it what was normally taking me about two

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.179 
it what was normally taking me about two
weeks<00:01:27.819> to<00:01:28.509> transplant<00:01:29.289> them<00:01:29.469> I<00:01:29.649> can<00:01:29.859> cut<00:01:30.069> it

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
weeks to transplant them I can cut it

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.099 
weeks to transplant them I can cut it
down<00:01:30.219> probably<00:01:30.819> another<00:01:31.270> three<00:01:31.539> or<00:01:31.569> four<00:01:31.689> days

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
down probably another three or four days

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.080 
down probably another three or four days
taking<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.799> week<00:01:33.009> off<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.429> plant<00:01:33.700> on<00:01:33.939> an

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
taking a week off the plant on an

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.819 
taking a week off the plant on an
overall<00:01:34.569> like<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.990> time<00:01:35.229> on<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.439> five<00:01:35.619> week

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
overall like the time on a five week

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.029 
overall like the time on a five week
cycle<00:01:36.039> saving<00:01:36.789> time<00:01:36.999> saving<00:01:37.420> money<00:01:37.749> and<00:01:38.039> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
cycle saving time saving money and the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.669 
cycle saving time saving money and the
plants<00:01:39.399> look<00:01:39.609> really<00:01:40.030> nice<00:01:40.210> they<00:01:40.450> were<00:01:40.479> not<00:01:41.409> as

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
plants look really nice they were not as

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.419 
plants look really nice they were not as
green<00:01:42.100> as<00:01:42.909> soon<00:01:43.090> as<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.329> put<00:01:43.569> that<00:01:44.429> magnetic

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
green as soon as I put that magnetic

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.459 
green as soon as I put that magnetic
water<00:01:45.700> device<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.270> there<00:01:46.450> everything<00:01:47.200> greens

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
water device in there everything greens

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.639 
water device in there everything greens
right<00:01:47.679> up<00:01:47.829> you<00:01:48.310> know<00:01:48.399> they're<00:01:48.579> much<00:01:48.759> bigger

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
right up you know they're much bigger

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.940 
right up you know they're much bigger
this<00:01:50.649> is<00:01:50.709> the<00:01:51.039> first<00:01:51.749> seedling<00:01:52.749> crop<00:01:53.079> when<00:01:53.920> I

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
this is the first seedling crop when I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.739 
this is the first seedling crop when I
when<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.369> started<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:55.030> imploder<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.630> that's

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
when I started the imploder and that's

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.719 
when I started the imploder and that's
where<00:01:55.929> I<00:01:55.959> notice<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.499> big<00:01:56.679> difference<00:01:57.069> is<00:01:57.249> you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
where I notice the big difference is you

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.599 
where I notice the big difference is you
know<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:57.850> waited<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.389> two<00:01:58.600> weeks<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.109> to<00:01:59.709> plant

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
know I waited the two weeks to to plant

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.969 
know I waited the two weeks to to plant
