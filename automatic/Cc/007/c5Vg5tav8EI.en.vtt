00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.840
 hello to tutty and from 20 in my kitchen 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.620
 today he has decided to prepare a dessert 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.960
 exactly the cake 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.600
 the yoghurts then the ingredients that 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:24.320
 circulate are three eggs a jar of 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.970
 yogurt and from this moment onwards for 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.360
 to regulate ourselves as if it were not the country 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.829
 all yoghurts for which we will also need 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.890
 if in the jars of flour 2 lemons dude 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.020
 that of course together with ours 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.300
 yeast sachet first 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.059
 we light the oven and then redeem it 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.579
 at 183 now we are going to break ours 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.579
 eggs separating the white from the red 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 so let's go to mount yours 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:09.100
 egg whites until stiff I recommend the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.450
 you see our audience at least and well 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.140
 stop 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.970
 now let's limit the situation for a moment 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 our chat where we put the reds 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.000
 egg energy in ricotta yogurt 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.450
 you want taste that you like and every 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.610
 as fabio as I told you before 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 this will become our unit of 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:36.420
 measure then we go to put three 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 00 flour flour jars 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.869
 no 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.840
 2 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.210
 etc 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:12.900
 then two sugar sugar patients 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:16.830
 granulated in a jar of seed oil 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.430
 because we don't use butter so I do 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.430
 I call the oil 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.310
 and at this point it goes from to put the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.860
 leaven the original recipe that me 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.989
 also sees lemon peel of a 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.860
 grated lemon, however, I didn't like it 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.840
 another taste 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:53.090
 so I decided not to put v6 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:58.129
 like to put it in the yeast and with a 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.480
 We are going to do everything cabin 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.230
 never since when all good 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.690
 ingredients 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:08.000
 at this point we are going to add i 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.940
 whites whipped to kick that a little bit 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.010
 at a time 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.670
 let's go and amalgamate them with the meal 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.139
 a movement from top to bottom 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.450
 this step of whipping i 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:25.189
 Our albums will help us make the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.730
 our sweet beautiful soft as you would see 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.620
 may have reached our egg whites 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.989
 dough will be a little bit more 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.660
 dense 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.750
 at this point I have already prepared myself 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.340
 my buttered and floured mold e 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.340
 I'm going to pour the mixture 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.940
 here our sweet will have to go in 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.130
 oven at 180 degrees for about 40 45 minutes 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.140
 you probably do it before turning out 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.930
 the proof sufficient because as you know 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.910
 not all are the same forli 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.690
 I go to found it and we see each other with 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.360
 little 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.970
 let's do it after 40 minutes the dessert is 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.680
 ready I let it cool and I have it 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.900
 put in this dish 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.520
 now if you want you can complete the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.520
 all with a little bit of icing sugar 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.780
 in this way I hope this recipe 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.360
 you enjoyed it as it could 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.370

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.180
