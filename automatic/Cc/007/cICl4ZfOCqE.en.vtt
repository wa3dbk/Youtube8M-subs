00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.439 
stay on this line line myself up with
that<00:00:22.529> smaller<00:00:22.920> line<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.150> want<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.330> do

that smaller line and all you want to do

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.150 
that smaller line and all you want to do
is<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:24.750> want<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> double<00:00:25.350> jump<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.949> then

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
is you just want to double jump and then

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.679 
is you just want to double jump and then
move<00:00:26.460> forward<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> land<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> small

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
move forward so you land on a small

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.330 
move forward so you land on a small
barrier<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:28.650> once<00:00:28.830> three<00:00:29.039> there<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
barrier and then once three there you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.560 
barrier and then once three there you
can<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.519> double<00:00:29.849> jump<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.179> sprint<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
can just double jump and sprint to the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.209 
can just double jump and sprint to the
right<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> failed<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:31.769> time<00:00:32.009> there

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
right so I failed the first time there

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.470 
right so I failed the first time there
and<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.700> want<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> make<00:00:33.000> sure<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.239> use<00:00:33.270> your

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and you want to make sure you use your

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.850 
and you want to make sure you use your
second<00:00:33.899> double<00:00:34.110> jump<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> little<00:00:34.440> bit<00:00:34.649> later

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
second double jump a little bit later

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.229 
second double jump a little bit later
than<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.160> first<00:00:35.370> double<00:00:35.579> jump<00:00:35.790> not<00:00:35.969> right

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
than your first double jump not right

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.700 
than your first double jump not right
away<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.719> once<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.500> small

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
away and once you're on that small

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
away and once you're on that small
barrier<00:00:38.160> if<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.579> up<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.210> can

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
barrier if you get up on there you can

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.639 
barrier if you get up on there you can
just<00:00:39.390> still<00:00:39.629> double<00:00:39.989> jump<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.350> sprint<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
just still double jump then sprint to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.290 
just still double jump then sprint to
the<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:40.860> onto<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:41.969> once<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.180> here

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the right onto here then once it here

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.549 
the right onto here then once it here
just<00:00:42.420> double<00:00:42.719> jump<00:00:42.899> again<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.410> move

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
just double jump again and then move

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
just double jump again and then move
forward<00:00:43.590> onto<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.520> small<00:00:44.670> barrier<00:00:45.030> right<00:00:45.149> here

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
forward onto a small barrier right here

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.430 
forward onto a small barrier right here
and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.870> double<00:00:46.140> jump<00:00:46.320> move

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and then you can just double jump move

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
and then you can just double jump move
forward<00:00:46.710> again<00:00:46.770> onto<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.520> sky<00:00:47.730> barrier<00:00:48.059> now

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
forward again onto the sky barrier now

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.910 
forward again onto the sky barrier now
from<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.680> two

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
from here you can get in one of two

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700 
from here you can get in one of two
spots<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:50.969> first<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:51.960> onto<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
spots you can first get up onto this

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
spots you can first get up onto this
building<00:00:53.039> over<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.090> double

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
building over there by just double

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.689 
building over there by just double
jumping<00:00:54.690> than<00:00:54.870> sprinting<00:00:55.260> forward<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.800> once

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
jumping than sprinting forward on once

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.220 
jumping than sprinting forward on once
or<00:00:56.850> twice<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.239> get<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> building<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
or twice to get off on the building and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.660 
or twice to get off on the building and
once<00:00:58.770> i<00:00:58.829> hear<00:00:58.949> i'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> show<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.370> spot

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
once i hear i'm going to show you spot

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.010 
once i hear i'm going to show you spot
later<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> video<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.870> those

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
later in the video that you get on those

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
later in the video that you get on those
trucks<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> second<00:01:02.670> spot<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> definitely

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
trucks but the second spot is definitely

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.399 
trucks but the second spot is definitely
the<00:01:03.300> better<00:01:03.420> spot<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.049> actually<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the better spot you can actually just

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.920 
the better spot you can actually just
strafe<00:01:05.010> jump<00:01:05.040> onto<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.640> big<00:01:05.939> cylinder<00:01:06.659> thing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
strafe jump onto this big cylinder thing

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
strafe jump onto this big cylinder thing
and<00:01:07.310> once<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.820> actually

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and once you're here you can actually

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
and once you're here you can actually
get<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> map<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.619> cool

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
get out of the map which is really cool

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
get out of the map which is really cool
but<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.400> also<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> good<00:01:11.760> spot<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> stay

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
but it's also a good spot just to stay

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
but it's also a good spot just to stay
here<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.049> obviously<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.830> probably

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
here because obviously people probably

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.070 
here because obviously people probably
cannot<00:01:15.030> kill<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.509> their<00:01:15.600> spike<00:01:15.840> drones

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
cannot kill you with their spike drones

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
cannot kill you with their spike drones
unless<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> retracting<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.250> um<00:01:17.430> but

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
unless they get a retracting one um but

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.520 
unless they get a retracting one um but
if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.020> map<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.350> just

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
if you want to get that map you can just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
if you want to get that map you can just
come<00:01:19.619> over<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.520> over<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:20.729> poles<00:01:21.060> are

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
come over here go over these poles are

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
come over here go over these poles are

best spot in my opinion you can actually
go<00:01:55.229> inside<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.829> box<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.759> people

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
go inside this box right here and people

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
go inside this box right here and people
can<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.509> shoot<00:01:57.750> spiked<00:01:58.140> runs<00:01:58.380> through<00:01:58.619> so

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
can not shoot spiked runs through so

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.709 
can not shoot spiked runs through so
it's<00:01:58.890> great<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.159> infected<00:01:59.700> people<00:02:00.210> also<00:02:00.420> tend

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's great for infected people also tend

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.660 
it's great for infected people also tend
to<00:02:01.170> pile<00:02:01.439> up<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.770> certain<00:02:02.070> areas<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.549> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
to pile up in certain areas so you can

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.039 
to pile up in certain areas so you can
just<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.149> kills<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.719> easily

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
just get a lot of kills really easily

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.410 
just get a lot of kills really easily
and<00:02:04.259> yeah<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> keep<00:02:05.880> following<00:02:06.090> around

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
and yeah so if you keep following around

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.210 
and yeah so if you keep following around
that<00:02:06.570> building<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that building you can get over here and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.589 
that building you can get over here and
