front mid-range and tweeter I decided to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.979 
front mid-range and tweeter I decided to
use<00:00:33.020> another<00:00:34.020> vacuum<00:00:34.920> form<00:00:35.370> piece<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.540> house

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
use another vacuum form piece to house

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.869 
use another vacuum form piece to house
the<00:00:37.290> mids<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> tweeters<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the mids and the tweeters now the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.350 
the mids and the tweeters now the
mid-range<00:00:39.329> needs<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.899> specific<00:00:40.530> size

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
mid-range needs a specific size

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
mid-range needs a specific size
enclosure<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.719> order<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> play<00:00:43.350> properly<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
enclosure in order to play properly and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
enclosure in order to play properly and
so<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> decided<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> combine<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.350> by

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so I decided to combine the two by

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.729 
so I decided to combine the two by
creating<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.340> mid<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> tweet<00:00:49.640> housing<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
creating a mid and tweet housing out of

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.110 
creating a mid and tweet housing out of
also<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> lot<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> styrene<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> original

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
also a lot of styrene but the original

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.549 
also a lot of styrene but the original
mold<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> shape<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.949> created<00:00:56.460> using

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
mold and the shape is created using

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.369 
mold and the shape is created using
simple<00:00:58.559> mdf<00:00:59.070> pucks<00:00:59.460> these<00:01:00.030> pucks<00:01:00.359> were<00:01:00.629> housed

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
simple mdf pucks these pucks were housed

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
simple mdf pucks these pucks were housed
in<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.010> wave<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:03.120> ground<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.870> both

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
in a wave and then ground to both

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.580 
in a wave and then ground to both
contour<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:06.000> looking<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.600> using<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
contour that I was looking for using a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.399 
contour that I was looking for using a
die<00:01:07.770> grinder<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> lathe<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:10.170> gives

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
die grinder and the lathe and that gives

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.260 
die grinder and the lathe and that gives
us<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> calm<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.189> know<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> side<00:01:11.760> profile

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
us the calm you know the side profile

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.560 
us the calm you know the side profile
contour<00:01:13.100> roughly<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
contour roughly and then from there just

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.499 
contour roughly and then from there just
smooth<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:17.009> grit<00:01:17.790> sandpaper<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
smooth down with a grit sandpaper and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
smooth down with a grit sandpaper and
then<00:01:18.869> maybe<00:01:19.140> finished<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> 150<00:01:20.729> grit

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
then maybe finished up with a 150 grit

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
then maybe finished up with a 150 grit

if<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.290> they're<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> same

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920

height this one's actually quarter inch
taller<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> give<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.159> little<00:01:41.310> bit

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
taller just to give it a little bit

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.069 
taller just to give it a little bit
a different<00:01:42.680> look<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:43.579> space<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.270> pucks

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
a different look in space the pucks

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.350 
a different look in space the pucks
after<00:01:45.680> i<00:01:45.710> finished<00:01:46.250> sanded<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.670> were<00:01:46.850> resin

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
after i finished sanded and were resin

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.080 
after i finished sanded and were resin
and<00:01:47.509> what<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.140> does<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.560> allows<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.520> pull

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
and what that does it allows you to pull

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.370 
and what that does it allows you to pull
the<00:01:51.159> pull<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.310> molds<00:01:52.700> off<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.570> without<00:01:54.079> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
the pull the molds off of it without the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.910 
the pull the molds off of it without the
MDF<00:01:54.829> separating<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:55.820> I<00:01:55.850> resin<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.409> piece<00:01:57.619> just

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
MDF separating so I resin the piece just

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.649 
MDF separating so I resin the piece just
to<00:01:58.009> get<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.220> little<00:01:58.460> bit<00:01:58.610> extra<00:01:58.850> strength<00:01:59.299> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
to get a little bit extra strength and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.370 
to get a little bit extra strength and
then<00:02:00.049> sanded<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.619> smooth<00:02:01.009> with<00:02:01.789> my<00:02:02.360> 220<00:02:02.990> grit

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
then sanded it smooth with my 220 grit

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.679 
then sanded it smooth with my 220 grit
sandpaper<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.820> then<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.179> made<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> little

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
sandpaper and then I made a little

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.320 
sandpaper and then I made a little
bridge<00:02:05.960> between<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.500> two<00:02:06.829> because<00:02:07.220> if<00:02:08.149> you

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
bridge between the two because if you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.270 
bridge between the two because if you
notice<00:02:08.660> there's<00:02:08.929> no<00:02:09.110> wires<00:02:09.380> visible<00:02:10.009> on<00:02:10.220> the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
notice there's no wires visible on the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.500 
notice there's no wires visible on the
pod<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.110> what<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.319> does<00:02:12.769> is<00:02:13.269> get<00:02:14.269> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
pod and so what that does is get the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.620 
pod and so what that does is get the
tweeter<00:02:14.900> wire<00:02:15.170> passage<00:02:15.799> and<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.790> similar<00:02:17.390> to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
tweeter wire passage and so similar to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.420 
tweeter wire passage and so similar to
the<00:02:18.610> styrene<00:02:20.290> trim<00:02:21.290> pieces<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.890> trunk<00:02:22.190> i

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
the styrene trim pieces in the trunk i

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.690 
the styrene trim pieces in the trunk i
created<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.420> housing<00:02:24.019> using<00:02:24.560> styrene<00:02:25.220> because

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
created a housing using styrene because

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.100 
created a housing using styrene because
if<00:02:25.959> Cyrene<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:26.989> probably<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.860> most

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
if Cyrene is probably one of the most

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.630 
if Cyrene is probably one of the most
pliable<00:02:30.110> materials<00:02:31.069> when<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.340> comes<00:02:31.519> to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
pliable materials when it comes to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.940 
pliable materials when it comes to
vacuum<00:02:31.970> forming<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.349> use<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> thicker

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
vacuum forming but I use a thicker

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.750 
vacuum forming but I use a thicker
material<00:02:34.489> about<00:02:34.700> an<00:02:34.819> eighth<00:02:35.000> inch<00:02:35.269> thick

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
material about an eighth inch thick

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.979 
material about an eighth inch thick
material<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.000> you're<00:02:38.330> having<00:02:38.900> a

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
material so that you're having a

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.930 
material so that you're having a
frigidity<00:02:39.410> after<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.220> vacuum<00:02:40.640> forming

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
frigidity after the vacuum forming

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.780 
frigidity after the vacuum forming
process<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.310> speaker<00:02:43.310> housing

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
process that the speaker housing

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.289 
process that the speaker housing
wouldn't<00:02:44.290> resume<00:02:45.290> pull<00:02:46.040> these<00:02:46.220> molds<00:02:47.180> off

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
wouldn't resume pull these molds off

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.710 
wouldn't resume pull these molds off
pretty<00:02:48.019> easily<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.850> keyed<00:02:50.180> up<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.450> styrene

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
pretty easily and keyed up the styrene

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.849 
pretty easily and keyed up the styrene
in<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.140> same<00:02:52.420> same<00:02:53.420> way<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.470> use<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> heat

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
in the same same way you can use a heat

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.410 
in the same same way you can use a heat
gun<00:02:54.890> or<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:57.280> infrared<00:02:58.280> heating<00:02:58.970> area

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
gun or we have a infrared heating area

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.229 
gun or we have a infrared heating area
so<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.200> allows<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:00.890> keep<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.430> styrene

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
so that allows you to keep the styrene

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.289 
so that allows you to keep the styrene
and<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:03.200> sucks<00:03:03.470> right<00:03:03.709> over<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.100> shape<00:03:04.310> and

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
and it sucks right over the shape and

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.229 
and it sucks right over the shape and
then<00:03:05.480> saying<00:03:05.870> using<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.350> same<00:03:06.560> technique<00:03:07.040> I

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
then saying using the same technique I

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.910 
then saying using the same technique I
trimmed<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:10.389> styrene<00:03:11.389> with<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> router<00:03:12.650> bit

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
trimmed the styrene with a router bit

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.729 
trimmed the styrene with a router bit
and<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.370> bearing<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.109> that<00:03:15.109> allows<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.620> to

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
and a bearing and that allows you to

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.460 
and a bearing and that allows you to
have<00:03:15.859> really<00:03:16.790> clean<00:03:17.030> edge<00:03:17.269> another<00:03:18.200> cool

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
have really clean edge another cool

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.720 
have really clean edge another cool
aspect<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:20.170> tweeter<00:03:21.170> pod<00:03:21.730> relatively

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
aspect of the tweeter pod relatively

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.340 
aspect of the tweeter pod relatively
cool<00:03:22.940> aspect<00:03:23.389> is<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:23.600> you<00:03:23.900> don't<00:03:23.989> see<00:03:24.200> the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
cool aspect is that you don't see the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.069 
cool aspect is that you don't see the
wires<00:03:24.560> because<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.340> mounting<00:03:25.880> bolt<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.840> a

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
wires because the mounting bolt is a

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.370 
wires because the mounting bolt is a
custom<00:03:27.560> threaded<00:03:28.190> half<00:03:29.030> inch<00:03:29.299> rod<00:03:29.660> with<00:03:30.350> a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
custom threaded half inch rod with a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.800 
custom threaded half inch rod with a
washer<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.489> created<00:03:31.760> my<00:03:32.000> own<00:03:32.030> bolt<00:03:32.480> with<00:03:32.780> a

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
washer so I created my own bolt with a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.620 
washer so I created my own bolt with a
quarter-inch<00:03:33.260> passage<00:03:33.889> so<00:03:34.519> even<00:03:35.150> after<00:03:35.329> you

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
quarter-inch passage so even after you

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.410 
quarter-inch passage so even after you
tighten<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.170> bolt<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.709> place<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.819> wires<00:03:38.090> can

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
tighten the bolt in place the wires can

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.860 
tighten the bolt in place the wires can
run<00:03:38.660> through<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.170> bolt

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
run through the bolt

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.690 
run through the bolt
makes<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:41.860> can<00:03:42.629> have<00:03:43.629> no<00:03:44.290> water<00:03:44.700> for

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
makes it so you can have no water for

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.289 
makes it so you can have no water for
the<00:03:45.849> trim<00:03:46.090> ring<00:03:46.920> it's<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:48.010> trim<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.790> mounting

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
the trim ring it's a trim and a mounting

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.979 
the trim ring it's a trim and a mounting
ring<00:03:49.569> so<00:03:50.049> what<00:03:50.470> all<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.680> did<00:03:51.069> was<00:03:51.099> create<00:03:51.959> take<00:03:52.959> a

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
ring so what all I did was create take a

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.220 
ring so what all I did was create take a
copy<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.519> outer<00:03:54.760> flange<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.629> then<00:03:56.049> in

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
copy of the outer flange and then in

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.839 
copy of the outer flange and then in
order<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.620> give<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:56.980> little<00:03:57.129> bit<00:03:57.400> extra

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
order to give it a little bit extra

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.360 
order to give it a little bit extra
shape<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.390> just<00:03:58.629> wrapped<00:03:58.900> fine<00:03:59.650> line<00:03:59.890> quarter

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
shape I just wrapped fine line quarter

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.119 
shape I just wrapped fine line quarter
inch<00:04:00.489> fine<00:04:00.700> line<00:04:00.940> tape<00:04:01.209> around<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.829> 10<00:04:02.829> times

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
inch fine line tape around it 10 times

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.610 
inch fine line tape around it 10 times
to<00:04:03.579> give<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.879> a<00:04:03.940> little<00:04:04.120> X<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.540> thickness<00:04:04.959> so

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
to give it a little X of thickness so

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.819 
to give it a little X of thickness so
when<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:08.010> mold<00:04:09.010> or<00:04:09.400> when<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:10.000> trim<00:04:10.239> piece<00:04:10.480> is

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
when the mold or when the trim piece is

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.949 
when the mold or when the trim piece is
finished<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:12.310> has<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.879> little<00:04:13.180> bit<00:04:13.359> of<00:04:13.420> an<00:04:13.629> extra

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
finished it has a little bit of an extra

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.560 
finished it has a little bit of an extra
lip<00:04:14.260> around<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.890> outer<00:04:15.129> edge<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:16.239> it's<00:04:16.389> not

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
lip around the outer edge so it's not

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.340 
lip around the outer edge so it's not
flush<00:04:17.019> with<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.979> cup<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.239> was<00:04:19.419> painted

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
flush with the cup and that was painted

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:32.370 
flush with the cup and that was painted
the<00:04:20.949> same<00:04:21.190> color<00:04:21.729> as<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.180> wheels<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.229> see
