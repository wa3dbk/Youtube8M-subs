00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
look at what these things really do

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.900 
look at what these things really do
aerodynamically<00:01:31.520> aerodynamics<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> much

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
aerodynamically aerodynamics is much

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.390 
aerodynamically aerodynamics is much
more<00:01:33.180> than<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.570> pushing<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:34.020> frontal<00:01:34.380> area<00:01:34.710> 60

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
more than just pushing a frontal area 60

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.220 
more than just pushing a frontal area 60
miles<00:01:35.580> an<00:01:35.760> hour<00:01:35.820> into<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.270> headwind<00:01:36.660> you<00:01:37.140> also

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
miles an hour into a headwind you also

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.230 
miles an hour into a headwind you also
most<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.010> time<00:01:38.160> have<00:01:38.340> crosswinds<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
most of the time have crosswinds that

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
most of the time have crosswinds that
can<00:01:39.360> play<00:01:39.510> havoc<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.110> overall<00:01:40.560> fuel<00:01:40.890> economy

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
can play havoc on overall fuel economy

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
can play havoc on overall fuel economy
and<00:01:41.520> aerodynamics<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.810> about<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and aerodynamics you think about that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.690 
and aerodynamics you think about that
crosswind<00:01:43.680> getting<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.010> underneath<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> cab

underneath the the truck itself and it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
underneath the the truck itself and it
could<00:01:47.190> really<00:01:47.340> affect<00:01:47.640> fuel<00:01:48.120> economy<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.170> what

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
could really affect fuel economy so what

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.720 
could really affect fuel economy so what
we<00:01:49.440> did<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.770> developed<00:01:50.280> these<00:01:50.370> chassis

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
we did is we developed these chassis

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.630 
we did is we developed these chassis
side<00:01:51.450> fairings<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.020> skirts<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:52.830> keep<00:01:53.400> them

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
side fairings and skirts that keep them

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
side fairings and skirts that keep them
and<00:01:53.850> manage<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> airflow<00:01:54.870> underneath<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
and manage the airflow underneath the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.680 
and manage the airflow underneath the
truck<00:01:55.770> these<00:01:56.280> skirts<00:01:56.610> keep<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.300> air<00:01:57.420> from

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
truck these skirts keep the air from

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.330 
truck these skirts keep the air from
getting<00:01:57.960> underneath<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> cab<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.220> on

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
getting underneath the cab and then on

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.600 
getting underneath the cab and then on
the<00:01:59.460> chassis<00:01:59.790> side<00:02:00.120> fairing<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.720> keeps<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
the chassis side fairing it keeps the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.560 
the chassis side fairing it keeps the
crosswinds<00:02:02.610> from<00:02:02.850> getting<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.330> fuel

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
crosswinds from getting into the fuel

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.090 
crosswinds from getting into the fuel
tanks<00:02:03.990> getting<00:02:04.260> into<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.500> toolboxes

everything<00:02:05.400> else<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.670> mounted<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
everything else you have mounted on the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.150 
everything else you have mounted on the
truck<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.750> cover<00:02:06.960> those<00:02:07.140> things<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.560> provide

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
truck you cover those things up provide

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800 
truck you cover those things up provide
a<00:02:08.190> nice<00:02:08.369> smooth<00:02:08.640> surface<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.569> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
a nice smooth surface like that and you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.270 
a nice smooth surface like that and you
really<00:02:10.050> control<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.679> aerodynamic

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
really control the aerodynamic

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.040 
really control the aerodynamic
performance<00:02:11.430> especially<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.420> crosswinds

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.479 
performance especially with crosswinds
now<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.739> other<00:02:13.769> features<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.340> have

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
now one of the other features we have

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.149 
now one of the other features we have
here<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.510> an<00:02:15.720> optional<00:02:16.200> ground<00:02:16.799> effects

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
here is this an optional ground effects

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.709 
here is this an optional ground effects
kit<00:02:17.280> that's<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.849> bottom<00:02:17.999> it's<00:02:18.359> a<00:02:18.450> rubber

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
kit that's on the bottom it's a rubber

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.110 
kit that's on the bottom it's a rubber
tipped<00:02:19.290> piece<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.890> will<00:02:20.400> flex<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:20.909> hit

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
tipped piece that will flex if you hit

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.770 
tipped piece that will flex if you hit
curbs<00:02:21.359> and<00:02:21.569> stuff

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
curbs and stuff

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.199 
curbs and stuff
but<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.530> helps<00:02:22.800> manage<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.610> air<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
but really helps manage the air that

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.650 
but really helps manage the air that
moves<00:02:24.390> underneath<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> truck<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.390> now<00:02:27.480> let's

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
moves underneath the truck so now let's

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.180 
moves underneath the truck so now let's
take<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> look<00:02:28.050> at<00:02:28.170> some<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> design

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
take a look at some of the design

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.400 
take a look at some of the design
aspects<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.940> 5700<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.080> make<00:02:31.260> it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
aspects of the 5700 that really make it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.500 
aspects of the 5700 that really make it
an<00:02:31.590> aerodynamic<00:02:32.250> performer<00:02:32.730> remember<00:02:33.390> we

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
an aerodynamic performer remember we

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.570 
an aerodynamic performer remember we
mentioned<00:02:33.870> earlier<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.430> aerodynamics<00:02:35.430> is

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
mentioned earlier that aerodynamics is

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.280 
mentioned earlier that aerodynamics is
sometimes<00:02:35.910> deceiving<00:02:36.420> well<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.080> one<00:02:37.200> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
sometimes deceiving well this is one of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.740 
sometimes deceiving well this is one of
those<00:02:37.350> areas<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:38.190> front<00:02:38.520> bumper<00:02:38.910> piece<00:02:39.120> has

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
those areas this front bumper piece has

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.270 
those areas this front bumper piece has
this<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:40.140> Ridge<00:02:40.350> on<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.069> is<00:02:41.160> what

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
this little Ridge on it and this is what

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400 
this little Ridge on it and this is what
we<00:02:41.370> call<00:02:41.489> our<00:02:41.610> front<00:02:41.850> Fang<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.720> ridge<00:02:43.020> works
