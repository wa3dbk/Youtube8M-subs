00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.990
 head of state brought to light I propose you to work today and on a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.940
 piece 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.730
 caron of the famous 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.859
 standards 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.019
 jean ii 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.459
 it's a sad thing 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.459
 it is of course about him and silly 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.659
 then connected to four cores cuda core cores 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.669
 we are going to play two agreements are on cartons 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.669
 I do it to you and by peeling his apprentice 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.800
 then the agreements are 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.990
 but following in C major 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.979
 so here you go 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.989
 when it comes to making two chords by measure I'm talking about walls of course 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.040
 four times 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.130
 so it will be two times by agreement 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.590
 it's always about the tension not to ring 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.049
 to the smooth rope rando 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.469
 okay then there are several techniques for choking that rope either you 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.580
 leave a little drag your thumb 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 this is how I have more politics 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.939
 is 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.810
 as you can with the your third must 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990
 touched the rope slightly 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.090
 so as to stifle it too this is my time contract on the back 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.780
 major 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.780
 then a single major 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.070
 then there are several ways to do it 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 in G major a simple movement 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.799
 very pro probably marked 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.910
 so mans-bordeaux it's easier to follow 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.790
 e only one major in this position site 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.900
 the name of take your 3 2 the four 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.240
 the position that I did just before leaving this one 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.370
 where do you take your time 2 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.270
 1 3 p 4 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.080
 it's the same agreement the civilian hearings 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.180
 so running thanks to two agreements afp 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.280
 to change 3 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 we're going to a major stop 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.259
 be careful not to ring the first two strings 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.959
 so make do with the thumb 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.959
 a little more precision with the right hand 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.679
 then robert to the major 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.390
 well personal a fundamental every time 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.560
 by then fundamental it's the fifth string again not to do 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.109
 ring the 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.279
 the half agreement 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.599
 lyon ends with an imager where the sum is also strings without problem 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.449
 I want to do it again at tempo 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.449
 kim less fast 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.369
 worst no 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.579
 see because here 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.129
 several clearances 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 Karzai 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.119
 ten years ago that c 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.499
 the concatenations for the simplest 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.739
 okay 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.959
 how can we transpose all these agreements? 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.259
 rope contest a way to approach the bars and 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.909
 in a simpler way it is obviously necessary to know the notes well 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.449
 on the neck 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.340
 so that tells you to pay attention to your major back theme 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.569
 other to know that you know that there is among all between israel and a 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.059
 turn around between 6 and water so it applies everywhere on the guitar 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.989
 so if I take again arises 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.999
 all open kombuare agreements 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.999
 anto corsa real worries 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.260
 as soon as it's the same position you moved and in this case it's 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.989
 precisely that piece 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.279
 because in fact it's the same displacement every time so you 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.659
 see that back massol 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.609
 I climbed a rope 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.609
 then I do not recreate the same operation 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.919
 true there 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.949
 since the myth and the player of measures 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.599
 now here if you want to get started 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.080
 you add the third 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.650
 third tier major this is only major positions so it's good 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.340
 a good piece to work you curl 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.650
 many are major on the fifth string 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.099
 and major position 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.710
 for the sixth corner 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.710
 I do it once 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.819
 it is at the level of the technique would you are often many to ask 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.159
 when it happens on the level of the right hand it is true that it is not always 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:08.509
 obvious 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.310
 especially if we do not have the basics so 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.230
 here you can think very simple 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.990
 simply play the times 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.339
 at the level of the right hand 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.339
 so it will be every time we go down 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 but in any case at the beginning you can think like that 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.430
 so I remember that it is more important 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.919
 two weeks of his season with your foot 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.489
 try to respect baptism so the tempo his speed at which we play 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.550
 obviously if you 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.069
 you have a metronome at home it's even better so the you put 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.110
 the metronome 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.520
 not too fast and you try to 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.120
 play with csa is the goal 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.309
 obviously 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.199
 the now going on and he has completed a little rhythmic so on 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.479
 the bed 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.479
 so I get the Bordeaux wines 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.639
 but here I can do 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.569
 at the bar to drink 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.569
 so I give you his consent 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.240
 why why 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.999
 by launching this room 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:11.129
 e these gp containers measure 14 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.210
 so you have to think when you play a rhythmic 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.379
 you do not just have to move 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.379
 we must always try to dissect so 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.819
 I've been doing semiquavers for three years now 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.020
 I remember a little reminder so the blacks I'm on time 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.020
 okay along with the fags if I know the loved ones 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.249
 p throats play time and mishap 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.559
 so I have doubles having nothing to split so it's double 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:42.809
 eighth c4 the starter so that's one of 3 14% to a people 

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:47.589
 but actually if you think about it to play 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.949
 to recognize them 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.059
 a little sentence to finish the loop hello did it once 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.050
 so I redo you 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.069
 so to be saying that take the first measure of the myth 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.069
 his ferrari 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:33.659
 so here I will be the little sentence on the third half time 

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:36.300
 it's simply yes 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.899
 holtby sales 

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:38.729
 here 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.729
 you're going to just make corbett from there 

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:46.419
 and you take the carnelian beuc so you do there am sorry on the 2 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:47.499
 th break 

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:50.189
 the one look for note 6 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:53.189
 bn his sole will grant in itself empty 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.759
 two times 

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.349
 but the third fair 

00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:01.349
 when we arrive directly on the back 

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:04.749
 that's good fun
