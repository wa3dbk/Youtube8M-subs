00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
so here's why it's so much better for me

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.160 
so here's why it's so much better for me

stroller<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.910> did<00:03:13.450> emboss<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:15.370> pieces<00:03:16.150> here

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
stroller I did emboss the pieces here

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.710 
stroller I did emboss the pieces here
and<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.900> did<00:03:17.110> this<00:03:17.440> with<00:03:17.500> dots<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.760> then

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and I did this with dots here and then

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.660 
and I did this with dots here and then
what<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.900> did<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.560> only<00:03:20.800> glued<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.340> down<00:03:21.490> on

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
what I did is I only glued it down on

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.060 
what I did is I only glued it down on
the<00:03:21.790> bottom<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.350> recalls<00:03:23.710> a<00:03:23.830> little

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
the bottom so that it recalls a little

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.310 
the bottom so that it recalls a little
tags<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:25.090> I'm<00:03:25.240> just<00:03:25.480> now<00:03:25.600> noticing<00:03:26.050> that<00:03:26.260> I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
tags and I'm just now noticing that I

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.600 
tags and I'm just now noticing that I
probably<00:03:26.590> could<00:03:26.800> do<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> better<00:03:27.160> glue<00:03:27.400> job

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
probably could do a better glue job

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.980 
probably could do a better glue job
because<00:03:27.850> they<00:03:27.970> show<00:03:28.150> down<00:03:28.360> on<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.570> bottom<00:03:28.720> so

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
because they show down on the bottom so

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.810 
because they show down on the bottom so
I'll<00:03:29.140> fix<00:03:29.380> that

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
I'll fix that

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.550 
I'll fix that

like like an addiction but you can see
one<00:06:25.009> of<00:06:25.039> the<00:06:25.219> four<00:06:25.430> techniques<00:06:25.879> that<00:06:26.240> I<00:06:26.270> really

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
one of the four techniques that I really

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.930 
one of the four techniques that I really
really<00:06:27.110> liked<00:06:27.289> in<00:06:27.529> this<00:06:27.710> is<00:06:28.340> when<00:06:28.639> you<00:06:28.759> make

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
really liked in this is when you make

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.269 
really liked in this is when you make
the<00:06:29.180> folders<00:06:29.779> you<00:06:30.110> make<00:06:30.319> little<00:06:30.590> ribbon<00:06:31.009> loops

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:31.279 
the folders you make little ribbon loops

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.209 
the folders you make little ribbon loops
and<00:06:32.089> it's<00:06:32.539> a<00:06:32.599> little<00:06:32.870> tedious<00:06:33.110> but<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:33.889> think

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
and it's a little tedious but I think

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.040 
and it's a little tedious but I think
for<00:06:34.399> this<00:06:34.520> kind<00:06:34.789> of<00:06:34.909> a<00:06:35.000> book<00:06:35.240> it<00:06:35.449> just<00:06:35.659> has<00:06:35.810> the

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
for this kind of a book it just has the

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.270 
for this kind of a book it just has the
right

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
right

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
I really adore that and then the very

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.910 
I really adore that and then the very
last<00:06:39.490> thing<00:06:40.030> I<00:06:40.480> actually<00:06:41.050> used<00:06:41.470> a<00:06:41.620> different

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
last thing I actually used a different

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.260 
last thing I actually used a different
Cricut<00:06:42.900> cartridge<00:06:43.900> this<00:06:44.230> is<00:06:44.710> the<00:06:45.639> fancy

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
Cricut cartridge this is the fancy

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.690 
Cricut cartridge this is the fancy
frames<00:06:46.690> and<00:06:47.470> when<00:06:47.889> I<00:06:47.919> got<00:06:48.100> the<00:06:48.250> cartridge<00:06:48.580> I

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
frames and when I got the cartridge I

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.430 
frames and when I got the cartridge I
thought<00:06:48.880> when<00:06:49.150> would<00:06:49.360> you<00:06:49.510> ever<00:06:49.690> use<00:06:49.900> that

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440

thought when would you ever use that
frame<00:06:50.710> I<00:06:50.860> didn't<00:06:51.130> think<00:06:51.250> it<00:06:51.430> was<00:06:51.550> very

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
frame I didn't think it was very

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.490 
frame I didn't think it was very
attractive<00:06:51.820> but<00:06:52.450> it<00:06:52.480> turns<00:06:52.780> out<00:06:52.960> I've<00:06:53.230> used

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660
