you'll<00:01:56.399> need<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> let<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> set<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> while<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you'll need to let it set for a while in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
you'll need to let it set for a while in
the<00:01:57.899> case<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> adhesive<00:01:58.770> I'm<00:01:58.920> using<00:01:59.189> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the case of the adhesive I'm using I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
the case of the adhesive I'm using I
need<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.119> let<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.329> set<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:01.380> 24

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
need you to let it set up for about 24

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.609 
need you to let it set up for about 24
hours<00:02:02.270> now<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.689> simply<00:02:04.020> peeling<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
hours now I'm just simply peeling the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.380 
hours now I'm just simply peeling the
tape<00:02:04.649> off<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> inspect<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
tape off and I'm going to inspect the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.240 
tape off and I'm going to inspect the
work<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.110> far<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.680> make<00:02:07.829> sure<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.099> we're

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
work so far just to make sure that we're

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.570 
work so far just to make sure that we're
on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:08.550> track

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
on the right track

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.940 
on the right track
if<00:02:09.640> you're<00:02:10.330> satisfied<00:02:10.570> with<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.170> initial<00:02:11.680> fit

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
if you're satisfied with the initial fit

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.640 
if you're satisfied with the initial fit
now<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:12.400> time<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.670> use<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.480> larger<00:02:14.110> amount<00:02:14.350> of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
now it's time to use a larger amount of

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.390 
now it's time to use a larger amount of
adhesive<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.730> back<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.210> grille<00:02:16.540> the

adhesive on the back of the grille the
perfects<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.610> per<00:02:19.150> SM<00:02:19.720> materials<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.350> we're

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
perfects and per SM materials that we're

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.710 
perfects and per SM materials that we're
using<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.070> demonstration<00:02:21.370> are<00:02:22.000> great

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
using in this demonstration are great

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.840 
using in this demonstration are great
for<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.020> grille<00:02:23.230> lettering<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.310> materials

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
for the grille lettering the materials

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.910 
for the grille lettering the materials
flat<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.510> against<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.990> flat<00:02:26.230> letters<00:02:26.590> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
flat and against the flat letters it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.610 
flat and against the flat letters it
creates<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.580> pocket<00:02:27.880> for<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.420> adhesive<00:02:29.050> to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
creates a pocket for the adhesive to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.790 
creates a pocket for the adhesive to
easily<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.160> into<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.960> while<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:31.990> do<00:02:32.320> want<00:02:32.710> to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
easily go into and while I do want to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.620 
easily go into and while I do want to
have<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.340> lot<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.580> adhesive<00:02:34.060> on<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.270> back<00:02:34.390> to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
have a lot of adhesive on the back to

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.990 
have a lot of adhesive on the back to
get<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> good<00:02:34.990> firm<00:02:35.230> hold<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:36.250> still<00:02:36.550> trying<00:02:36.910> to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
get a good firm hold I'm still trying to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.750 
get a good firm hold I'm still trying to
not<00:02:37.240> overdo<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.870> too<00:02:38.380> much<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.950> also<00:02:39.700> is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
not overdo it too much and also is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.430 
not overdo it too much and also is
trying<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.090> stay<00:02:40.270> away<00:02:40.420> from<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.750> corners<00:02:41.230> I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
trying to stay away from the corners I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.230 
trying to stay away from the corners I
don't<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.130> any<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.550> spill<00:02:42.820> through<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
don't want any to spill through the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.440 
don't want any to spill through the
front<00:02:43.740> after<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:45.340> step<00:02:45.580> we<00:02:45.850> let<00:02:46.240> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
front after this step we let the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.810 
front after this step we let the
adhesive<00:02:46.690> set<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.380> again<00:02:47.890> for<00:02:48.160> another<00:02:48.310> 24

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
adhesive set up again for another 24

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.680 
adhesive set up again for another 24
hours<00:02:49.560> once<00:02:50.560> our<00:02:50.770> adhesive<00:02:51.070> had<00:02:51.459> cured<00:02:51.820> it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
hours once our adhesive had cured it

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.090 
hours once our adhesive had cured it
looks<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.080> our<00:02:53.200> letters<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.680> there<00:02:53.890> pretty

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
looks like our letters on there pretty

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.310 
looks like our letters on there pretty
good<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.610> like<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.420> try<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.780> give<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.080> shake

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
good I like to try and give it a shake

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.760 
good I like to try and give it a shake
also<00:02:56.860> try<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.130> pry<00:02:57.640> them<00:02:57.760> off<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:59.260> also<00:02:59.590> want

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
also try and pry them off you also want

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.160 
also try and pry them off you also want
to<00:02:59.800> test<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.400> material<00:03:00.910> bend<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.660> little<00:03:01.990> bit

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
to test the material bend a little bit

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.690 
to test the material bend a little bit
make<00:03:02.410> sure<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.770> it's<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.040> there<00:03:03.280> even<00:03:03.400> with

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
make sure that it's on there even with

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.780 
make sure that it's on there even with
some<00:03:04.150> flexing<00:03:04.660> going<00:03:04.990> on<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:06.280> are<00:03:06.490> other

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
some flexing going on there are other

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.870 
some flexing going on there are other
ways<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.420> install<00:03:07.810> these<00:03:08.380> letters<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:09.580> just

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
ways to install these letters this just

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.520 
ways to install these letters this just
happens<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.270> be<00:03:10.450> one<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.900> like<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.200> I

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
happens to be one that I like that I

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.620 
happens to be one that I like that I
think<00:03:11.680> gives<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.130> nice<00:03:12.340> clean<00:03:12.640> look<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.209> a

think gives a nice clean look with a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.410 
think gives a nice clean look with a
minimal<00:03:14.110> effort<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.880> hope<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.150> what<00:03:16.300> you
