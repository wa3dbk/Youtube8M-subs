00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.689
 claws and musculoskeletal system 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.369
 dogs there is the most direct connection 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.380
 therefore, short claws are required 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.969

 joints and ligaments in an ideal standing position 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
