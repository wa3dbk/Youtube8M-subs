00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.510> that<00:00:00.719> Antonio<00:00:00.960> against<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.650> good<00:00:01.800> team

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I think that Antonio against a good team

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.550 
I think that Antonio against a good team
before<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.460> game<00:00:02.490> with<00:00:02.790> Ponder's<00:00:03.389> as<00:00:04.200> best<00:00:04.470> we

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
before the game with Ponder's as best we

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.380 
before the game with Ponder's as best we
could<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.009> think<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.310> transactions<00:00:06.060> were<00:00:06.150> very

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
could to think of transactions were very

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.990 
could to think of transactions were very
very<00:00:06.629> good<00:00:06.890> they<00:00:07.890> build<00:00:08.099> up<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.519> game<00:00:08.790> and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
very good they build up to this game and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.879 
very good they build up to this game and
to<00:00:11.509> tears<00:00:12.509> near<00:00:12.809> as<00:00:12.960> possible<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.740> way

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
to tears near as possible to the way

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.939 
to tears near as possible to the way
their<00:00:14.190> they<00:00:14.309> play<00:00:15.139> but<00:00:16.139> they<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.379> mesmerize

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
their they play but they do mesmerize

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.220 
their they play but they do mesmerize
you<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> passing<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.480> never<00:00:18.900> really

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
you with the passing and we never really

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.029 
you with the passing and we never really
controlled<00:00:20.010> messy<00:00:21.350> but<00:00:22.350> many<00:00:22.619> people<00:00:22.859> have

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
controlled messy but many people have

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.400 
controlled messy but many people have
said<00:00:23.250> out<00:00:23.430> anyway<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:26.750> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:27.990> when<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.140> got

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
said out anyway and I think when we got

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.400 
said out anyway and I think when we got
the<00:00:28.529> lifeline<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> Wayne<00:00:29.550> Rooney<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.410> expected

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the lifeline of Wayne Rooney I expected

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
the lifeline of Wayne Rooney I expected
to<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.679> better<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.070> second<00:00:32.460> half<00:00:32.540> well<00:00:33.540> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
to do better in the second half well I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389 
to do better in the second half well I
think<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.989> great<00:00:34.350> teams<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.130> cycles

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
think that great teams do go in cycles

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.260 
think that great teams do go in cycles
and<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:38.070> sake<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.309> their<00:00:38.610> own<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> moment

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and the sake of their own in the moment

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.840 
and the sake of their own in the moment
is<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:40.200> best<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.980> Europe<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.340> no<00:00:41.460> question

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is the best and Europe is no question

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.450 
is the best and Europe is no question
with<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.440> they<00:00:43.440> came<00:00:43.649> down<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> choice

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
with that they came down to a choice

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
with that they came down to a choice
between<00:00:44.940> maker<00:00:45.329> Owen<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> Dimitar<00:00:46.500> Berbatov

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
between maker Owen and Dimitar Berbatov

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.590 
between maker Owen and Dimitar Berbatov
and<00:00:47.450> my<00:00:48.450> view<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.190> if<00:00:50.480> you're<00:00:51.480> looking

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and my view is that if you're looking

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.369 
and my view is that if you're looking
for<00:00:51.899> someone<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:53.660> Nick<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> goal<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> last

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
for someone to Nick a goal in the last

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.080 
for someone to Nick a goal in the last
few<00:00:55.559> minutes<00:00:55.680> per<00:00:55.920> game<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.489> Owens

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
few minutes per game with Owens

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.790 
few minutes per game with Owens
experience<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.100> think<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.280> why<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> took<00:00:59.609> him

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
experience I think that's why I took him

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.200 
experience I think that's why I took him
it's<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.920> great<00:01:02.100> moment<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.609> them<00:01:02.730> they

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it's a great moment for them they

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.960 
it's a great moment for them they
deserve<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.199> way<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> right<00:01:04.589> way

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
deserve it because if way the right way

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.830 
deserve it because if way the right way
and<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.240> enjoy<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> football<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:08.659> stole<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and they enjoy the football I stole and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
and they enjoy the football I stole and
is<00:01:10.170> no<00:01:10.320> any<00:01:10.530> consolation<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.369> you're<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
is no any consolation to see you're the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
is no any consolation to see you're the
second-best<00:01:12.060> team<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:13.080> enjoy

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
second-best team because we don't enjoy

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.999 
second-best team because we don't enjoy
being<00:01:13.470> second-best<00:01:14.570> now<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.170> any<00:01:16.680> team

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
being second-best now I think any team

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
being second-best now I think any team
with<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.280> history<00:01:17.479> any<00:01:18.479> club<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.930> has

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
with your history any club that has

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.550 
with your history any club that has
should<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.790> Real<00:01:21.360> Madrid's<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.110> AC

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
should we have our Real Madrid's or AC

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.940 
should we have our Real Madrid's or AC
