00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
no I like we're at from a conditioning

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.040 
no I like we're at from a conditioning
standpoint<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:48.840> much<00:00:49.020> better

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
of practice itself and then the tempo

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
of practice itself and then the tempo

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
which we operate offensively and that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.139 
which we operate offensively and that
affects<00:01:00.629> both<00:01:00.809> sides<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> ball<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.149> I've

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
