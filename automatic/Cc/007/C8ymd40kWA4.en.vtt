00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:13.769
 the very chairman of that sitting 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.340
 solemn our leader 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.580
 Andrew Moorish deputy Andrew Moor 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.930
 ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen , 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.539
 other members of this table to the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.750
 solemn session in honor of the day 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 of the appreciation of the family that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.730
 was celebrated on October 21 that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 today at the request of our leader and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.629
 federal deputy andré moura having as 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.170
 couto 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.980
 the co authors the dear deputy joão 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.000
 Our beloved 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.399
 arolde de oliveira 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.239
 this session has an important 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.320
 because we consider the family to be 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 as a basic organization of society 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 so the family is one of the main 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 one of the main banners that ps 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.270
 has as a slogan the first human being 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.640
 place our Christian struggle in politics has 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.939
 in the sense of recovering the values 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 the family as a contribution to the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.080
 building a better brazil 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.320
 in addition to the effort to reduce 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.140
 violence in improving education and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.829
 distribution of opportunity for all 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.310
 as our constitution advocates that 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.299
 says without prejudice of origin race sex 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.680
 color and any other forms of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.640
 discrimination 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.799
 we believe in this way since the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.829
 the beginnings of human history 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.950
 we know that the family is the cell 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.770
 mater of society 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.399
 we find in the genes the record that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.350
 peoples before 9 years of age 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.750
 family created by god 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.030
 Adam and Eve 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.480
 after that time God preserved the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.050
 family for the continuity of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.300
 new generations in the period may be 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.030
 numerous accounts of civilizations that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.030
 emerged in Mesopotamia in Egypt in the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.520
 india in greece in china some countries 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.490
 of Europe as well as civilizations in the new 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.970
 world as the kingdom of the Aztec Incas of the 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.160
 more and others in ancient Mesopotamia 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.680
 we have a record of a man named 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.950
 Abraham who received a divine command 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.110
 to exit towards a land that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.519
 today is where the state of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.820
 Israel and to embrace it and its 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.110
 family would be blessed all 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.019
 earth families 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.870
 so in man's history there are many 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.890
 reports of people who formed their 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 families 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.110
 have moved to other places and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.840
 in the saga of their actions we bequeath 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.570
 miscellaneous information on the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.820
 walk and the epic of thousands upon thousands 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.459
 of families on the face of the earth 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.280
 Brazil, for example, comes from families 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.130
 Portuguese who arrived here 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.269
 already in the period of captaincy discoveries 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.250
 heritable 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.459
 adding its indigenous groups that already 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.890
 there were many preserved to this day 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.799
 Brazil subsequently received other 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.530
 contributions from Africa and 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.239
 contingency of wars and conflicts 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.160
 families coming from southeastern europe 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.709
 Asian in other places 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.920
 all these families contributed 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.440
 significantly for the formation of the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.970
 Brazilian state the federative republic 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.239
 of Brazil 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.950
 ladies and gentlemen and jumped over here 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.930
 the family in the broad sense 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.060
 but I also want to highlight the family in the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.140
 strict sense 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.609
 for god said so shall the man leave 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.880
 father mother and be joined to his wife making 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.630
 if the two only one installs in the 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.359
 genes 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.099
 we find in chapter 24 the 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.370
 divine record is quite clear 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.709
 leaves the man the father and the mother 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.079
 joins his wife joining her 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.060
 woman gives birth to children 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.760
 continuity to generations 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.729
 it is in the family that the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.810
 ethical and moral values for 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.320
 the society 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.229
 in the Greek ethics it is of waist 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.710
 sets the agenda for actions throughout 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.590
 any terrain wherever it is 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.500
 human being comes to act or is the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.530
 parents of the children of the family in general 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.990
 morality of the moral 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.020
 uses and customs teaches everything 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 what about honest virtuoso 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.419
 accordance with the principles of 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.970
 coexistence in human relations 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.180
 it is in the family that we form the child of 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.539
 today the young and tomorrow the man of the future 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.720
 so we found a record of the 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.880
 wise King Solomon who says that the 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.550
 child in the way she should walk and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.650
 even when you grow old you will not forget 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.440
 he will not depart from it in proverbs 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.500
 22 6 in the family 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.310
 find the child or teach the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.990
 child respect for discipline 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.870
 responsibility to overcome facts of the 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.169
 day-to-day cooperation between beings 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.020
 human beings and human beings if we 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.460
 ethical and moral values . 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.810
 reminding them that they are contained in 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.960
 Christian values 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.960
 tomorrow we will have a healthy young one 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.000
 balanced human rights to the vote of 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.750
 Brazilians through their 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.789
 representatives at the national congress 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.550
 decided that the state will protect the family 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:02.150
 with the guarantee contained in the 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.169
 federal constitution in article 226 that 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.539
 say 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.030
 for the protection of the state is 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.580
 recognized the stable union between 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.389
 man and woman as a family entity 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.410
 The law should facilitate their conversion into 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.020
 marriage 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.840
 so the ps is fighting for the 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.970
 valuing the family and the human being 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.490
 in the first place to the time when 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.780
 contribute to strengthening the family 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.750
 Brazilian 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.270
 not only in basic education but also in 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.590
 also through the ethical and 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.580
 moral 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.620
 as highlighted by the leader of the psc 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.280
 I'm going to take a phrase here, it 's me and he 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.260
 says the family is also a national good 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.290
 be protected by current legislators 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.240
 for future Brazilian generations 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.970
 so it's up to the national congress 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.600
 show your core protector bias 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.100
 family as well as awareness of 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.370
 representatives who work here and who 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:05.510
 were elected by his people on the day 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.660
 October 21 this represents only one 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:12.710
 day a small fraction of the shares of this 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.660
 house in support of the basic unit of 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.260
 Brazilian society 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:22.100
 the family is finally ladies and gentlemen 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:24.290

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.950

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.090
 the end ladies and gentlemen I believe that the 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.490

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:43.340
 democratic society that will be a 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.830
 for other nations
