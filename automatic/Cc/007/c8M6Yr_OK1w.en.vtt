00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.410 
pure sustenance I eat plate foods
primarily<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.700> wouldn't<00:00:51.059> kill<00:00:51.300> an

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
primarily because I wouldn't kill an

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.950 
primarily because I wouldn't kill an
animal<00:00:51.649> my<00:00:52.649> own<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.149> whether<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.539> know

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
animal my own you know whether you know

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
animal my own you know whether you know
the<00:00:55.320> guts<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:55.710> whatever<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> call<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the guts or whatever you want to call it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
the guts or whatever you want to call it
I<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:57.000> don't<00:00:57.239> think<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
I just don't think it's right so I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
I just don't think it's right so I
wouldn't<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.910> personally

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
wouldn't do it personally

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.630 
wouldn't do it personally
so<00:01:00.329> there's<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.530> also<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.340> fact<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
so there's that but also the fact that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.009 
so there's that but also the fact that
I've<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.090> feeling<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.420> much<00:01:03.510> better<00:01:03.780> not

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I've just feeling so much better not

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.140 
I've just feeling so much better not
eating<00:01:04.379> those<00:01:04.530> foods<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
eating those foods so for me it's a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.850 
eating those foods so for me it's a
win-win<00:01:06.540> again<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> could<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> want

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
win-win again you could do what you want

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.630 
win-win again you could do what you want
but<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.570> me<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> win-win<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.590> find<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
but for me it's a win-win so I find that

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
but for me it's a win-win so I find that
when<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> eat<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.270> simpler<00:01:12.810> foods<00:01:13.110> when<00:01:13.350> I

when I eat these simpler foods when I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.469 
when I eat these simpler foods when I
eat<00:01:13.560> these<00:01:13.710> foods<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.369> high<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.150> water

call it but I guess that isn't at the
point<00:02:27.689> of<00:02:28.110> food<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.819> propel<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.900> the
