00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.030 
well on any bike you put them on and it
has<00:02:31.030> made<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.269> big<00:02:31.510> difference<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.170> bike

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.860 

the<00:02:36.040> things<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.519> really<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.209> about<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.660> D<00:02:37.840> I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
the things I really like about the D I

the things I really like about the D I
said<00:02:38.230> 400<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:39.030> rock-solid<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:41.080> thing<00:02:41.349> doesn't

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
said 400 a rock-solid this thing doesn't

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.259 
said 400 a rock-solid this thing doesn't
need<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.099> servicing<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.700> some<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.150> those

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
need the servicing that some of those

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.930 
need the servicing that some of those
high-end<00:02:43.569> enduro<00:02:44.110> bikes<00:02:44.500> needs<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.670> very

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
high-end enduro bikes needs so it's very

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180 
high-end enduro bikes needs so it's very
easy<00:02:46.120> change<00:02:46.690> oil<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.319> it'll<00:02:47.590> last<00:02:47.739> forever

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
easy change oil and it'll last forever

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.430 
easy change oil and it'll last forever
in<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.580> day<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.269> Pistons<00:02:49.720> not<00:02:49.930> gonna<00:02:50.109> wear<00:02:50.290> and

in a day the Pistons not gonna wear and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.960 
in a day the Pistons not gonna wear and
the<00:02:50.530> piston<00:02:51.010> rings<00:02:51.250> aren't<00:02:51.459> gonna<00:02:51.579> wear<00:02:51.820> as

the piston rings aren't gonna wear as

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.599 
the piston rings aren't gonna wear as
quick<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:52.540> that's<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.109> plus<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.380> my<00:02:53.620> book<00:02:53.769> the

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
quick so that's a plus in my book the

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.520 
quick so that's a plus in my book the
seats<00:02:54.910> real<00:02:55.209> comfortable<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.049> ergonomics

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
seats real comfortable the ergonomics

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.590 
seats real comfortable the ergonomics
for<00:02:56.590> somebody<00:02:57.010> my<00:02:57.280> size<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.820> very<00:02:58.120> comfortable

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
for somebody my size is very comfortable

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.630 
for somebody my size is very comfortable
to<00:02:58.900> be<00:02:59.109> able<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.350> just<00:02:59.560> sit<00:02:59.709> down<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.310> plot

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
to be able to just sit down and plot

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.520 
to be able to just sit down and plot
along<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.420> really<00:03:01.690> good<00:03:01.840> bike<00:03:02.109> for<00:03:02.380> that

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
along it's a really good bike for that

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.259 
along it's a really good bike for that
what's<00:03:03.310> some<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.579> the<00:03:03.700> things<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.209> think

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
what's some of the things that I think

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.630 
what's some of the things that I think
will<00:03:04.630> improve<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.170> bike<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.650> my<00:03:05.829> eyes<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
will improve this bike in my eyes is it

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.490 
will improve this bike in my eyes is it
doesn't<00:03:06.819> have<00:03:07.120> hand<00:03:07.420> guys<00:03:07.660> it's<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.260> little

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
doesn't have hand guys it's a little

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.990 
doesn't have hand guys it's a little
thing<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:08.920> does<00:03:09.069> mean<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> lot<00:03:09.489> when<00:03:09.880> you're

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
thing but it does mean a lot when you're

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.370 
thing but it does mean a lot when you're
riding<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.480> bush<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.930> know<00:03:10.959> trees

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
hitting your hands and also riding on

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.000 
hitting your hands and also riding on
the<00:03:13.480> roads<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.959> file<00:03:14.200> trail<00:03:14.530> roads<00:03:14.799> once

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
the roads and the file trail roads once

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.770 
the roads and the file trail roads once
it<00:03:15.130> gets<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.370> bit<00:03:15.519> cold<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.030> wind<00:03:16.269> deflection

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
it gets a bit cold that wind deflection

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.569 
it gets a bit cold that wind deflection
does<00:03:16.989> keep<00:03:17.290> your<00:03:17.440> hands<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.769> little<00:03:17.889> bit<00:03:18.100> warmer
