00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.400 
started noticing that it would get
thicker<00:04:03.470> than<00:04:04.470> normal<00:04:04.500> around<00:04:05.780> six<00:04:06.780> weeks<00:04:07.080> I

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.460 
oil that I know it's promotes growth and
all<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:38.910> do<00:04:38.970> want<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.390> say<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.900> get<00:04:40.440> a

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
all of that and I do want to say I get a

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.240 
all of that and I do want to say I get a
lot<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.740> questions<00:04:41.160> about<00:04:41.310> oils<00:04:41.850> anyway<00:04:42.330> and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
lot of questions about oils anyway and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.010 
lot of questions about oils anyway and
they<00:04:44.250> asked<00:04:44.610> me<00:04:44.790> where<00:04:45.150> can<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.480> get<00:04:45.660> them<00:04:45.840> and

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
they asked me where can you get them and

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.490 
they asked me where can you get them and
what<00:04:46.320> type<00:04:46.620> or<00:04:46.980> whatever<00:04:47.490> whatever<00:04:47.780> all<00:04:48.780> that

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
what type or whatever whatever all that

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.130 
what type or whatever whatever all that
you<00:04:49.650> should<00:04:49.680> get<00:04:50.130> should<00:04:50.520> be<00:04:50.700> 100%<00:04:51.630> natural

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
you should get should be 100% natural

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.890 
you should get should be 100% natural
and<00:04:52.350> unrefined<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.240> means<00:04:54.540> they<00:04:54.690> need<00:04:54.840> to

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
and unrefined so that means they need to

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.710 
and unrefined so that means they need to
be<00:04:55.020> all<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.890> way<00:04:56.340> natural<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.510> oil

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
be all the way natural of that oil

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.469 
be all the way natural of that oil
instead<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.470> with<00:04:58.800> additives<00:04:59.370> in<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.790> normally

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
instead of with additives in it normally

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.610 
instead of with additives in it normally
when<00:05:01.050> uh<00:05:01.640> when<00:05:02.640> up<00:05:03.180> oil<00:05:03.690> comes<00:05:04.320> in<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.590> jar

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
when uh when up oil comes in a jar

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.860 
when uh when up oil comes in a jar
that's<00:05:05.340> made<00:05:05.640> by<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.910> brand<00:05:06.330> that<00:05:06.540> says

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
that's made by a brand that says

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.140 
that's made by a brand that says
whatever<00:05:07.530> whatever<00:05:07.919> whatever<00:05:08.250> on<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.790> and

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
whatever whatever whatever on it and

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.750 
whatever whatever whatever on it and
then<00:05:09.630> castor<00:05:10.140> oil<00:05:10.169> maybe<00:05:10.590> by<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.890> line<00:05:11.370> it

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
then castor oil maybe by a line it

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.600 
then castor oil maybe by a line it
normally<00:05:12.540> is<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.990> most<00:05:13.200> refined<00:05:13.380> of<00:05:14.040> that

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
normally is it the most refined of that

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.480 
normally is it the most refined of that
oil<00:05:14.850> so<00:05:15.390> if<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:16.080> can<00:05:16.290> get<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.740> all<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:17.340> are<00:05:17.460> in

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
oil so if you can get to all that are in

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.690 
oil so if you can get to all that are in
the<00:05:17.790> bottles<00:05:18.240> like<00:05:18.510> this<00:05:18.810> that's<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:22.700> 100

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
the bottles like this that's a 100

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.270 
the bottles like this that's a 100
percent<00:05:24.180> pure<00:05:24.690> on<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.410> then<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.740> know<00:05:26.040> that

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
percent pure on it then you know that

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.360 
percent pure on it then you know that
this<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.760> some<00:05:27.000> real<00:05:27.300> oils<00:05:28.140> or<00:05:28.410> is<00:05:28.979> it<00:05:29.160> it's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
this is some real oils or is it it's

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.790 
this is some real oils or is it it's
real<00:05:29.760> cash<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.330> oil<00:05:30.510> and<00:05:30.780> when<00:05:31.260> you<00:05:31.350> look<00:05:31.590> on

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
real cash to oil and when you look on

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.670 
real cash to oil and when you look on
the<00:05:31.919> ingredients<00:05:32.130> on<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.060> back<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:34.500> will

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
the ingredients on the back it will

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.409 
the ingredients on the back it will
probably<00:05:35.070> just<00:05:35.220> say<00:05:35.400> castor<00:05:35.970> oil<00:05:36.000> they

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
probably just say castor oil they

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.140 
probably just say castor oil they
shouldn't<00:05:36.780> say<00:05:36.990> any<00:05:37.800> other<00:05:38.310> thing<00:05:38.700> that's<00:05:38.910> in

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
shouldn't say any other thing that's in

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.320 
shouldn't say any other thing that's in
there<00:05:39.860> say<00:05:40.860> it<00:05:41.100> says<00:05:41.250> 100%<00:05:41.880> pure<00:05:42.690> guaranteed

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
there say it says 100% pure guaranteed

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.409 
there say it says 100% pure guaranteed
so<00:05:46.280> this<00:05:47.280> is<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.580> castor<00:05:48.030> oil<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.360> I

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419
