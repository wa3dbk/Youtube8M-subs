00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.270
 it is 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.210
 Well, I have a price target for the end of 2012 called that does not mean that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.829
 the then percent this message from the analyst since it already assumed that 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:23.640
 we 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.069
 around 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.689
 ultimately in the next ten years 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.550
 In the next ten years I will look like that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.280
 which today does not want to fix me there for one year 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.070
 I just want to give some advice to the listeners they do not 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.310
 of course I use a phase galloping devaluation of course and 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.030
 then too 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.690
 Houses share other assets to buy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.390
 and I will also do so after a currency reform so I look forward to it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.970
 not to take that in my mouth 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.280
 The question is 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.490
 not today if we all came our form just when they will come 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.400
 and he could help us 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.500
 argue that this will be in two waves four years if it is not this year 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.299
 but happen 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.380
 20 years will happen 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.540
 Even after such a guys reform, I'll be ready too 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.260
 next to it percent 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.830
 To buy real assets but then just so a new currency Wansleben one 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.190
 hall and other currency reform 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.659
 It always pulls the new youngsters are kept short because 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.860
 it is important that this new currency gave the victory is that constantly 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.200
 the more confidence you make, yes, yes 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.679
 And you can keep this new one like Hungary in such a phase 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.879
 It is very important to think about the man too much 

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.330
 Bought gold and silver 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.240
 what am I doing 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.790
 because then in the next five to ten years the lights will continue to go on 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.750
 but I always say I will be a third of what I am physical today 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.150
 Own gold and silver 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.670
 In the next ten years, these should not be relocated to 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.160
 Assets or in a new currency 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.760
 if this triple that I am now 37 years old I would like to keep that as 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.570
 Pension provision female 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.840
 I am very confident about silver because of its real economy 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.900
 Meaning and the low range compared to each other Mittal 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.180
 in the next thirty forty years a very very and here would be plant 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.800
 will remain independent of the development of a paper system one 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.100
 new paper currency or any other kind of flight 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.979
 Protect property 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.259
 nine money completely independent of it 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:28.899
 and that's why I'm around the guy should you get that one-fourth as a percentage 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.129
 practically like that 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.589
 around 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:35.679
 so that had ways of saving the money just do not look at the 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:36.189
 To give hands
