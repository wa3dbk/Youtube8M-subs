00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 the staff here is going to be a series of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.000
 videos where we get caught in the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.670
 old office of the time and transforming 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.940
 he in a modern computer paint him 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.390
 make some modifications to make a hair 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.880
 normal system a motherboard until I did 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.480
 and then we will be installing the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.060
 same system of the time I wanted is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 doing this project for a long time and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 I saw in the well 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.129
 the cabinet for 15 pounds giving a 50 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.829
 real and was a very good price cabinet 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.010
 beautiful it has a damage below the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 people will fix it and it will also scratched 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.480
 We 'll just be painting then. 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 It's not a problem 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 the stuff we're going to be using 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.320
 it's not an ink even a good deal 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.579
 interesting thing that is used in cars and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.699
 cabinets 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.460
 it is a plastic layer that is well 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.739
 cool you click it with spray and then 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.040
 You can take it if you do not like it or 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.200
 if you go change then let's go 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.950
 The first part for me was to try 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.170
 repair damage on the base of the cabinet 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.840
 What was much harder than me? 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.270
 I thought it was going to be I do not give a damn 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 idea of â€‹â€‹what happened he must have 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 fallen several times to reach this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.060
 state because it is a metal part and is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 well tough, but hard and but I 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.509
 I managed to leave her in the place she already gave 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.450
 an improved 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.500
 I ended up having to disconnect the part 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.570
 and is a strange medium mechanism. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.170
 snatch half screw 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.350
 Only then I disconnected him and hit him. 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.659
 back and he was right straight did not stay 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.439
 perfect but it will stay like that anyway 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.020
 has peta calm and this is the side that 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.579
 will have leaned against the wall then it's good 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.579
 as well as the next step 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.610
 I used the newspaper to think from 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.140
 inside the plastic is not dripping 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.420
 inside because I do not want to have 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.730
 tempted in there I could not think not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.080
 I'm going to have that decent price and I'm not 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.670
 there is need 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.980
 so I simply the newspaper and the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.410
 exits from the front panel I'll get 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.430
 a small piece of newspaper and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.170
 simply trust him and the button I 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.299
 I'll use a piece of tape to be recruited. 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.370
 in the right circle 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.010
 only this kind of thing you have to 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.980
 should be taken within two hours because 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.530
 you let them paint dry after 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.620
 When are you going to take this thing out of this? 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.720
 type of thing it's gonna be, it's all pulling 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.170
 as if it were a piece of rubber 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.200
 You'll understand, I tried to cover the logo. 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.780
 the apple on both sides but I ended up 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.780
 giving up was a bit complicated as 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.060
 it is also scratched, it was not scratched 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.630
 best idea and I ended up taking 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.630
 giving up 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.190
 then the time to use spray is the same 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:18.370
 recommendations in ventilated place and 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.250
 magistrate before the cream of your hand 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.889
 then come back and give yourself a second 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.280
 scheme and you will see that the product 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.280
 cool 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.490
 It turned out to be dark and I forgot to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.560
 change camera options 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.440
 So where was not very good but I 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.310
 I'm afraid to paint the day 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.300
 Following 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.300
 so come on 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.640
 and how can you see the product 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.630
 end was almost perfect almost 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.600
 finished 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:58.650
 It lacked just a little bit more 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.450
 hand had just spray and tv in places 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.110
 where this barreto also became a 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.490
 filth 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.680
 Only I'm glad it's cool 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.480
 I'm going to buy another can and go 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:16.590
 I'm finished with work but I'm going 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.440
 decide completely and that's it from you 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.790
 want to continue seeing this series there 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.070
 sign up for the channel 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:27.410
 Do not forget to leave that one there. 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.410
 underneath and there I went
