00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.759
 hello how about friends how are I going here 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.289
 well I hope you are of the best good as 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.000
 it's my first video I hope not me 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.480
 criticize a lot because I did what I could 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.250
 so that the video is good and you like it 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.050
 good in this video I decided to do it over 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.540
 curiosities and stories about 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.250
 videogames so I hope you like the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.760
 first curiosity is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.980
 portal 2 the curiosity is about a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 strange noise that analyzing it forms a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.900
 image is in a room the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.210
 room is the samper test 7 a 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.280
 room before one picks up like a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 radio that repeats a song all the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.989
 time they seem to be all over the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.030
 game but when you take it as a 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.790
 secret place inside the test chamber 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.950
 start making some noise if it is not 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 something very strange but when recording these 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.410
 noises or sounds and then analyze them it 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.330
 see that it is a s stv or a signal 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.399
 encoded in sound that after several 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.040
 filters can become an image 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.810
 the image shows the opening logo on 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 laboratori is I the truth I do not have 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.590
 a lot of information about why it is that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 out such thing is just a simple 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.660
 curiosity or it will be nothing more an achievement for 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.210
 what I have seen on the internet portal 2 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.070
 it has more curious things but I just put 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.740
 one so as not to waste a lot of time and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.539
 follow me the truth I have not played this 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.490
 game so I do not know much just 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.080
 I found this simple curiosity about 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.080
 internet that caught my attention 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.010
 now I will talk about a topic that I called the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.840
 secret ghost of hitman with drugs 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.610
 good as some will know hitman will 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.190
 it's about a game about you're a 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.350
 killer rather said the best killer 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.450
 that this murderer can exist 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.410
 call for your bar code behind your 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.540
 head like 47 what agent 47 good for 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.150
 Do not tire them with the story in it 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.100
 with tracks in mission 71 you find 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.050
 a force that seems to be closed 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.030
 when one approaches they speak to him as 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.060
 telling you to get back where 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.890
 you came but that mysterious door can 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.810
 one enter while nobody is 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.820
 observing and enters in place that only 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.030
 some of those who have played this game 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.860
 they know her one goes through a corridor in 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.110
 where a ghost appears where 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.600
 you have to get there quickly because if not 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.910
 you see at the end there is a room in 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.860
 where a murder occurred in the neighborhood 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.900
 that room to look in the mirror 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.330
 can see behind the ghost what is 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.700
 something strange and curious is that you can 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.950
 kill the ghost or you're killing 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.230
 a dead man that sounds somewhat ridiculous 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.400
 maybe it's like a metaphor to win 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.110
 your fears 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.939
 in the hallway you can kill him 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.030
 even drag your body or better 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.920
 said his soul the truth is strange to me 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.980
 that such a ghost comes out and can be 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.659
 kill I do not know what you think there 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.659
 they can draw their conclusions 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.479
 now I will talk about a game that is very 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.000
 old the truth this mystery or 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.650
 curiosity is something clichÃ© since many 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.990
 they have talked about this but I want 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.909
 try to enter more like giving them more 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.800
 information that everyone says as 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.409
 for example the death that caused this 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.360
 game called polybius good in case 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.720
 some do not know polybius was a 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.900
 arcade video game released during the year 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.539
 1981 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.000
 this said game caused problems to the 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.280
 players were sometimes devastating 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.919
 some got sick playing this 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.650
 game had some effects like madness 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.780
 stress memory loss nightmares 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.780
 and even something more serious that is the 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.699
 suicide they say that this game came out 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.620
 suddenly and they placed them in 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.930
 several playrooms in the suburbs 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.909
 from Portland the game was apparently 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.949
 manufactured by a company called sing 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.229
 exist in German loss of 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.199
 senses and programmed by the rock berg 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.090
 Soon the game became very 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.960
 popular until you reach the point of 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.920
 produce addiction in some players 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.380
 interestingly the game at the beginning 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.200
 it caused a great addiction for later 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.940
 generate an audio mister at the same the 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.680
 players claimed to see faces 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.930
 ghostly out of the corner of your eye 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.450
 running the game screen to a 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.340
 almost imperceptible speed this game 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.740
 it caused a player a death for 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.840
 cause of an epilepsy I imagine that at 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.820
 receive so much light is different color 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.250
 with a distorted pattern with some 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.440
 very strange sounds and messages 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.720
 subliminals that the eyes could not almost 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.210
 grasp but your mind still processes them 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.010
 caused him death since that kind of 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.930
 things can make you lose control 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.640
 of your body in can even make you 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.470
 stop working your neurons and 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.440
 organs and you can and even stop 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.900
 breathe and finish dead good 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.970
 finally the local press for by lan 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.190
 echoed the death of a player 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.830
 who suffered an epileptic seizure while 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.840
 played and the next day the employees 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.120
 from that company came dresses from 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.040
 black disappeared all the games of 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.780
 polybius with the same speed in which 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.630
 they placed the game 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.670
 now I will analyze a little if they fix the 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.680
 figure that is in the middle is like a 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.990
 star to the prince I thought it was the 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.330
 famous davis star that star is 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.160
 a six-pointed star the star 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.230
 David is supposed to be satanic 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.660
 because it has the form of a hexagram that 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.460
 a hexagram is a satanic symbol but 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.770
 the difference between that branch and the 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.480
 star of davis is that he hexagram 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.669
 is surrounded by a circle 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.470
 so by my idea if you fix this 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.690
 star that comes out in the game is 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.760
 surrounded by a kind of circle by 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.980
 what could be a hexagram maybe 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.310
 for the same reason is that this game is 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.470
 considered a good satanic game 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.330
 in conclusion this game is very bad already 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.460
 that I tried it a bit and with only 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.500
 start it I felt headache and 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.540
 I could not play it anymore and the truth is that 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.100
 those lights and sounds that this produces 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.100
 game are annoying 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:36.019
 Well I hope you liked the video 

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:37.699
 I did not put many curiosities since the 

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:39.649
 Paul's story and views made me more 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.499
 long what I thought I hope you like it 

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:44.389
 hopefully comment and subscribe for sure 

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:46.309
 I'll make another video like this so 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:49.329
 wait for it and good with this I finish 

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:49.329
 until next time
