saying and there was a problem

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.759 
saying and there was a problem
installing<00:00:23.160> Mac<00:00:23.699> OS<00:00:24.029> X<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.109> was<00:00:25.230> asking<00:00:25.619> me

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
installing Mac OS X and it was asking me

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.880 
installing Mac OS X and it was asking me
to<00:00:26.240> reinstall<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:28.260> OS<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.080> thought<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
