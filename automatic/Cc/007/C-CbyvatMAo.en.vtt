00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.389 
there and there's a lot of great tires
out<00:00:59.699> there<00:00:59.969> by<00:01:00.059> Continental<00:01:00.750> Michelin<00:01:01.710> just

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
out there by Continental Michelin just

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.390 
out there by Continental Michelin just
to<00:01:02.489> name<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> few<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.570> definitely<00:01:04.400> have

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to name a few but these definitely have

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.859 
to name a few but these definitely have
always<00:01:05.670> seemed<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> class<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.810> their

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
always seemed to be in a class of their

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.030 
always seemed to be in a class of their
own<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.130> major<00:01:08.369> reason<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.150> that

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
own and I think the major reason is that

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
own and I think the major reason is that
other<00:01:11.040> hand<00:01:11.369> made<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.850> well<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> biggest

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
other hand made as well but the biggest

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.980 
other hand made as well but the biggest
thing<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.950> cotton<00:01:14.760> casing<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.780> high

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
thing is the cotton casing and the high

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.440 
thing is the cotton casing and the high
threads<00:01:16.439> per<00:01:16.530> inch<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.850> makes<00:01:18.210> his

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
