we<00:00:25.199> really<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> make<00:00:25.890> sure<00:00:25.919> that<00:00:26.220> there's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
we really want to make sure that there's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.609 
we really want to make sure that there's
that<00:00:26.579> contrast<00:00:27.090> between<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.930> negative<00:00:28.320> space

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
that contrast between the negative space

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.420 
that contrast between the negative space
and<00:00:29.480> then<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.689> high-tension<00:00:31.169> Speights<00:00:31.680> you

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and then the high-tension Speights you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.369 
and then the high-tension Speights you
need<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.000> exploration<00:00:33.720> you<00:00:33.960> need<00:00:34.199> the

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
need the exploration you need the

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.070 
need the exploration you need the
scavenging<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.160> need<00:00:35.400> something<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.900> say

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
scavenging you need something to to say

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.619 
scavenging you need something to to say
like<00:00:37.290> okay<00:00:37.589> I'm<00:00:38.040> setting<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> certain<00:00:38.879> tone<00:00:39.089> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.140 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and
a<00:00:39.989> patina<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.000> can

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
a patina here so that then we can

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.090 
a patina here so that then we can
contrast<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.839> with<00:00:43.110> some<00:00:43.230> Stark<00:00:43.589> like

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
contrast that with some Stark like

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.549 
contrast that with some Stark like
changes<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:45.089> need<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> intensity<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.199> strike

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
changes we need the intensity to strike

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.399 
changes we need the intensity to strike
a<00:00:46.860> different<00:00:47.579> chord<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.540> only<00:00:48.690> works<00:00:49.050> if

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
a different chord it that only works if

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.439 
a different chord it that only works if
you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.100> negative<00:00:50.460> space<00:00:50.790> to<00:00:51.059> play<00:00:51.239> off

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you have the negative space to play off

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.380 
you have the negative space to play off
of<00:00:51.479> we<00:00:52.199> wanted<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:53.369> forced<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.150> make

and I can create a Molotov cocktail from

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.399 
and I can create a Molotov cocktail from
it<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.359> gonna<00:01:48.509> help<00:01:48.719> me<00:01:48.810> take<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> couple

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
it that's gonna help me take a couple

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.290 
it that's gonna help me take a couple
guys<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.740> five<00:01:50.189> users

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.790 

or<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:57.330> could<00:01:57.600> use<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> same<00:01:58.020> ingredients<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
or I could use the same ingredients and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.340 
or I could use the same ingredients and
craft<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.400> medkit<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.690> lets<00:02:00.960> me<00:02:01.050> kind<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
craft a medkit and that lets me kind of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.840
