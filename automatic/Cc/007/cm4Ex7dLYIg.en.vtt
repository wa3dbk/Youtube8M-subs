00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello from gamescom 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.839
 we are here at the booth of 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.030
 cyber called an Austrian 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.420
 do an interesting thing 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.670
 Project started at kik saada 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.529
 it is currently available until the 31st 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.510
 August not true 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.789
 what is the virtual quieter so 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.470
 Good morning first, the virtual acer 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.560
 is a locomotion device for virtual 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.510
 reality sr together with a head 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 mounted display such as the one though i did 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.320
 Can you do that not only in the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.969
 but can look around virtual environment 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.570
 really through the virtual 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.550
 run around and be safe 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.170
 free with his natural movements 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.059
 moving in the virtual environment 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.739
 So what was missing so far, so to speak 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 because you have separated the emissions 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.260
 by a 3 bet when it comes to movement 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.239
 is just as it is still something 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 not so possible because she really was 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.579
 the movement in the game for translation 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.770
 especially in the infinitely large 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.899
 virtual worlds to move on without 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 to push the boundaries of real space 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.189
 and the virtual enables exactly that and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.890
 FÃ¼rst this classic problem of 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.330
 virtual reality, the device is just too 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 support their suite or are too 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.380
 more products product support 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.259
 and thought again as for example 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.560
 previously morpheus or similar to the virgin 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.909
 open platform and is with 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.750
 various head mounted displays 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.400
 compatible 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.710
 it is not necessary for this to be one 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 open flying is what was the cost to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.030
 it comes out so currently is the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.470
 virtual on kickstarter available the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.530
 kickstarter price for the standard 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.799
 is currently $ 7 149 the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.420
 relegation namely already sold out and 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.119
 next year will be the regular one 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.670
 the market takes place with the price for it 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.799
 yet to publish is yes then 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 We wish you good luck and happy 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.890
 Try the village for yourself 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.890
 That's why they like themselves 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.410
 he uses the device for the first time and 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.580
 What's surprising in this world 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.580
 corazza everything had happened 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.290
 yes I 'm just coming to virtual travel myself 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.360
 try and yes we have seen and 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.460
 It is really a great feeling it is 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.650
 very sensitive the whole thing has to be so 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.140
 really practice that to master that 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.610
 On the other hand I was also very can therefore 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.830
 fast on the way very well 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.490
 The feeling is of course unique 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.690
 is very clear and I think so that is 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.520
 in any case the future the 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.840
 history and may be good that cyber 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.180
 then really broke the standard set 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.680
 if they continue to develop that 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.170
 the whole project continues I am 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.420
 very much looking forward to that 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.370
 skyrim any school with it later 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.900
 to be able to try out the new uk 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.340
 two versions or other glasses it 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.340
 the future is very clear
