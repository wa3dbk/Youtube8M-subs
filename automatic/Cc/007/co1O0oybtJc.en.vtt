00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
you may notice that my face looks more

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
you may notice that my face looks more
tan<00:00:29.880> than<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.179> body<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.750> that's<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.289> I've

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
tan than my body and that's because I've

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.090 
tan than my body and that's because I've
been<00:00:31.619> using<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.070> boots<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.700> tan<00:00:33.620> golden<00:00:34.620> was

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
been using the boots all tan golden was

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.479 
been using the boots all tan golden was
it<00:00:35.250> called<00:00:35.399> gradually<00:00:36.030> golden<00:00:37.489> face

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it called gradually golden face

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.010 
it called gradually golden face
moisturizer<00:00:38.969> which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> gradual

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
moisturizer which is like a gradual

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.610 
moisturizer which is like a gradual
tanner<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> face<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> guess<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.469> like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
tanner for the face so I guess it's like

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770 
tanner for the face so I guess it's like
not<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.309> gradual<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.820> pretty<00:00:45.059> potent<00:00:45.510> so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
not that gradual is pretty potent so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.260

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
one so it's super pigmented and it looks

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.940 
one so it's super pigmented and it looks
really<00:02:14.160> pretty

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.130 

there's<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.519> swatched<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.150> my<00:02:18.299> hand<00:02:18.660> and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
there's that swatched on my hand and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.970 
there's that swatched on my hand and
then<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> gray<00:02:20.519> one<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:22.709> you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
then the gray one is like this like you

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.500 
then the gray one is like this like you
just<00:02:23.129> need<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> light<00:02:23.610> swipe<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.299> all

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
just need a light swipe and you get all

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
of that color on your fingers so there's

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.250 
of that color on your fingers so there's
that<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.140> swatch<00:02:29.099> next<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.549> brown<00:02:29.840> now<00:02:30.840> as

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that one swatch next to the brown now as

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.170 
that one swatch next to the brown now as
you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.590> see<00:02:31.860> these<00:02:32.160> are<00:02:32.370> super<00:02:32.790> pigmented

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you can see these are super pigmented

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.069 
you can see these are super pigmented
and<00:02:33.690> they<00:02:34.500> are<00:02:34.620> quite<00:02:34.860> soft<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.660> problem

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
and they are quite soft but the problem

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.150 
and they are quite soft but the problem
I<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.380> with<00:02:37.410> these<00:02:37.680> eyeshadows<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.579> that

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
I have with these eyeshadows is that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
I have with these eyeshadows is that
they<00:02:41.160> are<00:02:41.549> impossible<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.269> blend<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.870> get

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
they are impossible to blend you get

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.569 
they are impossible to blend you get
them<00:02:43.349> on<00:02:43.530> your<00:02:43.560> eyelid<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:47.040> know<00:02:47.160> when

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
them on your eyelid and you know when

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.850 
them on your eyelid and you know when
your<00:02:47.760> brush<00:02:48.030> touches<00:02:48.360> your<00:02:48.599> skin<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.110> deposits

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
your brush touches your skin it deposits

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.759 
your brush touches your skin it deposits
like<00:02:50.130> loads<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.730> color<00:02:50.989> but<00:02:51.989> if<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.470> try<00:02:52.739> to

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
like loads of color but if you try to

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.680 
like loads of color but if you try to
blend<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.549> just<00:02:53.700> won't<00:02:53.940> budge<00:02:54.180> it'll<00:02:54.510> just

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
blend it it just won't budge it'll just

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.240 
blend it it just won't budge it'll just
stay<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.079> spot<00:02:55.349> that<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.530> first<00:02:55.890> applied

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
stay in the spot that you first applied

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.509 
stay in the spot that you first applied
it<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:58.319> why<00:02:58.530> I'm<00:02:58.769> not<00:02:58.950> too<00:02:59.190> fond<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
it to so that's why I'm not too fond of

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.819 
it to so that's why I'm not too fond of
these<00:02:59.610> eyeshadows<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:02.690> mean<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.720> use<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.049> eyelid

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
these eyeshadows I mean I use a eyelid

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.220 
these eyeshadows I mean I use a eyelid
primer<00:03:05.130> before<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.150> apply<00:03:06.389> my<00:03:06.420> eyeshadows<00:03:07.019> so

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
primer before I apply my eyeshadows so

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.160 
primer before I apply my eyeshadows so
maybe<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:08.030> made<00:03:09.030> them<00:03:09.299> harder<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.750> blend<00:03:09.870> but

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
maybe that made them harder to blend but

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.080 
maybe that made them harder to blend but
I<00:03:10.230> usually<00:03:10.680> don't<00:03:10.799> have<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.040> problem<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.519> that

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
I usually don't have a problem with that

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.629 
I usually don't have a problem with that
my<00:03:12.900> few<00:03:13.109> faced<00:03:13.260> shadow<00:03:13.290> insurance<00:03:13.639> doesn't

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
my few faced shadow insurance doesn't

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.759 
my few faced shadow insurance doesn't
affect<00:03:15.060> how<00:03:15.450> blendable<00:03:16.019> my<00:03:16.170> eyeshadows<00:03:16.620> are

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
affect how blendable my eyeshadows are

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.860 
affect how blendable my eyeshadows are
so<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:17.639> probably<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.389> formula<00:03:18.690> of

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
so it's probably just the formula of

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.090 
so it's probably just the formula of
these<00:03:19.019> eyeshadows<00:03:21.200> they're<00:03:22.200> both<00:03:22.500> equally

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
these eyeshadows they're both equally

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.729 
these eyeshadows they're both equally
hard<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.430> blend<00:03:24.319> although<00:03:25.319> they're<00:03:25.530> really

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
hard to blend although they're really

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.830 
hard to blend although they're really
pigmented<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.700> know<00:03:26.819> if<00:03:27.000> they're<00:03:27.239> really

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
pigmented but you know if they're really

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.809 
pigmented but you know if they're really
hard<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.139> work<00:03:28.350> with<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.859> don't<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.670> there's

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
hard to work with I don't think there's

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.940 
hard to work with I don't think there's
much<00:03:30.000> point<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.389> getting<00:03:30.540> them<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> actually

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
much point in getting them so I actually

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.789 
much point in getting them so I actually
have<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.400> gray<00:03:32.700> one<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.209> today<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.319> am<00:03:34.349> it

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
have the gray one on today but I am it

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.220 
have the gray one on today but I am it
would<00:03:34.889> turn<00:03:35.130> out<00:03:35.160> really<00:03:35.489> patchy<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> ended

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
would turn out really patchy so I ended

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.129 
would turn out really patchy so I ended
up<00:03:37.319> blending<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.310> my<00:03:38.849> Dior<00:03:39.329> eyeshadow<00:03:39.989> on

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
up blending like my Dior eyeshadow on

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.740 
up blending like my Dior eyeshadow on
top<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.859> even<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.310> out<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.569> a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
top of it just to even it out so it's a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.289 
top of it just to even it out so it's a
really<00:03:42.959> big<00:03:43.079> hassle<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:44.069> haven't<00:03:44.760> tried<00:03:45.060> any

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
really big hassle so I haven't tried any

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.690 
really big hassle so I haven't tried any
of<00:03:45.419> their<00:03:45.599> other<00:03:45.630> products<00:03:46.410> but<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:47.340> wouldn't

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
of their other products but I wouldn't

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.120 
of their other products but I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:47.849> these<00:03:48.329> micro<00:03:48.750> shadows<00:03:49.139> maybe

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
recommend these micro shadows maybe

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.120 
recommend these micro shadows maybe
their<00:03:50.400> other<00:03:50.549> stuff<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.970> good<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.660> know

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
their other stuff is good but you know

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.530 
their other stuff is good but you know
after<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.160> experience<00:03:53.790> I'm<00:03:53.970> not<00:03:54.000> too

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
after that experience I'm not too

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.610 
after that experience I'm not too
tempted<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.319> go<00:03:55.470> back<00:03:55.760> for<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.079> went<00:03:58.560> to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
tempted to go back for more so I went to
