00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
on the back of it it kind of makes it

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.790 
on the back of it it kind of makes it
awkward<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.730> heavy<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.870> trying<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> get

installing a new head
you<00:00:41.879> always<00:00:42.090> need<00:00:42.540> new<00:00:42.840> head<00:00:43.170> bolts<00:00:43.820> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you always need new head bolts so

you always need new head bolts so
instead<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.480> discarding<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> old<00:00:46.500> ones<00:00:46.739> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
instead of discarding the old ones this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.569 
instead of discarding the old ones this
is<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.469> did<00:00:49.649> was

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
is what you do with them what we did was

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.880 
is what you do with them what we did was
we<00:00:50.610> put<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.239> old<00:00:51.600> head<00:00:51.870> bolt<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.379> vise<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
we put the old head bolt and a vise and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
we put the old head bolt and a vise and
we<00:00:53.280> took<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> die<00:00:53.699> grinder<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.270> cut<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> head

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
we took a die grinder and cut the head

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.260 
we took a die grinder and cut the head
of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> bolt<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.850> we're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
of the bolt off and what we're going to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
of the bolt off and what we're going to
do<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.719> very<00:01:00.719> loosely<00:01:01.260> maybe<00:01:01.800> two<00:01:02.070> or

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
do is just very loosely maybe two or

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.490 
do is just very loosely maybe two or
three<00:01:02.219> threads<00:01:02.730> into<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.930> block<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.500> search

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
three threads into the block and search

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.570 
three threads into the block and search
them<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.570> these<00:01:09.750> act<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.860> guides

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
them so now what these act as are guides

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.510 
them so now what these act as are guides
so<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.200> end<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.619> tearing<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so that you don't end up tearing up the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
so that you don't end up tearing up the
newly<00:01:15.270> installed<00:01:15.720> head<00:01:15.990> gasket<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
newly installed head gasket that you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.399 
newly installed head gasket that you
just<00:01:16.860> put<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.900> because<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> don't

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just put on there because if you don't

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.760 
just put on there because if you don't
have<00:01:19.710> them<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> said<00:01:21.600> before<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
have them with like I said before the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160 
have them with like I said before the
weight<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> head<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> trying<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.960> lean

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
weight of the head and trying to lean

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.039 
weight of the head and trying to lean
over<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.369> easily<00:01:26.610> gouge<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.540> gasket

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
over you can easily gouge the gasket

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.640 
over you can easily gouge the gasket
with<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> any<00:01:29.250> corner<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> head<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
with the any corner of the head so this

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.539 
with the any corner of the head so this
will<00:01:31.979> even<00:01:32.490> eliminate<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.450> problem<00:01:34.549> before

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
will even eliminate that problem before

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.260 
will even eliminate that problem before
you<00:01:35.970> put<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:37.020> head<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.520> need<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> check

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you put a new head on you need to check

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
you put a new head on you need to check
it<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:40.049> sometimes<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.680> put<00:01:40.890> an<00:01:41.040> anti

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it because sometimes they put an anti

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
it because sometimes they put an anti
rust<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:42.119> corrosion<00:01:42.540> coating<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
rust or corrosion coating on them and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.160 
rust or corrosion coating on them and
you<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> take<00:01:44.610> some<00:01:44.939> non<00:01:45.450> oil-based

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
you need to take some non oil-based

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
you need to take some non oil-based
solvent<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.040> wipe<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.880> off<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.240> bottom<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
solvent and wipe that off the bottom of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.510 
solvent and wipe that off the bottom of
the<00:01:48.630> head<00:01:48.810> before<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.259> install<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.130> onto<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the head before you install it onto the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.460 
the head before you install it onto the
head<00:01:50.670> gasket<00:01:51.119> because<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.810> could<00:01:52.020> give<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
head gasket because that could give you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.520 
head gasket because that could give you
some<00:01:52.710> sealing<00:01:53.070> issues<00:01:53.659> um<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.110> reason<00:01:55.259> why

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
some sealing issues um the reason why

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.190 
some sealing issues um the reason why
we're<00:01:55.799> putting<00:01:56.340> these<00:01:56.670> dowels<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:58.049> ice

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
we're putting these dowels in like ice

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
we're putting these dowels in like ice
mentioned<00:01:58.799> earlier<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.000> extra<00:02:00.360> weight<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
mentioned earlier is the extra weight of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
mentioned earlier is the extra weight of
this<00:02:00.780> manifold<00:02:01.290> makes<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.189> awkward<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
this manifold makes it very awkward and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600 
this manifold makes it very awkward and
for<00:02:03.180> me<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.450> handle<00:02:03.869> leaning<00:02:04.619> over<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.040> front

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
for me to handle leaning over the front

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
for me to handle leaning over the front
of<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.820> vehicle<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> don't

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
of this vehicle like this and I don't

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.169 
of this vehicle like this and I don't
want<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> tear<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.710> head<00:02:07.950> gasket<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.940> those

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
want to tear up the head gasket so those

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.309 
want to tear up the head gasket so those
dowels
