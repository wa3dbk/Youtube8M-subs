00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.400
I’ll show you how to fit and wear bra with dress with bare shoulders 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.320
This is balconette which we’ve been wearing for many years

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.480
It’s always been sliding down and changing it’s place around our waist

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.480
We’ve always been stressed as we had to hide in the corner and pull the bra up

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.280
It’s because of the fact that it has always been too loose at the back

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.820
It’s always had a bit small cups 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.200
When it’s too loosely in here the breast fall into a bra cup in an unattractive way

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:52.296
The whole mystery is the proper way of putting the bra on and shaping the body

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.260
The whole mystery is the proper way of putting the bra on and shaping the body

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.660
We put it below our breast, fasten at the back and then you’ll see how easily the shape is created.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.380
As we get a huge amount of breast at the front

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.160
The first step- I pull the bra at the top and cling

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.960
Then from the one and other side I gather these parts and cling under arms above

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.180
And now we should have a great effect at the front

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:44.120
The last step – magical breast fitting in the cleavage , from the side to the centre

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.960
I promise that Magda will be jumping in this bra till the morning
