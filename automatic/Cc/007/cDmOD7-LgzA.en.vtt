downward spiral creates a downward

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.869 
downward spiral creates a downward
spiral<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:00.739> gets<00:01:00.890> faster<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.609> faster

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
spiral and it gets faster and faster

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.330 
spiral and it gets faster and faster
like<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.449> swirl<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.289> then<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:03.739> go<00:01:03.949> through<00:01:03.980> a

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 
like a swirl and then you go through a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.470 
like a swirl and then you go through a
swirl<00:01:04.700> but<00:01:05.390> an<00:01:05.510> upward<00:01:05.930> spiral<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:07.480> feeling

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
swirl but an upward spiral of feeling

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
swirl but an upward spiral of feeling
successful<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:10.330> dominating<00:01:11.330> creates<00:01:12.110> more

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
successful and dominating creates more

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.950 
successful and dominating creates more
of<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.850> question<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:14.450> when<00:01:14.810> you're

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
of that and the question is when you're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.150 
of that and the question is when you're
going<00:01:15.470> into<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:16.340> downward<00:01:17.000> spiral<00:01:18.040> when<00:01:19.040> you

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
going into a downward spiral when you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.950 
going into a downward spiral when you

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
the brakes on it it almost does nothing

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.270 
the brakes on it it almost does nothing
the<00:01:23.930> brakes<00:01:24.200> go<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.650> floor<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:25.100> keep

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the brakes go to the floor and you keep

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.460 
the brakes go to the floor and you keep
going<00:01:25.610> faster<00:01:26.150> into<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.480> downward<00:01:26.720> spiral

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
going faster into the downward spiral

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.220 
going faster into the downward spiral

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
your business the more you resist it the

your business the more you resist it the
the<00:02:29.040> worse<00:02:29.250> it'll<00:02:29.520> get<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:31.020> how<00:02:31.410> you

the worse it'll get and that's how you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.050
