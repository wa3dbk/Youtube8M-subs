00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.890
 Those who don't really want that show 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.990
 Work on the spot 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 It is a plan to buy, but 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 Well I in here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.980
 I actually buy it on the net because I want it to buy 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.820
 So I do not enter into modeling 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.300
 I would also like to buy this lens but is a private affair 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.250
 Say what to buy what of the lens 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.150
 Before the story, this is actually this 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.880

 I went in to say that I think we determined 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:21.860
 Even though it was about to say that I bought here, which has been newly released 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:24.870
 There is a reason to choose another pass 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.380
 When I went to buy it 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.240
 In a great showcase 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.090
 One Olympus lens was included. 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.760

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.890

 A day to come will come 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.450
 I thought to 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.550
 There was one thing that we decided to Olympus 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:25.760

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:30.829
 Finally It is that time is a A'that we have been doing in fact this week 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:36.720

 I 'm going to the highway 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.090
 not really 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:52.480
 I do not want to go with great equipment 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:56.610

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:03.960

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.180
 Normal lens and professional lens 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.050

 It looks really good, isn't it? 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.240
 It is said that you can get up to 300mm with f 2.8 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.110
 It is 1.4 to be applied 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:53.310
 There are also some that the converter is supposed to be 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.980
 Then Te is also up to 420 mm in 35 mm conversion would arrive in the data 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.159

 Although it is a high lens , it is the highest mark when you are buying it 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.200
 It's a high days, but considering the specifications
