00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:17.189
 the shortest route bunkers and their cars which were 3 to 13 in Stockholm 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.150
 the intelligent and flexible answers to the challenges at the 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.359
 beet harvest 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.030
 the 480 hp powerhouse 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.590
 works extremely economically with the normal as an executive 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.829
 the photo subject controlling the speed and it also looks a bit drive 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.530
 significantly reduces fuel consumption 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.980
 are they increase the performance 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 so he stays for Atos Sphere Dry 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.150
 fit for use 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
 that means 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.790
 Fame faded comfort cabin provides perfect overview 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.810
 the driver had all functions in view 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.940
 and can adjust immediately if necessary 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.690
 on the field he brings by 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.900
 Hoster remains unloading warns 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 standing under the approximately gate in the work position 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.810
 unimaginable fastbreak 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.810
 he then defines the desired Schwegler height 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.340
 the script and red aggregate 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.840
 Adjusts independently from the vehicle required 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.570
 The t3 often works extremely difficult 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 and give the terrain 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.380
 the distance between east and west side stars 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.070
 Loose adjust 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.910
 Peter Eichen TERA tires 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.899
 they provide a large footprint 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.999
 In addition, Error Docs jeopardizes the 3 track while living 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.130
 so did Ackerboden 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.130
 maximum shorn 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.329
 the t3 is extremely thin 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.870
 has a very small turning radius of just 8 meters to the finish 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:43.719
 Another advantage being its 30 degree crease makes it especially preheated 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.719
 Enron flexible and fast 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.090
 and also in difficult terrain 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.359
 TERA Docs shows the 3 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.349
 even the sloping was managed on steeply sloping Parker he secures 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.549
 the t3 is automatically licked 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.149
 over the ice is or the Schalke keeper 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.149
 which is directly on the rear axle around the front axle 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:24.829
 This allows the driver to concentrate fully on the actual harvesting process 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.149
 The driver sets the desired Schwegler via the Reverb button 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.189
 the result 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.479
 optimal quality 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.339
 The harvesting functions of the c3 convince with highest precision 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.519
 the average thickness of the night 11 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 adjustable from outside the cab 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.580
 who scatters Heller supplement snowflakes 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.580
 spread the leaves evenly over the field 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:08.009
 the Terra only the 3 loves the challenge 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.129
 whether on snow 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.349
 also stony soils 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.789
 Here they exercise the fields with extreme pressure 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:18.699
 the superior technology of the "Toronto Sun" provides even the most difficult 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:19.749
 conditions 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.509
 for optimal harvest results 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.000
 the combination Schwegler 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.719
 combines two functions 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.999
 These can be changed at any time from the cab 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.680
 as a place Schwegler he distributes the petal evenly over the 

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:34.719
 field 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.479
 as a capital, more Victor beats the lying leaf directly between the ranks 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.919
 so the nutrients are traced back to very precise messengers 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.340
 on a monitor 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.009
 the driver sees different functions 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.009
 for example, the cleaning praised 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.830
 were writing with values 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.969
 slug 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.909
 the offender gives an approx 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.129
 mÂ³ big bunker 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.409
 about the adjustable in the speed revise construction 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.779
 can the driver give 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.909
 Profen overloaded driving vehicle 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.629
 another keratosis the three function 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.629
 the highest profitability 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 followed the emptying of the bunker 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.990
 through easy access to the individual components 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.490
 the Wehrer Docs 3 is especially easy to maintain and use 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.590
 quality 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.620
 and performance 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.490
 also the continuous operation by day and night 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.339
 the Terra Dospel 3 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.159
 combines user-friendly innovations 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.110
 highest efficiency 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.110
 a safe 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.939
 get what service team 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.520
 Bregenz the convincing performance 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.460
 with a customized package of advice 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.460
 and services 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.869
 intelligent technology 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.339
 for efficiency and what follows 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.270
 Carlos 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.330
 just a tenant Holmar 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.199
 Success from experience
