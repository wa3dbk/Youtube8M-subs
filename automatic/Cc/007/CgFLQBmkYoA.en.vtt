00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:14.550
 ingredients 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:17.570
 [Music] 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.570
 and we started 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.289
 we cut the aubergines in halves already 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.130
 the time in squares and in a pan 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.180
 with a lid we simmer them on a low heat 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 Once roasted we extract the whole pot and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.940
 we put it on a plate we add the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.310
 cans of natural tuna scurrying 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.550
 is the water previously 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.570
 and we mix everything so that it is like that 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.570
 consistent mixture 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.170
 and we're going to put the mixture all 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.690
 these spices salt without sodium garlic in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.540
 powdered onion powder and black pepper 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.570
 to taste for fried tomato sauce 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.510
 I have chosen this purchase is very low in 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.440
 fat and it tastes very good toss 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.220
 the tablespoons 5 or 6 approximately 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.680
 that fits in one step and we mix everything and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 we are going to add oregano I have it in 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.880
 this boat because good is home makes it 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.760
 Now let's go with the eggs, even if you see 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.110

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.050
 we chop everything and put it in the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.620
 Mix it well and remove it 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.110
 everything quite homogeneous and it has to be filled 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.820
 the aubergines that is pretty simple 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.040
 with a spoon we are filling all the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.860
 Aubergine skin and finally 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.100
