00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
from the red paint that we're going to

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.410 
from the red paint that we're going to
use<00:02:59.150> in<00:02:59.359> just<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.959> moment<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:00.909> to<00:03:01.909> make<00:03:02.150> my

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
use in just a moment so to make my

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.599 
use in just a moment so to make my
vertical<00:03:02.870> lines<00:03:03.530> I'm<00:03:03.950> just<00:03:04.220> going<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.370> use<00:03:04.489> the

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
vertical lines I'm just going to use the

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.270 
vertical lines I'm just going to use the
thickness<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.359> tape<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.720> help<00:03:06.230> me<00:03:06.560> with

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
thickness of the tape to help me with

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.039 
thickness of the tape to help me with
this<00:03:07.489> pattern<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.209> don't<00:03:08.359> need<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> ruler

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
this pattern so we don't need a ruler

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.899 
this pattern so we don't need a ruler
and<00:03:09.290> pencils<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.950> pens<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:10.370> all<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.639> stuff

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
and pencils and pens and all that stuff

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.399 
and pencils and pens and all that stuff
so<00:03:11.750> there<00:03:12.470> goes<00:03:12.650> one<00:03:12.920> stripe<00:03:14.290> then<00:03:15.290> you're

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
so there goes one stripe then you're

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.750 
so there goes one stripe then you're
gonna<00:03:15.530> want<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.769> make<00:03:15.920> sure<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.220> press<00:03:16.459> down

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
gonna want to make sure you press down

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.449 
gonna want to make sure you press down
each<00:03:17.060> layer<00:03:17.599> or<00:03:17.930> each<00:03:18.260> stripe<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:19.220> really

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
each layer or each stripe really really

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.610 
each layer or each stripe really really
well<00:03:19.639> because<00:03:19.879> this<00:03:20.359> will<00:03:20.900> make<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.109> difference

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
well because this will make a difference

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.289 
well because this will make a difference
when<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:21.919> pull<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.400> tape<00:03:22.609> off<00:03:22.639> to<00:03:23.120> reveal

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
when you pull the tape off to reveal

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.689 
when you pull the tape off to reveal
your<00:03:23.959> stripe<00:03:24.379> then<00:03:25.190> I'm<00:03:25.310> gonna<00:03:25.430> be<00:03:25.519> using

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
your stripe then I'm gonna be using

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.199 
your stripe then I'm gonna be using
another<00:03:26.419> strip<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.410> tape<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.129> as<00:03:28.849> you<00:03:29.000> can<00:03:29.150> see

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
another strip of tape and as you can see

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.110 
another strip of tape and as you can see
this<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.959> how<00:03:30.139> I'm<00:03:30.349> measuring<00:03:30.889> how<00:03:31.519> far<00:03:31.879> apart

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
this is how I'm measuring how far apart

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.539 
this is how I'm measuring how far apart
each<00:03:32.720> stripe<00:03:33.049> is<00:03:33.230> going<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> be<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:34.489> I'm

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
each stripe is going to be so then I'm

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.030 
each stripe is going to be so then I'm
going<00:03:34.669> to<00:03:34.699> add<00:03:34.819> another<00:03:35.269> piece<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.500> tape<00:03:36.739> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
going to add another piece of tape and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.460 
going to add another piece of tape and
then<00:03:37.489> remove<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.239> second<00:03:38.720> piece<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:39.019> tape<00:03:39.199> and

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
then remove the second piece of tape and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:04:13.020 
then remove the second piece of tape and
then<00:03:40.129> continue<00:03:40.699> the<00:03:40.730> same<00:03:41.030> process

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.370 

okay<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.090> now<00:04:14.420> we're<00:04:14.630> ready<00:04:14.840> for<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.200> red

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
the red paint making sure that we keep

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.840 
the red paint making sure that we keep

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
it on the red side now it's time for the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.250 
it on the red side now it's time for the
stars<00:04:59.330> on<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.560> opposite<00:05:01.070> side<00:05:01.720> so<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:03.020> just

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
stars on the opposite side so I just

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.490 
stars on the opposite side so I just
used<00:05:03.590> some<00:05:04.490> scrapbooking<00:05:05.240> stickers<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.139> I

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
used some scrapbooking stickers and I

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.650 
used some scrapbooking stickers and I
like<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.550> fact<00:05:07.790> that<00:05:07.940> these<00:05:08.150> are<00:05:08.210> different

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
like the fact that these are different

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.719 
like the fact that these are different
sizes<00:05:09.139> it<00:05:09.500> just<00:05:09.680> gives<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:09.950> a<00:05:10.040> little<00:05:10.250> bit<00:05:10.460> more

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
sizes it just gives it a little bit more

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.710 
sizes it just gives it a little bit more
of<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:11.000> neat<00:05:11.410> flavor<00:05:12.410> or<00:05:12.910> just<00:05:13.910> uniqueness<00:05:14.510> all

pretty much the same technique just

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.880 
pretty much the same technique just
cutting<00:07:16.270> out<00:07:16.420> a<00:07:16.750> little<00:07:17.230> sliver<00:07:17.650> of<00:07:17.800> the

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
cutting out a little sliver of the

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.380 
cutting out a little sliver of the
