their event two weeks ago so what is
that<00:02:17.879> particular<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.690> their<00:02:18.840> first

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
that particular I think their first

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.050

going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.260> show<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.620> console<00:02:20.129> itself<00:02:20.250> what

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
going to show the console itself what

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.910 
going to show the console itself what
it's<00:02:21.209> going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.450> look<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.230> specs<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
it's going to look like the specs on it

the<00:02:23.310> actual<00:02:23.549> design<00:02:24.000> further<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.510> think

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
the actual design further I think

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.149 
the actual design further I think
they're<00:02:24.810> gonna<00:02:24.900> tell<00:02:25.140> us<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.260> price<00:02:25.709> how<00:02:26.099> much

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
in different bundles variants I think

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
in different bundles variants I think
they're<00:02:29.489> also<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.970> show<00:02:30.090> with<00:02:30.269> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
launch title games might perhaps be I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.860 
launch title games might perhaps be I
think<00:02:32.580> we'll<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:32.940> some<00:02:33.150> actual<00:02:33.480> gameplay

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
think we'll see some actual gameplay

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.900 
think we'll see some actual gameplay
being<00:02:34.349> run<00:02:34.590> off<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.739> console<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.430> opposed<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
being run off the console as opposed to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.880 
being run off the console as opposed to
off<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> developer<00:02:36.810> unit<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.349> last<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.739> think

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
off a developer unit so last I think

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.380 
off a developer unit so last I think
there's<00:02:38.010> gonna<00:02:38.069> be<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.250> lot<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.430> talk<00:02:38.640> about<00:02:38.670> 4k

2007<00:03:22.019> but<00:03:22.169> things<00:03:22.349> work<00:03:22.500> very<00:03:22.739> well<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.250> for

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the most part the operating system

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.720 
the most part the operating system
functions<00:03:25.200> as<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.530> should<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.980> think<00:03:26.250> what<00:03:26.430> iOS

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
functions as it should I think what iOS

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.220 
functions as it should I think what iOS
has<00:03:26.880> had<00:03:27.000> going<00:03:27.209> for<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.599> actually<00:03:27.660> made<00:03:28.109> it

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
has had going for and actually made it

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.720 
has had going for and actually made it
unique<00:03:28.410> at<00:03:28.739> least<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.069> past<00:03:29.340> has<00:03:29.700> been

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
unique at least in the past has been

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.370 
unique at least in the past has been
application<00:03:30.630> support<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.019> that's<00:03:31.079> really

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
application support and that's really

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.229 
application support and that's really
been<00:03:31.560> their<00:03:31.739> calling<00:03:32.220> card<00:03:32.250> over<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> past

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
been their calling card over the past

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.080 
been their calling card over the past
few<00:03:33.450> years<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:34.169> during<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.620> timeframe

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
few years but during that timeframe

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.789 
few years but during that timeframe
androids<00:03:36.090> come<00:03:36.419> on<00:03:36.630> really<00:03:37.109> strong<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
androids come on really strong so I

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.740 
androids come on really strong so I

with<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:53.010> hardware<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:53.639> they<00:03:53.730> don't

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
with the hardware there so they don't

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.970

some of that mind share it certainly has

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.589 
some of that mind share it certainly has
taken<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:11.010> toll<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.549> their<00:04:11.940> stock<00:04:12.180> price<00:04:12.449> as
