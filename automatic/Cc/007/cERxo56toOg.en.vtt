this red colored lace dress and we
actually<00:00:33.270> kind<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.010> repurposed<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> gold<00:00:35.370> chain

so I think it's a really great accessory

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.880 
so I think it's a really great accessory
to<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.270> complement<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.020> fit<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
to you know complement the fit and I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
to you know complement the fit and I
love<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> blend<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.550> colors<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.090> watch

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
love the blend of colors with the watch

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.029 
love the blend of colors with the watch
and<00:00:45.539> everything<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.620> really<00:00:46.770> kind

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and everything because it's really kind

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.860 
and everything because it's really kind
of<00:00:47.129> jewel<00:00:47.399> tones<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.539> work<00:00:48.719> well

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
of jewel tones so I think they work well

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.000 
of jewel tones so I think they work well
together<00:00:49.050> even<00:00:49.530> though<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
together even though it's kind of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.029 
together even though it's kind of
unexpected<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> style<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
unexpected if you have a style that you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.790 
unexpected if you have a style that you
really<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.539> firing<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.719> try<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.649> you're

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
really are firing to try out but you're

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.170 
really are firing to try out but you're
a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:56.160> afraid<00:00:56.399> maybe<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> your

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
a little afraid maybe it's out of your

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.360 
a little afraid maybe it's out of your
comfort<00:00:57.420> zone<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.050> would<00:00:58.500> say<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.680> go<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
comfort zone I would say just go for it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
comfort zone I would say just go for it
if<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.879> mix<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.449> another<00:01:00.750> style<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
if you mix it with another style that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.959 
if you mix it with another style that
you're<00:01:01.829> more<00:01:01.980> comfortable<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you're more comfortable with and that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
you're more comfortable with and that
you<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:03.989> pair<00:01:04.589> those<00:01:04.769> two

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
you do a lot then pair those two

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.200 
you do a lot then pair those two
together<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> great<00:01:05.790> way<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> get

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
together and it's a great way to get

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
together and it's a great way to get
started<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.720> trying<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.560> different<00:01:07.590> styles

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
started with trying out different styles

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
started with trying out different styles
I<00:01:08.580> also<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.420> different<00:01:09.689> patterns<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I also think for different patterns you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
I also think for different patterns you
want<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> wear<00:01:10.619> stuff<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.369> doesn't<00:01:11.610> clash

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
want to wear stuff that doesn't clash

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.969 
want to wear stuff that doesn't clash
but<00:01:12.420> still<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.869> coordinate<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> look<00:01:13.740> really

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but still can coordinate and look really

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
but still can coordinate and look really
cool<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.460> combine<00:01:14.760> different<00:01:14.970> patterns<00:01:15.509> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
cool to combine different patterns and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
cool to combine different patterns and
find<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> feel<00:01:16.890> confident<00:01:17.369> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
find out what you feel confident in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
find out what you feel confident in
that's<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> most<00:01:18.509> important<00:01:18.900> thing

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that's one of the most important thing

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.210 
that's one of the most important thing
else<00:01:19.170> especially<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
