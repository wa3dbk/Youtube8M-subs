market one of which is our flexible tape
and<00:00:29.859> essentially<00:00:30.339> it's<00:00:30.489> got<00:00:30.669> bands<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.210> metal

apply to the regular paper tape that you

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.810 
apply to the regular paper tape that you
would<00:00:33.370> find<00:00:33.550> anywhere<00:00:35.250> you'd<00:00:36.250> fold<00:00:36.520> it<00:00:36.700> in

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
would find anywhere you'd fold it in

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.200 
would find anywhere you'd fold it in
half<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:38.250> tape<00:00:39.250> it<00:00:39.400> to<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.580> wall<00:00:39.820> now<00:00:40.060> what

half and tape it to the wall now what

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.540 
half and tape it to the wall now what
does<00:00:40.330> this<00:00:40.420> do<00:00:40.660> if<00:00:40.900> there's<00:00:41.410> any<00:00:41.590> deviation<00:00:41.860> in

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
does this do if there's any deviation in

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.790 
does this do if there's any deviation in

the wall board here as far as surface
area<00:00:45.220> or<00:00:45.550> voids<00:00:46.000> this<00:00:46.960> will<00:00:47.200> help<00:00:47.380> take<00:00:47.560> up<00:00:47.740> the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
area or voids this will help take up the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.590 
area or voids this will help take up the
gap<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.250> it'll<00:00:48.490> keep<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.940> pretty<00:00:49.180> straight

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
gap and it'll keep a pretty straight

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.569 
gap and it'll keep a pretty straight
line<00:00:49.900> which<00:00:50.380> essentially<00:00:50.770> makes<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.220> easier

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
line which essentially makes it easier

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.810 
line which essentially makes it easier
for<00:00:51.880> you<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.420> apply<00:00:53.050> tape<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.680> get<00:00:54.490> a<00:00:54.520> good

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
for you to apply tape and get a good

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.970 
for you to apply tape and get a good
finished<00:00:55.180> product<00:00:55.570> what<00:00:55.720> it's<00:00:55.840> done<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.800> let's

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
finished product what it's done so let's

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.310 
finished product what it's done so let's
begin<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.550> process<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.960> I'm<00:00:59.020> going<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.170> take

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
begin the process so I'm going to take

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.060 
begin the process so I'm going to take
some<00:00:59.500> compound<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:02.440> going<00:01:02.560> to<00:01:02.620> apply<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:02.860> to

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
some compound I'm going to apply it to

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:11.070 
some compound I'm going to apply it to
our<00:01:03.100> model

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.190 

okay<00:01:11.940> I'm<00:01:12.940> gonna<00:01:13.090> make<00:01:13.270> sure<00:01:13.300> that<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.960> void

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
okay I'm gonna make sure that the void

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.550 
okay I'm gonna make sure that the void
in<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.470> middle<00:01:14.620> is<00:01:14.890> filled<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:17.110> best<00:01:17.380> as<00:01:17.500> we

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
in the middle is filled as best as we

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.060 
in the middle is filled as best as we
can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
can

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.070 
can
I'm<00:01:18.340> gonna<00:01:18.490> apply<00:01:18.700> our<00:01:18.880> tape<00:01:21.720> now<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.780> real

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
I'm gonna apply our tape now the real

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.620 
I'm gonna apply our tape now the real
trick<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.070> find<00:01:24.460> once<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.300> apply

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
trick to this that I find once you apply

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.020 
trick to this that I find once you apply
the<00:01:25.660> tape<00:01:28.230> and<00:01:29.230> you<00:01:30.160> set<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.730> let<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:30.910> dry

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
the tape and you set it and let it dry

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.830 
the tape and you set it and let it dry
excuse<00:01:32.020> me<00:01:33.480> you<00:01:34.480> want<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:35.520> allow<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.580> dry<00:01:36.970> but

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
excuse me you want to allow to dry but

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.560 
excuse me you want to allow to dry but
when<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.170> tape<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.680> second<00:01:39.100> coat<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:40.390> go

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
when you tape the second coat just go

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.680 
when you tape the second coat just go
over<00:01:40.750> one<00:01:41.560> side<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.190> tape<00:01:42.400> at<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:43.060> time<00:01:43.420> a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
over one side of the tape at a time a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.840 
over one side of the tape at a time a
lot<00:01:44.650> of<00:01:44.740> people<00:01:44.950> make<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.160> mistake<00:01:45.310> of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
lot of people make the mistake of

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.790 
lot of people make the mistake of
applying<00:01:46.240> both<00:01:46.510> sides<00:01:46.870> at<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:47.260> time<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.740> if

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
applying both sides at one time so if

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.850 
applying both sides at one time so if
you<00:01:47.860> let<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:48.480> dry<00:01:49.480> this<00:01:49.960> little<00:01:50.230> residue<00:01:50.650> and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
you let this dry this little residue and

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.890 
you let this dry this little residue and
I've<00:01:50.950> left<00:01:51.160> a<00:01:51.250> lot<00:01:51.430> this<00:01:51.940> little<00:01:52.270> residue<00:01:52.570> here

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
I've left a lot this little residue here

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.990 
I've left a lot this little residue here
would<00:01:53.080> just<00:01:53.260> pop<00:01:53.470> right<00:01:53.740> off<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.340> then<00:01:54.880> you'll

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
would just pop right off and then you'll

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.490 
would just pop right off and then you'll
be<00:01:55.060> able<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.450> coat<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.810> other<00:01:55.930> side<00:01:56.170> when<00:01:56.410> it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
be able to coat the other side when it

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.380 
be able to coat the other side when it
dries<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.980> you<00:01:57.280> repeat<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.730> process<00:01:57.910> as<00:01:58.330> many

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
dries and you repeat the process as many

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.090 
dries and you repeat the process as many
times<00:01:58.690> as<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.110> need<00:01:59.260> to<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.710> finished

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
times as you need to get the finished
