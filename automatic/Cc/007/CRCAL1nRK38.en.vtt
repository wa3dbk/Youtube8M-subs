00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
which was a really a different

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.730

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
got this rude awakening that I probably

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.819 
got this rude awakening that I probably
wasn't<00:02:40.569> as<00:02:40.780> good<00:02:41.019> as<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.290> thought<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:41.799> was

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.170 
think I'm really lucky that it worked
out<00:03:11.500> because<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.980> really<00:03:12.190> was<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.730> kind<00:03:13.060> of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
out because it really was just kind of

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.750
