00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.529
 welcome back to the pds 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.200
 I showed tutoria about the system 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.509
 you like her from a crime the itunes 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.450
 so you can produce directly here 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:22.529
 pure damn should be up for it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.090
 a body already built up and behind 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.519
 I have to change a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.080
 Although not noted a particular 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.390
 the normal in the chest gives this 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 but an android chris means the same 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.719
 how to make obsidian facebook is when 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.450
 to refuel here will change 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.040
 get along 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.399
 the distance to the reception with 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.600
 given lapis lazuli 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:59.000
 that has an extra reason so it goes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:02.699
 back here is my system 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.899
 could build the door into the deep and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.630
 let it pass over itself 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.110
 just a few cables 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.110
 about that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 that was wrong and that is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.580
 so we need only times in ner crate 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.250
 here again the color code now 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.790
 we are building here is a special cable 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 A basic import bass is what you do 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.770
 so in the cable interface two iron city 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.270
 pisten in the interface makes you so andreas 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.820
 kÃ¼ttel for yourself is more 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.250
 we'll get the best shift and stuff like that 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.700
 ran 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.860
 but that should I not now so 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.040
 go on 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.040
 I'm sorry 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.540
 10 then he imports all the old ones 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.140
 they are here 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.820
 after the automatic system of 1003 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.220
 Grasbrook in the system 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.880
 It's time I had the curry 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.880
 do 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.280
 I like it with a quantum generator 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.770
 now he should go to the inclusion of eight 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.770
 swiss smb 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.150
 engine webkit engine 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.370
 commissioner 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.250
 and who is super prepared but does not matter 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.000
 otherwise this theme starts to build 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:05.159
 from simple to still know the student 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:09.599
 because yes and just a little stupid 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:12.209
 that's fun and now it's fun 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.620
 already forgotten back mmi system 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.620
 it goes again 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.240
 pep 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:34.070
 and that's what it's got inside 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:37.410
 so imported that's the topic 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.920
 Now we are also two types at this 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.910
 14 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:47.630
 storage but yes yes it 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.440
 definitely work 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.440
 I always want to push here 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.010
 Thanks for watching and see you 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.010
 next time bye
