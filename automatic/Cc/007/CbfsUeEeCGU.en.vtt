this to kind of open up the eyes a
little<00:03:47.019> bit<00:03:47.169> at<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> bottom<00:03:47.560> here<00:03:48.010> but<00:03:48.579> not

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
little bit at the bottom here but not

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.110 
little bit at the bottom here but not
too<00:03:48.970> much<00:03:49.150> like<00:03:49.629> that<00:03:50.669> curl<00:03:51.669> your<00:03:51.819> lashes<00:03:51.970> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
too much like that curl your lashes and

too much like that curl your lashes and
put<00:03:55.120> on<00:03:55.389> a<00:03:55.660> coat<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.169> mascara<00:03:59.609> like<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:02.489> and

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
put on a coat of mascara like that and

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.500 
put on a coat of mascara like that and
false<00:04:04.989> eyelashes<00:04:05.889> are<00:04:06.040> great<00:04:06.250> for<00:04:06.790> Asian<00:04:07.359> eyes

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
false eyelashes are great for Asian eyes

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.550 
false eyelashes are great for Asian eyes
because<00:04:09.120> Asian<00:04:10.120> eyelashes<00:04:11.019> tend<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.410> be<00:04:11.530> a

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
because Asian eyelashes tend to be a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.000 
because Asian eyelashes tend to be a
little<00:04:11.680> bit<00:04:11.919> more<00:04:12.129> shorter<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:14.010> like

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
little bit more shorter and like

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.270 
little bit more shorter and like
straighter<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:15.910> that's<00:04:16.660> when<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.440> false

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
straighter so that's when the false

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.400 
straighter so that's when the false
eyelashes<00:04:18.970> come<00:04:19.239> in<00:04:19.359> really<00:04:19.570> well<00:04:19.810> so<00:04:20.289> I'm

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
eyelashes come in really well so I'm

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.529 
eyelashes come in really well so I'm
going<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.590> take<00:04:20.739> off<00:04:20.919> one<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.430> put<00:04:21.699> it<00:04:21.729> on<00:04:21.910> okay

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
going to take off one and put it on okay

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:29.700 
going to take off one and put it on okay
so<00:04:22.660> I've<00:04:22.930> put<00:04:23.260> my<00:04:23.530> glue<00:04:24.490> on<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:28.710> eyelashes

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.399 
so I've put my glue on to the eyelashes
like<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.330> now<00:04:31.330> what<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:31.570> want<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> do<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.229> you

want to
curl<00:04:34.090> them<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.540> little<00:04:34.810> bit<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.350> this<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:37.210> it
