hi<00:00:14.790> guys<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.360> time<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.809> another<00:00:16.020> question

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
hi guys it's time for another question

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.010 
hi guys it's time for another question
answer<00:00:16.859> was<00:00:17.039> simply<00:00:17.369> intertwine<00:00:18.020> this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
answer was simply intertwine this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
answer was simply intertwine this
question<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.619> about<00:00:19.740> blankets<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:21.119> person

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
question is about blankets and a person

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.120 
question is about blankets and a person
asked<00:00:21.660> me<00:00:21.750> how<00:00:21.960> many<00:00:22.170> rows<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.800> make<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.949> baby

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
asked me how many rows to make a baby

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.810 
asked me how many rows to make a baby
blanket<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.900> isn't<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.710> question<00:00:26.670> that

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
blanket it really isn't a question that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.210 
blanket it really isn't a question that
has<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.210> meet<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.720> set<00:00:27.960> formula<00:00:28.260> because<00:00:29.039> as

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
has to meet a set formula because as

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.609 
has to meet a set formula because as
factors<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.820> come<00:00:30.000> into<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.380> loom

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
factors that come into it one the loom

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.170 
factors that come into it one the loom
you<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.830> using<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.520> example<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.030> you're

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
you are using for example if you're

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.240 
you are using for example if you're
losing<00:00:33.600> using<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> loom<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.160> has

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
losing using a loom like this that has

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069 
losing using a loom like this that has
like<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.460> small<00:00:35.730> gauge<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.570> may<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.960> do

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
like a small gauge you may have to do

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.750 
like a small gauge you may have to do
more<00:00:37.230> rows<00:00:37.530> than<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.250> iron<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.640> tea

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
more rows than you would iron if tea

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
more rows than you would iron if tea
dinner<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.510> has<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> bigger<00:00:39.989> gauge<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.440> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
dinner that has a bigger gauge which is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
dinner that has a bigger gauge which is
the<00:00:40.710> space<00:00:40.920> between<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.370> pegs<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the space between the pegs it's going to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
the space between the pegs it's going to
depend<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> yarn<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:43.710> using<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:44.430> you

factors<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.780> into<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.530> many<00:01:11.280> rows<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
factors that go into how many rows you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390 
factors that go into how many rows you
need<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.570> simple<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:14.369> know

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
need and it's not as simple as you know

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280 
need and it's not as simple as you know
asking<00:01:14.939> me<00:01:15.030> well<00:01:15.119> how<00:01:15.210> many<00:01:15.390> rows<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.750> really

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
asking me well how many rows it's really

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
asking me well how many rows it's really
hard<00:01:16.530> because<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.460> many<00:01:17.580> different

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
hard because there's so many different

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.190 
hard because there's so many different
patterns<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.270> there's<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.720> many<00:01:18.840> different

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
patterns out there's so many different

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.100 
patterns out there's so many different
looms<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.970> change<00:01:21.840> up

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
looms out there that really change up

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
looms out there that really change up
how<00:01:22.530> big<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> might<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.420> many

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
how big you might actually or how many

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.320 
how big you might actually or how many
rows<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.350> need<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:27.119> you're

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
rows you actually need so if you're

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
rows you actually need so if you're
trying<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> figure<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.810> how<00:01:27.900> many<00:01:27.960> rows<00:01:28.200> your

and<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.110> look<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.439> because<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.860> go

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and just look at this because you can go

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.530 
and just look at this because you can go
okay<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.939> read<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> foot

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
okay do I want to read this it's a foot

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.120 
okay do I want to read this it's a foot
long<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:52.140> obviously<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.740> long<00:01:52.860> enough<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
long that's obviously not long enough a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
long that's obviously not long enough a
blanket<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.299> look<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.869> use<00:01:55.170> your

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
blanket then kind of look at it use your

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
blanket then kind of look at it use your
tape<00:01:55.560> measure<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.579> give<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> visual<00:01:57.149> idea

tape measure to give you a visual idea

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
tape measure to give you a visual idea
of<00:01:57.719> how<00:01:57.840> long<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.259> may<00:01:58.409> want<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.340> again

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
of how long you may want it and again

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.999 
of how long you may want it and again
with<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.439> measure<00:02:01.799> your

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
with and what you can do is measure your

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
with and what you can do is measure your
blanket<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.670> you're<00:02:02.909> working<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.869> get

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
blanket as you're working on it to get

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
blanket as you're working on it to get
it<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.320> length<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:05.250> again<00:02:05.549> it's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
it to that length because again it's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.900 
it to that length because again it's
gonna<00:02:06.240> depend<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:07.099> number<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.700> loom

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
gonna depend on number one the loom

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.260 
gonna depend on number one the loom
you're<00:02:09.090> using<00:02:10.009> number<00:02:11.009> two<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.730> bulkiness<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you're using number two the bulkiness of

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.430 
you're using number two the bulkiness of
the<00:02:12.569> yarn

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
the yarn

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.380 
the yarn
and<00:02:13.590> number<00:02:14.010> three<00:02:14.280> how<00:02:14.790> big<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.150> want<00:02:15.240> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and number three how big you want the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210 
and number three how big you want the
blanket<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.810> begin<00:02:16.080> with<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:17.160> are

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
blanket to begin with what is what are

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.370 
blanket to begin with what is what are
you<00:02:17.310> designing<00:02:17.460> your<00:02:17.880> blanket<00:02:18.210> for<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.750> use

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
you designing your blanket for the use

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.680 
you designing your blanket for the use
of<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:19.950> again<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.430> tape<00:02:20.880> measure<00:02:21.150> is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
of it so again a tape measure is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.030 
of it so again a tape measure is
actually<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> pretty<00:02:22.350> handy<00:02:22.710> thing<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.920> have

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
actually a pretty handy thing to have

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.010 
actually a pretty handy thing to have
and<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:23.880> best<00:02:24.120> other<00:02:24.330> thing<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.810> is

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
and your best other thing to have is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.060 
and your best other thing to have is
when<00:02:25.140> you're<00:02:25.230> working<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.890> vote

when you're working on it it's a vote

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.490 
when you're working on it it's a vote
counter<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.750> you're<00:02:28.020> working<00:02:28.050> with

counter so that as you're working with
that<00:02:28.650> particular<00:02:29.100> yarn<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.330> keep<00:02:30.570> track

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
that particular yarn you can keep track

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.360 
that particular yarn you can keep track
of<00:02:30.900> your<00:02:31.170> rows<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.740> you'll<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.100> for<00:02:32.310> next

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
of your rows and you'll know for next

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.050 
of your rows and you'll know for next
time

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
time

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.790 
time
that<00:02:33.420> when<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.780> use<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.140> particular<00:02:34.290> yarn

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that when you use that particular yarn

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.820 
that when you use that particular yarn
on<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.370> particular<00:02:35.730> unit<00:02:36.180> loom<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.260> need<00:02:37.470> X

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
on that particular unit loom you need X

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.500 
on that particular unit loom you need X
amount<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.280> rows<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:38.670> keep<00:02:38.880> track<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.330> things

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
amount of rows so keep track of things

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.540 
amount of rows so keep track of things
like<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.470> will<00:02:40.590> help<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> next<00:02:41.430> time

like that it will help you the next time

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.670 
like that it will help you the next time
you<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> blanket<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.900> hope<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.320> helps

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
you do a blanket so I hope this helps

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.870 
you do a blanket so I hope this helps
again<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.250> those<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.640> three

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
again you know those are the three

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.540 
again you know those are the three
components<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.510> feel<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.260> when<00:02:46.890> people<00:02:47.250> ask<00:02:47.430> me

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
components I feel and when people ask me

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.970 
components I feel and when people ask me
on<00:02:47.850> how<00:02:47.970> many<00:02:48.030> rows<00:02:48.300> for<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> blanket<00:02:48.980> it's

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
on how many rows for a blanket it's

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.400 
on how many rows for a blanket it's
always<00:02:50.280> hard<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.520> say<00:02:50.730> because<00:02:51.000> again<00:02:51.630> those

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
always hard to say because again those

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.020 
always hard to say because again those
are<00:02:52.440> three<00:02:52.800> variables<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.460> have<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.700> look<00:02:53.850> at

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
are three variables we have to look at

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.200 
are three variables we have to look at
beyond<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.380> loom<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.920> what<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.910> want<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
beyond the loom and what you want the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.080 
beyond the loom and what you want the
blanket<00:02:57.360> designed<00:02:57.840> for
