00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hey people what is going to share and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.870
 Dominions come to this video I know 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.919
 again a fact theory video but up 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.790
 she stands still takes a bit longer 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.469
 Therefore, the question how much grams of protein 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.269
 I need and certainly question it 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.210
 Everyone is interested in this sport 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.869
 line you want exactly the amount of protein 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.420
 to take the ones you need around me 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.830
 quote jacko mass build and how 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.739
 this amount up to the third 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.760
 decimal point looks like that you will experience 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.430
 not in this video 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 no that does not exist is nonsense 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.000
 but what this video is or needs 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.110
 now I only give myself short ones 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.660
 answer even if I am already again 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 Two minutes have talked and that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.219
 I refer to the review review 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.949
 is a paper difference what several 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.110
 Studies takes and the comparison together 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.300
 that is to say, it is almost competing 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.600
 if the studies wanted to check that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.370
 chat gold jack in the description 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 spox there's the studies 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.010
 or what I refer to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.140
 and yes, it's easy as me 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.200
 if you want to take it you should 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.210
 Look at her 18 grams per kilogram 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 body weight of protein to guide the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.990
 means that you can be sure 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.470
 so that everything is covered and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.829
 then it is also good 18 grams and and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.729
 Cover it ready then if you 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.740
 wanted to lose 2.3 to 31 grams per 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.250
 kilogram of body not physically 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.950
 but remax that means fat-free 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 body mass 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.780
 why now when losing weight 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.829
 fat-free body mass 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.970
 if now weighs 150 kilograms and 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.340
 do not want to lose weight says the 3 gram 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.570
 body weight then eats the 450 grams 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.700
 protein that's nonsense 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.460
 that means here and now in distribution 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.869
 or the sales done because of it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.899
 These studies have also been carried out 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.490
 are that to take and here it is 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.860
 It's about strength athletes, that is you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.049
 are physically active runs 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.759
 weight training bodybuilding water as 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.770
 i to take that means for the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.440
 Muscle development it would be optimal if I 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.300
 to 18 grams 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.930
 kilogram of body weight comes because of that 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.100
 It is proven that too little protein 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 of course a bad effect 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.010
 The muscle has or good for the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.720
 muscle loss then putin is still for 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.050
 many body functions used and 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.350
 needed but this is not proved that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.900
 Now too much protein is harmful 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.090
 If you are now 25 for example 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.190
 grams per kilogram of body weight too 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.720
 leads because it is not that the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.970
 is bad that is down 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.250
 It can get bad and go 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.610
 It can not be bad at the top 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.530
 become 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.240
 But that means you have studies here 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.220
 led out that he found that 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.740
 approximately the optimum value is 8 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.440
 to take grams per kilo fish for 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.430
 the parents lose 2.3 to 3.1 grams 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.600
 per kilogram 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.430
 fred frith network further advantages why 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.930
 you might be here right up to the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.860
 he should not only screw proteins 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.420
 for the mass but also if use 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.350
 thermic effect still good look 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.230
 we already had that in one of the 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.400
 last videos that's the calories 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.780
 provides food digestion 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.290
 to be burned again 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.720
 it is between 20 and 35 in protein 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.000
 percent of the calories the protein has 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.709
 will also be there again 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.730
 digestion or metabolism 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.700
 that's what protein is needed for 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.070
 in coal occurred even 10 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.780
 that means there will be more calories here 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.550
 Consumed when using protein intake city 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.459
 carbohydrates 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.560
 alone in the digestion and then 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.019
 saturates putin even more that is if 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.370
 to get the terrestrial globe straight through protein 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.590
 has ever exchanged two good exchanges 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.769
 Advantages and there is a certainty 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.040
 lousy summer the thing or many 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:06.019
 At least that's how I got enough 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.430
 enough for the games and the certainty 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.410
 i just play a big role in that 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.620
 means you are safe on the way from 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.540
 but something with physical work and 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.000
 chastisement if you build up mass 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.500
 wanted in the sense of muscle mass if you 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.680
 wanted to lose weight and your muscle mass 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.330
 Mostly wanted to get that 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.099
 the numbers and otherwise 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.470
 this recommendation for one 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:31.939
 normal forks and what 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.569
 I know what reach a gram pro 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.699
 kilogram 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.219
 if you just just flare 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.240
 lives to himself or something like that 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.189
 we are not we are the 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.379
 athletes and therefore on the subject 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:44.270
 important grams of protein per kilogram 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.530
 I hope I do not 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.979
 help you until the next video 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.979
 take care
