you know very few people put on one bag

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.920 
you know very few people put on one bag
they<00:03:09.250> want<00:03:09.280> two<00:03:09.760> or<00:03:09.790> three<00:03:10.180> bags<00:03:10.389> in<00:03:10.750> their

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
they want two or three bags in their

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.800 
they want two or three bags in their
head<00:03:11.139> so<00:03:11.919> this<00:03:12.159> is<00:03:12.370> about<00:03:12.639> as<00:03:12.849> much<00:03:13.090> as<00:03:13.329> one<00:03:13.569> bag

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
head so this is about as much as one bag

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.220 
head so this is about as much as one bag
so<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.500> very<00:03:14.739> thin<00:03:15.189> so<00:03:15.939> if<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.510> want<00:03:16.780> thick

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
so it's very thin so if you want thick

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.550 
so it's very thin so if you want thick
hair<00:03:17.500> don't<00:03:18.159> buy<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.400> Chinese<00:03:19.060> virgin<00:03:19.750> light

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
hair don't buy the Chinese virgin light

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.390 
hair don't buy the Chinese virgin light
yaki

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
yaki

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.809 
yaki
I<00:03:21.599> think<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:23.199> thicker<00:03:23.470> one<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:24.010> probably<00:03:24.280> the

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
I think the thicker one is probably the

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.089 
I think the thicker one is probably the
Italian<00:03:25.479> yaki<00:03:26.019> because<00:03:26.260> that's<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.560> coarser

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
Italian yaki because that's a coarser

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.719 
Italian yaki because that's a coarser
here<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:28.109> didn't<00:03:29.109> want<00:03:29.139> coarser<00:03:29.919> but<00:03:30.519> maybe

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
here I didn't want coarser but maybe

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.479 
here I didn't want coarser but maybe
I'll<00:03:30.970> give<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.419> shot<00:03:31.690> next<00:03:32.109> time<00:03:32.489> not

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
I'll give it a shot next time not

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.699 
I'll give it a shot next time not
because<00:03:33.699> I<00:03:33.819> want<00:03:34.090> more<00:03:34.299> hair<00:03:34.629> that's<00:03:35.530> a

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
because I want more hair that's a

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.059 
because I want more hair that's a
negative<00:03:36.129> also<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.449> can<00:03:37.720> see<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.530> do<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:39.040> a

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
negative also you can see I do have a

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.500 
negative also you can see I do have a
silk<00:03:39.459> top<00:03:39.699> you<00:03:39.909> can<00:03:40.120> see<00:03:40.389> the<00:03:40.419> part

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.100 

but<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.549> also<00:03:47.730> see<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:50.870> what<00:03:51.870> do<00:03:51.989> they

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
but you can also see the what do they

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.440 
but you can also see the what do they
call<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:53.400> know<00:03:53.549> they<00:03:53.970> almost<00:03:54.090> look<00:03:54.420> like

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
call it you know they almost look like

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.199 
call it you know they almost look like
hair<00:03:55.019> plugs<00:03:55.409> so<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> can<00:03:55.950> see<00:03:56.310> where<00:03:57.000> they've

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
hair plugs so you can see where they've

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.819 
hair plugs so you can see where they've
sewn<00:03:57.629> in<00:03:59.390> look<00:04:00.390> there<00:04:00.629> goes<00:04:00.810> my<00:04:00.989> computer<00:04:01.530> you

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
sewn in look there goes my computer you

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.530 
sewn in look there goes my computer you
can<00:04:02.010> see<00:04:02.220> where<00:04:02.400> they've<00:04:02.519> sewn<00:04:02.849> in<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.090> hair

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
can see where they've sewn in the hair

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.589 
can see where they've sewn in the hair
and<00:04:04.280> that's<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.459> whole<00:04:05.640> reason<00:04:05.670> for<00:04:06.090> getting

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
and that's the whole reason for getting

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.930 
and that's the whole reason for getting
a<00:04:06.690> silk<00:04:07.049> top<00:04:07.349> is<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.069> don't<00:04:08.310> want<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.700> see

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
a silk top is that you don't want to see

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.830 
a silk top is that you don't want to see
those<00:04:09.209> little<00:04:09.569> plugs<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.790> want<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.209> knots<00:04:12.450> to

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
those little plugs you want the knots to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.140 
those little plugs you want the knots to
be<00:04:13.140> seamless<00:04:14.099> like<00:04:14.340> it's<00:04:14.519> coming<00:04:14.879> out<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.030> your

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
be seamless like it's coming out of your

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.849 
be seamless like it's coming out of your
head<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.840> can't<00:04:16.079> really<00:04:16.199> see<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
head and you can't really see it that

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.729 
head and you can't really see it that
well<00:04:17.039> but<00:04:17.669> if<00:04:17.789> you<00:04:17.940> came<00:04:18.180> up<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.600> my<00:04:18.780> head<00:04:19.049> you

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
well but if you came up on my head you

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.640 
well but if you came up on my head you
could<00:04:19.949> see<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.519> knots<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.209> that's<00:04:21.930> with<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
could see the knots and that's with the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.700 
could see the knots and that's with the
silk<00:04:22.949> top<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.449> part<00:04:24.780> was<00:04:24.930> extremely

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
silk top so that part was extremely

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.800 
silk top so that part was extremely
frustrating<00:04:26.580> since<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.300> paid<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.720> extra

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
frustrating since I paid the extra

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.870 
frustrating since I paid the extra
thirty<00:04:28.289> dollars<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.250> still<00:04:29.550> see<00:04:29.580> the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
thirty dollars and you can still see the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.409 
thirty dollars and you can still see the
plugs<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:31.110> probably<00:04:31.740> better<00:04:32.180> than<00:04:33.180> not

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
plugs it's probably better than not

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.110 
plugs it's probably better than not
having<00:04:33.449> a<00:04:33.960> sub<00:04:34.229> top<00:04:34.470> at<00:04:34.680> all<00:04:34.830> but<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.729> wanted

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
having a sub top at all but I wanted

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.750 
having a sub top at all but I wanted
something<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:36.600> looked<00:04:36.780> amazing<00:04:37.280> I'm<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.520> paid

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
something that looked amazing I'm I paid

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.430 
something that looked amazing I'm I paid
close<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.060> three<00:04:39.449> hundred<00:04:39.570> dollars<00:04:39.780> for<00:04:40.320> this

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
close to three hundred dollars for this

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.159 
close to three hundred dollars for this
and<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:41.000> finally<00:04:42.000> thought<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.270> was<00:04:42.539> getting<00:04:42.930> what

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
and I finally thought I was getting what

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.080 
and I finally thought I was getting what
I<00:04:43.199> wanted<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:44.039> didn't<00:04:45.350> but<00:04:46.580> they<00:04:47.580> may<00:04:47.789> work

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
I wanted and I didn't but they may work

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.000 
I wanted and I didn't but they may work
with<00:04:48.330> me<00:04:48.539> I've<00:04:48.720> already<00:04:48.870> emailed<00:04:49.169> them<00:04:49.740> and

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
with me I've already emailed them and

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.710 
with me I've already emailed them and
asked<00:04:50.160> them<00:04:50.370> what<00:04:50.520> they<00:04:50.669> can<00:04:50.729> do<00:04:51.000> for<00:04:51.270> me<00:04:51.330> and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
asked them what they can do for me and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.089 
asked them what they can do for me and
we'll<00:04:51.900> see<00:04:52.620> what<00:04:52.800> happens<00:04:53.810> but<00:04:54.810> overall<00:04:55.530> I

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
we'll see what happens but overall I

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.000 
we'll see what happens but overall I
think<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.760> looks<00:04:56.940> extremely<00:04:57.240> natural<00:04:58.229> it's

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
think it looks extremely natural it's

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.689 
think it looks extremely natural it's
pretty<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:01.050> haven't<00:05:01.830> done<00:05:01.919> anything<00:05:02.280> with<00:05:02.490> it

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
pretty I haven't done anything with it

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.040 
pretty I haven't done anything with it
actually<00:05:03.360> did<00:05:03.630> take<00:05:03.930> some<00:05:05.270> shears<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.810> kind

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
actually did take some shears and kind

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.339 
actually did take some shears and kind
of<00:05:07.199> cut<00:05:07.410> it<00:05:07.560> like<00:05:07.680> this<00:05:07.949> in<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.310> front<00:05:09.229> but<00:05:10.229> you

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
of cut it like this in the front but you

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.560 
of cut it like this in the front but you
can't<00:05:10.590> really<00:05:10.800> tell<00:05:11.130> that<00:05:11.460> I've<00:05:12.419> done

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
can't really tell that I've done

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.270 
can't really tell that I've done
anything<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.770> I'll<00:05:13.889> probably<00:05:14.190> curl<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.330> and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
anything and I'll probably curl it and

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.460 
anything and I'll probably curl it and
you<00:05:17.280> know<00:05:17.400> add<00:05:17.639> something<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.260> make<00:05:19.440> it

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
you know add something to it to make it
