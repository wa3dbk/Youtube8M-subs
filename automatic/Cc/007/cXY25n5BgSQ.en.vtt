sure<00:03:05.570> they're<00:03:05.780> guys<00:03:05.989> who<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.650> then

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
sure they're guys who do it and then

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.460 
sure they're guys who do it and then
even<00:03:07.220> women<00:03:07.459> writers<00:03:08.239> who<00:03:08.600> do<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.900> who<00:03:09.019> can<00:03:09.200> sit

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
even women writers who do it who can sit

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.490 
even women writers who do it who can sit
down<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:10.220> think<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.880> visualize<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.900> see

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
down and think and visualize and see

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.910 
down and think and visualize and see
Atlanta<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.579> see<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.120> burning<00:03:14.420> sky<00:03:14.780> I'm<00:03:15.590> sure

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
Atlanta and see the burning sky I'm sure

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.150 
Atlanta and see the burning sky I'm sure
they<00:03:16.160> do

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
they do

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.220 
they do
-<00:03:19.610> but<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:20.970> when<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.480> continue<00:03:22.050> to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
- but I can think when you continue to

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.620 
- but I can think when you continue to
use<00:03:22.500> your<00:03:22.740> end<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.550> really<00:03:23.880> your<00:03:24.030> brain<00:03:24.270> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
use your end and you really your brain a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.630 
use your end and you really your brain a
lot<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.380> thinking<00:03:25.710> I<00:03:25.980> think<00:03:26.040> what<00:03:26.610> I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
lot of the thinking I think what I

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.280 
lot of the thinking I think what I
learned<00:03:26.820> about<00:03:26.970> thinking<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.900> takes

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
learned about thinking is this takes

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.130 
learned about thinking is this takes
place<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:29.130> maybe<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:30.000> your<00:03:30.180> subconscious<00:03:30.450> so

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
place here maybe in your subconscious so

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.670 
place here maybe in your subconscious so
if<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.320> keep<00:03:31.560> going<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:33.020> get<00:03:34.020> it<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.380> get<00:03:34.530> it

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
if you keep going you get it you get it

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.470 
if you keep going you get it you get it
out<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.250> eventually<00:03:35.550> you

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
out and you eventually you

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.330 
out and you eventually you
I<00:03:36.690> found<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.350> thought<00:03:37.710> oh<00:03:37.860> that's<00:03:38.100> what

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
I found that I thought oh that's what

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.740 
I found that I thought oh that's what
I'm<00:03:38.460> writing<00:03:38.580> about<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.150> was<00:03:39.270> able<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.570> go

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
I'm writing about and I was able to go

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.060 
I'm writing about and I was able to go
on<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.930> made<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.170> huge<00:03:43.260> difference<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.010> don't

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
on and it made a huge difference I don't

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.860 
on and it made a huge difference I don't
know<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:44.580> will<00:03:44.670> help<00:03:44.850> any<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:45.390> also

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
know if that will help any of you also

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.280 
know if that will help any of you also
there's<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.530> big<00:03:46.830> difference<00:03:47.130> between<00:03:48.290> when

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
there's a big difference between when

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.800 
there's a big difference between when
you<00:03:49.470> write<00:03:49.800> when<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.370> title<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.570> you're

you write when the title and you're
composing<00:03:52.260> at<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.130> keyboard<00:03:53.460> and<00:03:54.060> when<00:03:54.540> you

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
composing at a keyboard and when you

year<00:04:00.960> in<00:04:01.020> drama<00:04:01.260> school<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.920> had<00:04:02.400> decided<00:04:02.760> that

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
year in drama school I had decided that

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.080 
year in drama school I had decided that
my<00:04:03.600> brain<00:04:03.840> was<00:04:04.050> gonna<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:04.650> quick<00:04:04.980> now<00:04:05.310> that

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
my brain was gonna be so quick now that

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.720 
my brain was gonna be so quick now that
I<00:04:06.120> would<00:04:06.420> have<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.750> title<00:04:07.410> plays<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:08.430> order<00:04:08.640> to

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
I would have the title plays in order to

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.470 
I would have the title plays in order to
keep<00:04:08.940> up<00:04:09.210> with<00:04:09.390> my<00:04:09.600> quick<00:04:09.930> minute<00:04:10.350> characters

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
keep up with my quick minute characters

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.780 
keep up with my quick minute characters
well<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.510> didn't<00:04:12.930> get<00:04:13.080> shit<00:04:13.320> done

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
well I didn't get shit done

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.939 
well I didn't get shit done
I<00:04:14.819> realized<00:04:15.599> finally<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.350> had<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.650> go<00:04:16.799> back

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
I realized finally that I had to go back

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.860 
I realized finally that I had to go back
to<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> panel<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:17.790> went<00:04:17.970> back<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.329> pen<00:04:18.630> and

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
to a panel and I went back to a pen and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.479 
to a panel and I went back to a pen and
I<00:04:18.989> use<00:04:19.139> what<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.350> realized<00:04:19.769> it's<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.070> completely

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
I use what I realized it's a completely

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.640 
I use what I realized it's a completely
different<00:04:20.729> problem<00:04:21.299> if<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.199> find<00:04:22.500> yourself

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
different problem if you find yourself

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.590 
different problem if you find yourself
if<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.220> right<00:04:23.490> now<00:04:23.930> at<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.020> keyboard<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.880> and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
if you right now at a keyboard and and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.450 
if you right now at a keyboard and and
you<00:04:27.990> find<00:04:28.229> yourself<00:04:28.590> getting<00:04:28.710> stuck<00:04:29.160> you

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
you find yourself getting stuck you

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.850 
you find yourself getting stuck you
might<00:04:29.669> want<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:29.940> just<00:04:30.120> pick<00:04:30.330> up<00:04:30.479> a<00:04:30.600> pen<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.620> do

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
might want to just pick up a pen and do

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.240 
might want to just pick up a pen and do
that<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.830> finally<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.610> guess<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.800> reason<00:04:37.979> that

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
that and finally I guess the reason that

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.580 
that and finally I guess the reason that
I<00:04:38.400> wrote<00:04:38.639> this<00:04:38.820> book<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.330> because<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:40.139> felt<00:04:40.380> that
