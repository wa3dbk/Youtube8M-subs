bit<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.250> then<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.150> start<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:28.110> drop<00:04:28.410> them<00:04:28.740> into

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
bit and then you start to drop them into

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.210 
bit and then you start to drop them into
the<00:04:31.250> broth<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.900> broth<00:04:34.169> is<00:04:34.380> boiling<00:04:34.410> yes

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
the broth and the broth is boiling yes

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.860 
the broth and the broth is boiling yes
I'm<00:04:35.520> at<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.300> complete<00:04:36.419> boil<00:04:36.900> now<00:04:37.140> yes<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:38.870> as

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
I'm at a complete boil now yes and as

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.230 
I'm at a complete boil now yes and as
the<00:04:40.230> ball<00:04:40.530> slows<00:04:41.100> down<00:04:41.460> because<00:04:41.820> as<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.090> add

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
the ball slows down because as you add

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.230 
the ball slows down because as you add
these<00:04:42.480> dumplings<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.220> broth<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.910> ball<00:04:45.090> is

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
these dumplings to the broth the ball is

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.770 
these dumplings to the broth the ball is
going<00:04:45.390> too<00:04:45.510> slow<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:47.340> want<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.910> add<00:04:48.150> your

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
going too slow so you want to add your

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.840 
going too slow so you want to add your
dumplings<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.500> wherever<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:50.010> ball<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.760> I

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
dumplings to wherever that ball is and I

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.480 
dumplings to wherever that ball is and I
call<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.390> chasing<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.710> ball<00:04:52.919> around<00:04:53.220> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
call this chasing the ball around the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.159 
call this chasing the ball around the
pot<00:04:55.970> because<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.090> want<00:04:57.270> those<00:04:57.419> dumplings<00:04:57.930> to

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
pot because you want those dumplings to

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.620 
pot because you want those dumplings to
cook<00:04:58.700> pretty<00:04:59.700> quick<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:00.419> these<00:05:01.410> will<00:05:01.680> boil

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
cook pretty quick so these will boil

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.909 
cook pretty quick so these will boil
what<00:05:03.630> by<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:03.900> time<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.320> finish<00:05:04.590> this<00:05:04.710> whole

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.270 
I don't know that chicken and dumplings
is<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.180> good<00:05:22.480> dish<00:05:22.690> that<00:05:22.900> travels<00:05:23.320> well<00:05:23.500> it's

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
is a good dish that travels well it's

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.620 
is a good dish that travels well it's
something<00:05:24.640> that<00:05:25.000> has<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.240> be<00:05:26.010> pretty<00:05:27.010> much

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
something that has to be pretty much

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.940 
something that has to be pretty much
time<00:05:28.630> just<00:05:29.020> right<00:05:29.230> to<00:05:29.410> get<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.770> dinner

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
time just right to get to the dinner

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.520 
time just right to get to the dinner
table<00:05:30.340> in<00:05:30.460> order<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.790> be<00:05:30.910> eaten<00:05:31.600> when<00:05:32.200> it's<00:05:32.380> at

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
table in order to be eaten when it's at

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.370 
table in order to be eaten when it's at
its<00:05:32.560> best<00:05:32.770> because<00:05:33.670> they<00:05:34.300> will<00:05:34.600> absorb<00:05:34.840> if<00:05:35.290> you

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
its best because they will absorb if you

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.050 
its best because they will absorb if you
let<00:05:35.560> them<00:05:35.620> sit<00:05:35.860> for<00:05:35.920> a<00:05:36.100> while<00:05:36.280> they<00:05:36.490> will<00:05:36.730> start

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
let them sit for a while they will start

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.430 
let them sit for a while they will start
to<00:05:37.210> absorb<00:05:37.450> the<00:05:37.720> broth<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.200> they'll<00:05:38.320> become

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
to absorb the broth and they'll become

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.280 
to absorb the broth and they'll become
thick<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:39.240> puffy<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.420> you<00:05:40.870> don't<00:05:41.050> have<00:05:41.140> any

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
thick and puffy and you don't have any

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.160 
thick and puffy and you don't have any
of<00:05:41.350> that<00:05:41.380> good<00:05:41.650> broth<00:05:42.070> left<00:05:42.430> anymore<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.180> see

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
of that good broth left anymore and see

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.720 
of that good broth left anymore and see
it's<00:05:44.350> it's<00:05:44.650> a<00:05:44.830> dish<00:05:45.010> that<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.310> have<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.520> pretty

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
it's it's a dish that you have to pretty

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.220 
it's it's a dish that you have to pretty
much<00:05:45.880> time<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.480> get<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.840> dinner<00:05:46.990> table

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
much time to get to the dinner table

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.250 
much time to get to the dinner table
usually<00:05:47.590> within<00:05:48.190> at<00:05:48.820> least<00:05:49.300> 45<00:05:49.720> minutes<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:50.200> an

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
usually within at least 45 minutes to an

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.410 
usually within at least 45 minutes to an
hour<00:05:50.470> I<00:05:50.830> think<00:05:51.250> we've<00:05:51.610> got<00:05:51.790> them<00:05:51.940> in<00:05:52.030> there<00:05:52.240> now

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
hour I think we've got them in there now

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.720 
hour I think we've got them in there now
we<00:05:52.480> just<00:05:52.750> need<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.140> let<00:05:53.350> them<00:05:53.590> simmer<00:05:54.010> for

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
we just need to let them simmer for

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.780 
we just need to let them simmer for
about<00:05:55.260> 15<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.410> 20<00:05:56.740> minutes<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:57.190> then<00:05:57.280> we'll

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
about 15 to 20 minutes and then we'll

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.340 
about 15 to 20 minutes and then we'll
add<00:05:57.940> our<00:05:57.970> chicken<00:05:58.480> and<00:05:58.570> they'll<00:05:58.930> be<00:05:59.080> good<00:05:59.260> to

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
add our chicken and they'll be good to

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.010 
add our chicken and they'll be good to
go<00:05:59.500> and<00:05:59.920> now<00:06:00.850> we're<00:06:01.120> ready<00:06:01.240> for<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:01.630> final

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
go and now we're ready for the final

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.870 
go and now we're ready for the final
step<00:06:02.260> and<00:06:02.530> that's<00:06:02.680> adding<00:06:02.950> the<00:06:03.220> dump<00:06:03.610> the

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
step and that's adding the dump the

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.470 
step and that's adding the dump the
chicken<00:06:04.950> to<00:06:05.950> the<00:06:05.980> dumplings<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:08.650> we<00:06:08.800> just

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
chicken to the dumplings and we just

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.540 
chicken to the dumplings and we just
drop<00:06:10.480> it<00:06:10.510> down<00:06:10.870> in<00:06:11.080> there<00:06:11.320> are<00:06:12.160> you<00:06:12.280> still

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
drop it down in there are you still

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.400 
drop it down in there are you still
chasing<00:06:12.790> well<00:06:13.480> you're<00:06:13.600> doing<00:06:13.780> it<00:06:13.900> now<00:06:14.080> we

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
chasing well you're doing it now we

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.830 
chasing well you're doing it now we
don't<00:06:14.440> have<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.770> chase<00:06:15.010> this<00:06:15.280> time<00:06:15.520> right<00:06:16.060> but

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
don't have to chase this time right but

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.480 
don't have to chase this time right but
now<00:06:16.990> it<00:06:17.170> will<00:06:17.320> stop<00:06:17.680> boiling<00:06:17.950> because<00:06:18.370> we're

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
now it will stop boiling because we're

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.980 
now it will stop boiling because we're
putting<00:06:18.610> this<00:06:18.790> cold<00:06:19.030> chicken<00:06:19.270> in<00:06:19.480> here<00:06:19.660> so<00:06:19.840> it

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
putting this cold chicken in here so it

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.080 
putting this cold chicken in here so it
will<00:06:20.200> probably<00:06:20.770> stop<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.670> then<00:06:21.760> you<00:06:21.790> just

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
will probably stop and then you just

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.290
