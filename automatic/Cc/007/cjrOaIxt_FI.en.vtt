00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.860 

there<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.870> nice<00:00:34.969> very<00:00:35.969> nice

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
there we go nice very nice

there we go nice very nice
I<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> victories<00:00:38.040> you've<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.309> us

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I think to the victories you've got us

here stick that back there

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.940 
here stick that back there
the<00:00:41.879> moment<00:00:43.250> we<00:00:45.140> get<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.320> back<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> the

that removable at the actual battery box
moment<00:01:35.280> we'll<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.490> push<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:35.970> down

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180

and<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.380> teeth<00:01:37.909> nuts<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> could<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.210> worked

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and the teeth nuts you could have worked

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.620 
and the teeth nuts you could have worked
out<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:39.960> two<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:41.150> unloaded<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:42.479> on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
out are these two that unloaded down on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.149 
out are these two that unloaded down on
the<00:01:42.750> rod<00:01:44.630> giving<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.350> usually<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> bit

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the rod giving so those is usually a bit

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.289 
the rod giving so those is usually a bit
of<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> trick<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:47.909> need<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> use<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
of a trick you actually need to use a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
of a trick you actually need to use a
wrench<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.780> socket<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.290> usually<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.799> deep

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
wrench a socket it's usually not deep

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.350 
wrench a socket it's usually not deep
enough<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.149> fit<00:01:51.649> stop<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.759> rear

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
enough for it to fit stop there the rear

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
enough for it to fit stop there the rear
battery<00:01:55.159> ideally<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.820> make<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> jig

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
battery ideally you have a make up a jig

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.679 
battery ideally you have a make up a jig
something<00:01:57.840> similar<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.579> so<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.540> can

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
something similar to this so you can

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.940 
something similar to this so you can
bolt<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.290> battery<00:02:01.829> using<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.969> threaded<00:02:03.329> rod

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
bolt the battery using this threaded rod

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.510 
bolt the battery using this threaded rod
to<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.390> couple<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.450> bits<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:07.160> stainless<00:02:08.160> steel

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
to a couple of bits of stainless steel

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
to a couple of bits of stainless steel
or<00:02:09.090> anything<00:02:09.569> else<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:09.929> lying<00:02:10.229> around

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
or anything else you have lying around

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.650 
or anything else you have lying around
good<00:02:11.190> its<00:02:11.459> broad

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
good its broad

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.480 
good its broad
so<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.920> something<00:02:14.130> strong<00:02:14.460> to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
so that you can have something strong to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.760 
so that you can have something strong to
lift<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.910> from<00:02:15.140> rather<00:02:16.140> than<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.620> those

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
lift up from rather than just those

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.170 
lift up from rather than just those
little<00:02:17.570> screws<00:02:19.430> sorry<00:02:20.430> rather<00:02:20.730> those<00:02:20.910> little

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
little screws sorry rather those little

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.810 
little screws sorry rather those little
nuts<00:02:22.880> we<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.060> use<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.210> washer<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.930> some<00:02:25.820> think

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
nuts we just use a washer and some think

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.380 
nuts we just use a washer and some think
they<00:02:27.000> end<00:02:27.450> no<00:02:28.080> m8<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.610> same<00:02:29.820> ones<00:02:30.060> from

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
they end no m8 for the same ones from

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.100 
they end no m8 for the same ones from
the<00:02:30.510> battery<00:02:30.810> itself<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:31.980> case<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> m6

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
the battery itself in that case the m6

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.340 
the battery itself in that case the m6
nuts<00:02:35.480> again<00:02:36.480> hopefully<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:36.960> them<00:02:37.110> lying

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
nuts again hopefully you have them lying

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.160 
nuts again hopefully you have them lying
around<00:02:37.470> because<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:39.240> local<00:02:39.540> fast<00:02:39.780> no<00:02:39.960> place

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
around because the local fast no place

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.540 
around because the local fast no place
before<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.470> say<00:02:40.680> 100<00:02:41.040> inside<00:02:43.430> ideally<00:02:44.430> you'll

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
before I say 100 inside ideally you'll

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.250 
before I say 100 inside ideally you'll
do<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.000> black<00:02:45.180> plastic<00:02:45.540> cover<00:02:45.870> still

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
do it with the black plastic cover still

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.830 
do it with the black plastic cover still
on<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.060> you're<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.210> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.600> worry

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
on that way you're not going to worry

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
on that way you're not going to worry
too<00:02:48.930> much<00:02:49.110> about<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.770> live<00:02:50.370> terminals<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
too much about the live terminals and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.390 
too much about the live terminals and
everywhere<00:02:54.710> now<00:02:55.710> if<00:02:55.830> you've<00:02:55.950> got<00:02:55.980> an<00:02:56.130> engine

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
everywhere now if you've got an engine

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.440 
everywhere now if you've got an engine
hoist<00:02:56.640> or<00:02:56.820> something<00:02:57.090> similar

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
hoist or something similar

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.020 
hoist or something similar
I'd<00:02:58.230> use<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.920> lift<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.160> out<00:02:59.280> because<00:02:59.520> each

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I'd use that to lift it out because each

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.400 
I'd use that to lift it out because each
of<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.240> weighs<00:03:00.510> about<00:03:00.830> 60<00:03:01.830> kilos<00:03:06.290> not<00:03:07.290> sure

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
of these weighs about 60 kilos not sure

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.140 
of these weighs about 60 kilos not sure
how<00:03:07.800> much<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.220> pounds<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:08.880> believe

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
how much that is in pounds but believe

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:39.500 
how much that is in pounds but believe
me<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.450> heavy<00:03:29.510> now<00:03:36.740> this<00:03:37.740> guy's<00:03:37.980> gonna<00:03:38.760> set

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
me it's heavy now this guy's gonna set

00:03:39.510 --> 00:04:00.630 
me it's heavy now this guy's gonna set
up<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:40.200> Ventura

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.280 

this<00:04:01.640> day<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:01.910> make<00:04:02.180> sure<00:04:02.360> that<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:02.750> hasn't

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
this day to make sure that this hasn't

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:14.050 
this day to make sure that this hasn't
been<00:04:03.530> caught<00:04:03.770> because<00:04:04.069> it<00:04:12.970> doesn't<00:04:13.970> get

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
been caught because it doesn't get

00:04:14.060 --> 00:05:51.870 
been caught because it doesn't get
caught<00:04:31.210> in<00:04:32.210> the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.390 

good<00:05:52.930> once<00:05:53.930> you<00:05:54.020> get<00:05:54.139> three<00:05:54.410> modules<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:55.280> on

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
good once you get three modules and on

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.790 
good once you get three modules and on
the<00:05:55.490> floor<00:05:55.700> next<00:05:56.480> is<00:05:56.690> the<00:05:56.840> same<00:05:57.020> much<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.620> same

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
the floor next is the same much the same

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.629 
the floor next is the same much the same
thing<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.570> client<00:05:59.570> battery<00:06:00.010> now<00:06:01.010> if<00:06:01.340> you've

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
thing the client battery now if you've

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.230 
thing the client battery now if you've
got<00:06:01.850> a<00:06:02.000> centered<00:06:02.330> stance<00:06:02.650> I'll<00:06:04.090> try<00:06:05.090> and

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
got a centered stance I'll try and

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.490 
got a centered stance I'll try and
restrain<00:06:05.510> the<00:06:05.660> bike<00:06:05.810> so<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.110> doesn't<00:06:06.260> move

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
restrain the bike so that doesn't move

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.629 
restrain the bike so that doesn't move
when<00:06:06.710> you're<00:06:06.800> trying<00:06:06.950> to<00:06:07.070> drag<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:07.310> battery

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
when you're trying to drag the battery

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.760 
when you're trying to drag the battery
up<00:06:07.790> if<00:06:08.060> you're<00:06:08.210> on<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.389> side<00:06:08.570> stand<00:06:08.930> then<00:06:09.590> I

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
up if you're on the side stand then I

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.840 
up if you're on the side stand then I
definitely<00:06:10.220> restrain<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.669> bike<00:06:10.790> here

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
definitely restrain the bike here

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.870 
definitely restrain the bike here
basically<00:06:13.850> pointing<00:06:14.600> is<00:06:14.690> back<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:16.400> is<00:06:16.550> glued

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
basically pointing is back it is glued

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.909 
basically pointing is back it is glued
in<00:06:17.030> place<00:06:17.060> usually<00:06:17.720> there'll<00:06:18.410> be<00:06:18.470> silicon

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
in place usually there'll be silicon

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.909 
in place usually there'll be silicon
inserts<00:06:19.400> down<00:06:19.910> the<00:06:20.060> side<00:06:20.240> of<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.620> chassis

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
between the battery and chassis to hold

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.300 
between the battery and chassis to hold
it<00:06:23.630> there<00:06:23.780> with<00:06:23.960> friction<00:06:24.200> you've<00:06:25.070> gotta<00:06:25.190> have

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
it there with friction you've gotta have

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.159 
it there with friction you've gotta have
better<00:06:25.460> overcome<00:06:25.940> it<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:26.240> the<00:06:26.330> only<00:06:26.510> way<00:06:26.690> to

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
better overcome it and the only way to

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.240 
better overcome it and the only way to
do<00:06:27.260> that<00:06:27.290> is<00:06:27.560> really<00:06:27.830> through<00:06:28.190> brute<00:06:28.400> force<00:06:30.250> if

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
do that is really through brute force if

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.040 
do that is really through brute force if
you're<00:06:31.700> capable<00:06:31.850> of<00:06:32.090> brute<00:06:32.300> force<00:06:32.570> I'm<00:06:32.810> not

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
you're capable of brute force I'm not

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:44.200 
you're capable of brute force I'm not
really<00:06:42.460> again<00:06:43.460> you<00:06:43.610> have<00:06:43.729> another<00:06:43.760> temp

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
really again you have another temp

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.510 
really again you have another temp
sensor<00:06:44.539> board<00:06:44.780> it<00:06:44.930> back<00:06:45.169> here<00:06:45.410> if<00:06:46.039> you<00:06:46.220> want<00:06:46.460> to

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
sensor board it back here if you want to

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.770 
sensor board it back here if you want to
undo<00:06:46.850> it<00:06:46.970> before<00:06:47.060> you<00:06:47.300> doing<00:06:47.510> too<00:06:47.630> much

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
undo it before you doing too much

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.760 
undo it before you doing too much
trouble<00:06:49.960> exactly<00:06:50.960> the<00:06:51.169> same<00:06:51.320> connector<00:06:51.680> is

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
trouble exactly the same connector is

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.170 
trouble exactly the same connector is
the<00:06:51.890> front<00:06:52.100> one<00:06:53.350> righty<00:06:54.789> then<00:06:55.789> you<00:06:55.940> basically

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
the front one righty then you basically

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.520 
the front one righty then you basically
get<00:06:56.360> it<00:06:56.479> out<00:06:56.570> in<00:06:56.690> the<00:06:56.780> same<00:06:56.990> means

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
get it out in the same means

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.140 
get it out in the same means
luckily<00:06:58.010> the<00:06:58.250> front<00:06:58.460> battery<00:06:58.820> is<00:06:58.880> a<00:06:58.940> bit

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
luckily the front battery is a bit

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.260 
luckily the front battery is a bit
lighter<00:06:59.419> than<00:06:59.630> the<00:06:59.690> rear<00:06:59.930> one<00:07:01.000> but<00:07:02.000> it's<00:07:02.150> still

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
lighter than the rear one but it's still

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:23.780 
lighter than the rear one but it's still
heavy<00:07:02.510> as<00:07:02.690> hell

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:45.820 

all<00:07:24.790> right
