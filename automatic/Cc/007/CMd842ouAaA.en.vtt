00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.680
 on my hair but you will see it calmly 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.970
 nothing too shocking 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 But I know I stay tuned now I start 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.369
 a jar of milk flakes that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.009
 they seem few but they are only that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.360
 powerful nothing I am just like that 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.270
 sprawled on the ragona flowers bed 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.119
 before the elevator has changed 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.950
 and I started another generation 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.720

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.350
 concerns at what time they make me a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 collar 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.890

 I liked the 100 as I am again 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:50.290
 now I'll tell you an anecdote because in 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:52.960
 the practice of telling it is worse, that is 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.880
 these glasses are new glasses 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.880
 cloths because they are the rio as interests 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.150

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.080
 different from all the rest of your own 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.860
 you've seen so far though 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.600
 unfortunately while he was editing the blog 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.410
 last night the computer has me 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.570
 completely brushed and has me 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.250
 eliminated the last files so nothing 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.160
 the blog has been interrupted in a way 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.750
 terrible and I didn't feel like leaving it 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.690
 so therefore I say to you that I had resumed 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.960
 while the best friend came with 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.030
 the boy and then nothing we ate 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.940
 pizza while looking a little big 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.520
 brother 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.800
 we cooked the poletti we have so 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.160
 you risk setting another home on fire 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.160
 time 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.600
 after which time they watched friends 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.060
 bar the game I fell asleep 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.850
 wearing maggie who would be mine 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.700
 boy who calls himself long but then first 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.289
 or then make a boyfriend tag so you 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.750
 I will explain everything because every time 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.430
 I'm talking about someone, I see that it is 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.400
 difficult to understand with all sti 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.690
 nicknames however he was saying e in 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.510
 measure more at home 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.630
 as always forces do too many 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.479
 too many things and therefore nothing is 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.889

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.590

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:07.460
