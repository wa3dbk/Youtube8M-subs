00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.200
 After all, all of my rich here bloomed 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.649
 color rose on video you and care 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.649
 I'm afraid 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.290
 in many sources 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 they say she is very difficult to care 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.990
 she needs something but north herself 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.110
 can no longer be south 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.120
 direct sunlight is loved almost everywhere 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.940
 but she got accustomed and proves 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.370
 the reverse of the monarchy years are learning vandas i am her 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.829
 took the assessment she had very much 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.040
 confused now these leaves are insane you can 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.830
 on now a network of wrinkles ears passes 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.350
 one sheet climbs out the second sheet and very 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.130
 a lot of roots resumed now I tell you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.300
 I will show that 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.650
 meaning by renewal water 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.290
 renewed and rooted 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:05.420
 that is, from one root it climbs 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.620
 big ones these were all roots in 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.050
 terrible condition 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.930
 here, too, you can see that these 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.470
 all the bumps 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.470
 here 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.540
 just about new across the orchid notice 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.140
 this can be everywhere and at many tips 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:31.600
 root tips 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:40.030
 this is also evident here salt deposited me 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:44.840
 Now it wants to take the focus here in 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.350
 confusion go a lot of renewed 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.110
 the roots 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.240
 but as I see flower stalks nowhere else 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:56.000
 observed but it is better to let me 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:58.910
 honestly grows up is very simple 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.509
 what is know everyday care 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:07.880
 is that we need to 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:12.320
 our wang was wetted was 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.220
 moistened in the root system that is and 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.510
 I take the usual 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.280
 sprayer get rid of air or 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.190
 there is pumping pressure I do not know what's there 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.190
 affairs and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.890
 I spray pore no I usually do in the evening 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.350
 since i'm shooting a video like this 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.890
 scattered on one side and never plague 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.890
 hook 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.780
 here it is moistened to me on its walls 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.170
 a favorable environment is formed 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.070
 which makes a definite 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.910
 its habitat is watered and filled 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.900
 and to finish my gift was in which 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 is vanda 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.040
 add her favorite fertilizer for 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.090
 Phalaenopsis but also great for 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:13.780
 vandy this is not worth us for 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:16.209
 o'clock and yes my archive is on 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.459
 north window at me like that 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.680
 the sun's rays are far from direct and 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.680
 the lamp is not on for her now 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.940
 because light is a normal line i 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.040
 use this lamp I have it 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.100
 running somewhere to ten to eleven 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.340
 pm then later it turned off and 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.959
 they have a rest 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.260
 before it starts to go 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.650
 the sun and there will no longer be light yet 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.170
 ok that's these basic principles 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.269
 Wanda care nothing complicated, I do not 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.670
 I see how we will bring me down I 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.220
 I will definitely demonstrate to you 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:04.750
 my vanda feels great and 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:07.299
 I bought it for $ 30 yes for $ 30 I remember 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.110
 not afraid because there discount 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:15.550
 minus 20 percent here so we don't 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.550
 grows chic 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.960
 thank you all so much for watching you 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:28.270
 very love and do not be afraid to care for 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.630
 vandy is very easy to care for 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.550
 I love the flower soon I will go for 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.960
 another gang like i'll go to you 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.400
 Be sure to show the principles of buying something 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.830
 there is what it should be 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.570
 so that you still have strength and 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.070
 grow because we have vandy 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.870
 quite expensive with flowers 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:56.230
 well we will have there from 70 dollars somewhere 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.120
 initial price with wanda views 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.770
 perfect root system but this is you 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.480
 know find the perfect root system 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.610
 and beautiful flowers 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.890
 this is very problematic because they 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.290
 all bases are sold all the roots are black 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.110
 they obviously don't spray in the store in 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.710
 the store is pretty cool on these 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.669
 shelves and on this rubber qin perfect 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.460
 conditions for vanda 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.390
 so you buy Nina function 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.580
 vandy 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.620
 as I took but you can achieve an increase 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.260
 root system hereafter lush 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.260
 bloom all thank you bye bye
