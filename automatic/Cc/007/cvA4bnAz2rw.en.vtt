00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
there's only so much tech but I'm

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
there's only so much tech but I'm
actually<00:01:48.270> allowed<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.960> talk<00:01:49.200> about<00:01:49.470> here

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
actually allowed to talk about here

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170

not<00:01:54.720> gonna<00:01:54.960> worry<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> man<00:01:55.710> by<00:01:55.829> asking<00:01:56.100> too

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
not gonna worry the man by asking too

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.469 
not gonna worry the man by asking too
much<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.610> happening<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.090> quality<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
much about it happening that quality of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.330 
much about it happening that quality of
the<00:01:57.570> terms<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:58.079> they<00:01:58.290> beautiful<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the terms are they beautiful and the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.480 
the terms are they beautiful and the
thickness<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.180> tinsel<00:02:00.840> wires<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.140> this

big<00:02:02.490> voice<00:02:02.640> coil<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.869> seen<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
big voice coil I have seen the the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560 
big voice coil I have seen the the

enough<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> able<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.170> much<00:02:07.290> about<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
enough to be able to know much about it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.660 
enough to be able to know much about it
but<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.740> can't<00:02:07.770> tell<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> weight<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
but I can't tell you that the weight of

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.240 
but I can't tell you that the weight of
this<00:02:08.929> versus<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> way<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.160> as

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this versus the way to this it's not as

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 
this versus the way to this it's not as
much<00:02:11.400> difference<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.910> people<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.300> all<00:02:12.540> your

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
much difference as people think all your

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.080 
much difference as people think all your
dime

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090

like<00:02:13.360> wait<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.629> this<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.900> about<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.610> profile

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
like wait but this is about the profile

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.660 
like wait but this is about the profile
check<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.810> thing<00:02:16.870> out<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.650> gather<00:02:18.489> that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
check this thing out now I gather that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.850 
check this thing out now I gather that
your<00:02:18.959> design<00:02:19.959> intent<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:20.470> for<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.769> go

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
your design intent is for this to go

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.250 
your design intent is for this to go
into<00:02:21.069> more<00:02:21.390> european-style<00:02:22.390> skinnier<00:02:22.989> car

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
into more european-style skinnier car

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.290 
into more european-style skinnier car
installation<00:02:23.769> exactly<00:02:24.400> that's<00:02:24.849> one<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.239> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
installation exactly that's one of the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.509 
installation exactly that's one of the
reason<00:02:25.599> for<00:02:25.780> working<00:02:26.590> hard<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.950> develop<00:02:27.129> the

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
reason for working hard to develop the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.630 
reason for working hard to develop the
rear<00:02:27.819> Damle<00:02:28.470> material<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.769> make<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.129> very

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
rear Damle material to make this very

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.820 
rear Damle material to make this very
very<00:02:30.730> shallow<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.840> how<00:02:32.349> many<00:02:32.500> years<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:32.769> you

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
very shallow and how many years have you

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.740 
very shallow and how many years have you
spent<00:02:33.099> horan<00:02:33.610> day<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:33.879> this<00:02:34.000> based<00:02:34.180> basically

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
spent horan day on this based basically

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.920 
spent horan day on this based basically
on<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.640> magnet<00:02:36.640> itself<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.269> took<00:02:37.450> about<00:02:37.599> three

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
on the magnet itself it took about three

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.240 
on the magnet itself it took about three
and<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.110> half<00:02:38.140> years<00:02:38.530> before<00:02:38.739> we<00:02:39.040> had<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and a half years before we had the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.979 
and a half years before we had the
prototype<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.940> all<00:02:40.150> agree<00:02:40.450> where<00:02:40.660> every<00:02:40.930> other

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
prototype to all agree where every other

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.949 
prototype to all agree where every other
night<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.440> yeah<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.250> another<00:02:43.000> year<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.720> took

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
night it yeah and another year it took

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.800 
night it yeah and another year it took
to<00:02:44.200> come<00:02:45.190> up<00:02:45.340> with<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> core<00:02:45.790> material<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
to come up with a core material and the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.140 
to come up with a core material and the
layer<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.349> cones<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.400> put<00:02:48.579> together<00:02:48.700> it's

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
layer of cones we have put together it's

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.440 
layer of cones we have put together it's
a<00:02:49.239> dual<00:02:49.420> layer<00:02:50.130> thinner<00:02:51.130> layer<00:02:51.430> behind<00:02:51.670> to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
a dual layer thinner layer behind to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.059 
a dual layer thinner layer behind to
spool<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.870> out<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.200> response<00:02:53.620> instead<00:02:53.950> of

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
spool and out the response instead of

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.339 
spool and out the response instead of
going<00:02:54.340> into<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.819> treatment<00:02:55.209> yes<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.079> have<00:02:56.230> on

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
going into a treatment yes we have on

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.539 
going into a treatment yes we have on
the<00:02:56.410> other<00:02:56.650> driver<00:02:57.069> because<00:02:57.310> they're<00:02:57.430> all

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
the other driver because they're all

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.830 
the other driver because they're all
they're<00:02:57.790> all<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:58.060> surface<00:02:58.480> treat<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
they're all like surface treat to the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.509 
they're all like surface treat to the
cantata

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
cantata

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.520 
cantata
so<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:00.819> has<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> layer<00:03:01.629> of<00:03:01.840> consum<00:03:02.349> and

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
so this one has a layer of consum and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.890 
so this one has a layer of consum and
laminated<00:03:03.040> together<00:03:03.160> one<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.420> creates<00:03:04.750> an

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
laminated together one it creates an

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.699 
laminated together one it creates an
extremely<00:03:05.709> strong<00:03:06.750> material<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.560> you're

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
extremely strong material so you're

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.780 
extremely strong material so you're
getting<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:08.980> piss<00:03:09.220> tonic

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
getting that piss tonic
