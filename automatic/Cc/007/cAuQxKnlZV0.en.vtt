00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.869 
couple years ago I bleached my hair
white<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.889> as<00:03:47.009> you<00:03:47.099> can<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.250> my<00:03:47.519> natural<00:03:47.790> hair

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
white and as you can see my natural hair

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.309 
white and as you can see my natural hair
colors<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.419> really<00:03:48.750> really<00:03:48.900> really<00:03:48.989> dark

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
colors really really really really dark

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.469 
colors really really really really dark
and<00:03:49.590> all<00:03:50.400> my<00:03:50.489> hair<00:03:50.639> back<00:03:50.729> off<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:51.359> I<00:03:51.449> was

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
and all my hair back off and I was

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.629 
and all my hair back off and I was
pretty<00:03:51.900> sure<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.620> was<00:03:52.889> going<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.189> be<00:03:53.250> bald

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
pretty sure I was going to be bald

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.610 
pretty sure I was going to be bald
because<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.479> bleach<00:03:54.659> was<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:54.959> strong<00:03:55.319> on<00:03:55.530> my

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
because the bleach was so strong on my

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.770 
because the bleach was so strong on my
scalp<00:03:56.009> then<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.819> wasn't<00:03:57.180> sure<00:03:57.239> if<00:03:57.299> my<00:03:57.479> hair<00:03:57.750> was

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
scalp then I wasn't sure if my hair was

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.289 
scalp then I wasn't sure if my hair was
ever<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.259> grow<00:03:58.319> back<00:03:59.120> that's<00:04:00.120> when

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
ever going to grow back that's when

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.939 
ever going to grow back that's when
someone<00:04:00.599> showed<00:04:00.810> me<00:04:01.079> with<00:04:01.500> me<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
someone showed me with me the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.890 
someone showed me with me the
information<00:04:02.280> about<00:04:02.699> dusting<00:04:03.180> how<00:04:03.419> just<00:04:03.780> to

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
information about dusting how just to

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.280 
information about dusting how just to
keep<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.199> clean<00:04:04.409> and<00:04:05.239> just<00:04:06.239> basically<00:04:06.780> let<00:04:07.199> it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
keep it clean and just basically let it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.270 
keep it clean and just basically let it
all<00:04:07.379> happen<00:04:07.590> naturally<00:04:08.419> um<00:04:09.419> in<00:04:09.959> my<00:04:10.859> experience

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
all happen naturally um in my experience

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.300 
all happen naturally um in my experience
I<00:04:12.090> genuinely<00:04:12.689> believe<00:04:13.349> my<00:04:13.560> hair<00:04:13.739> grew<00:04:13.889> faster

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
I genuinely believe my hair grew faster

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.539 
I genuinely believe my hair grew faster
I<00:04:14.549> don't<00:04:15.150> know<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.359> it's<00:04:15.479> possible<00:04:15.599> again

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
I don't know if it's possible again

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.069 
I don't know if it's possible again
dusting<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.669> in<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.239> theory<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.599> making<00:04:19.019> your

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
dusting is in the theory of making your

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.509 
dusting is in the theory of making your
hair<00:04:19.229> grow<00:04:19.349> faster<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.799> not<00:04:19.949> scientifically

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
hair grow faster is not scientifically

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.039 
hair grow faster is not scientifically
proven<00:04:20.969> but<00:04:21.359> nowhere<00:04:21.599> is<00:04:21.719> it<00:04:21.779> not

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
proven but nowhere is it not

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.610 
proven but nowhere is it not
scientifically<00:04:22.680> proven<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:24.469> over<00:04:25.469> the<00:04:25.590> next

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
scientifically proven so over the next

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.660 
scientifically proven so over the next
like<00:04:25.949> two<00:04:26.219> years

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
like two years

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.990 
like two years
my<00:04:26.820> hair<00:04:27.030> was<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.800> fast<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.100> beautiful<00:04:29.760> and

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
my hair was so fast and beautiful and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.780 
my hair was so fast and beautiful and
long<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.600> finally<00:04:31.110> those<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:32.070> last<00:04:32.310> inch<00:04:32.610> of

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
long and finally those the last inch of

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.580 
long and finally those the last inch of
blonde<00:04:33.030> hair<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.270> had<00:04:33.480> on<00:04:33.630> my<00:04:33.660> head<00:04:33.960> had<00:04:34.560> been

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
blonde hair I had on my head had been

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.190 
blonde hair I had on my head had been
cut<00:04:35.010> off<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.550> my<00:04:35.970> hair<00:04:36.270> was<00:04:36.660> back<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.170> normal

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
cut off and my hair was back to normal

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.560 
cut off and my hair was back to normal
and<00:04:37.680> at<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.730> time<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:38.940> wasn't<00:04:39.180> sure<00:04:39.420> if<00:04:39.510> that

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
and at the time I wasn't sure if that

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.500 
and at the time I wasn't sure if that
was<00:04:39.690> ever<00:04:39.870> going<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.140> be<00:04:40.230> possible<00:04:40.380> for<00:04:40.860> me<00:04:41.510> so

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
was ever going to be possible for me so

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.420 
was ever going to be possible for me so
I<00:04:42.870> don't<00:04:43.290> know<00:04:43.470> if<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.740> really<00:04:43.770> does<00:04:44.130> make<00:04:44.280> your

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
I don't know if it really does make your

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.960 
I don't know if it really does make your
hair<00:04:44.580> grow<00:04:44.610> or<00:04:44.850> not<00:04:46.100> but<00:04:47.100> in<00:04:47.400> my<00:04:47.790> experience

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
hair grow or not but in my experience

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.570 
hair grow or not but in my experience
it's<00:04:48.750> made<00:04:48.960> my<00:04:49.110> hair<00:04:49.320> amazing<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.370> hand

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
it's made my hair amazing and the hand

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.510 
it's made my hair amazing and the hand
pull<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:51.030> handful<00:04:51.480> of<00:04:51.540> people<00:04:51.990> who<00:04:52.740> have<00:04:53.040> asked

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
pull a handful of people who have asked

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.480 
pull a handful of people who have asked
me<00:04:53.640> for<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.150> who<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.360> done<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.950> have<00:04:55.950> had

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490

me for it and who have done it have had
amazing<00:04:56.610> results<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:58.590> maybe<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.550> is

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
amazing results and maybe this is

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.830 
amazing results and maybe this is
because<00:04:59.910> they<00:05:00.060> start<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.330> like<00:05:00.480> their<00:05:00.660> hair<00:05:00.810> I

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
faster because it doesn't really make

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.430 
faster because it doesn't really make
your<00:05:25.590> hair<00:05:25.800> grow<00:05:25.830> faster<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:27.300> was<00:05:28.290> wrong
