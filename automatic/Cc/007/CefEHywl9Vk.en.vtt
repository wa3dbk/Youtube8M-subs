mobility<00:00:17.210> so<00:00:17.660> taking<00:00:17.930> a<00:00:17.990> closer<00:00:18.200> look<00:00:18.320> here<00:00:18.620> at

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
mobility so taking a closer look here at

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.530 
mobility so taking a closer look here at
the<00:00:18.800> project<00:00:19.010> shoulder<00:00:19.460> pad<00:00:19.670> starting<00:00:20.390> out

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
the project shoulder pad starting out

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.850 
the project shoulder pad starting out
the<00:00:20.630> design<00:00:20.930> and<00:00:21.140> it's<00:00:21.230> something<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:21.590> really

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
the design and it's something I really

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.530 
the design and it's something I really
like<00:00:22.040> about<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:22.370> shoulder<00:00:22.670> pad<00:00:22.850> is<00:00:23.030> they<00:00:23.390> did

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
like about the shoulder pad is they did

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.630 
like about the shoulder pad is they did
a<00:00:23.570> multi<00:00:23.990> panel<00:00:24.290> design<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:24.860> each<00:00:25.070> panel<00:00:25.490> is

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
a multi panel design so each panel is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.550 
a multi panel design so each panel is
gonna<00:00:26.030> move<00:00:26.360> separately<00:00:26.900> from<00:00:27.200> each<00:00:27.350> other

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
gonna move separately from each other

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.140 
gonna move separately from each other
and<00:00:27.800> they're<00:00:28.160> connected<00:00:28.610> with<00:00:28.760> stretch

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
and they're connected with stretch

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.049 
and they're connected with stretch
gussets<00:00:29.690> and<00:00:30.310> elastic<00:00:31.310> bands<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:31.700> it's<00:00:31.850> really

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
gussets and elastic bands so it's really

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.430 
gussets and elastic bands so it's really
gonna<00:00:32.210> allow<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.660> shoulder<00:00:32.989> pad<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.260> move

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
gonna allow the shoulder pad to move

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.829 
gonna allow the shoulder pad to move
with<00:00:33.679> their<00:00:33.890> body<00:00:34.129> so<00:00:34.670> it's<00:00:34.999> gonna<00:00:35.149> retain<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
with their body so it's gonna retain the

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.509 
with their body so it's gonna retain the
coverage<00:00:36.140> that<00:00:36.289> you<00:00:36.440> need<00:00:36.649> without<00:00:36.829> slipping

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
coverage that you need without slipping

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.270 
coverage that you need without slipping
and<00:00:37.609> flopping<00:00:37.999> around<00:00:38.949> moving<00:00:39.949> on<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:40.190> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
and flopping around moving on to the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.040 
and flopping around moving on to the
protection<00:00:40.789> now<00:00:40.909> they're<00:00:41.749> doing<00:00:41.929> what

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
protection now they're doing what

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.020 
protection now they're doing what
warriors<00:00:42.379> calling<00:00:42.739> out<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.159> their<00:00:43.370> 50/50

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
warriors calling out is their 50/50

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.790 
warriors calling out is their 50/50
protective<00:00:44.510> technology<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:45.649> they're

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
protective technology so they're

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.770 
protective technology so they're
strategically<00:00:46.039> placing<00:00:46.789> lightweight

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780

moving<00:01:27.560> on<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.890> shoulder<00:01:28.159> cap<00:01:28.369> now<00:01:28.549> as<00:01:29.210> you

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
moving on to the shoulder cap now as you

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.179 
moving on to the shoulder cap now as you
can<00:01:29.450> see<00:01:29.570> they<00:01:29.689> did<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.840> nice<00:01:30.049> low<00:01:30.740> profile

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
can see they did a nice low profile

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.249 
can see they did a nice low profile
shoulder<00:01:31.579> cap<00:01:31.789> and<00:01:32.600> what<00:01:32.840> they<00:01:32.930> did<00:01:33.109> is<00:01:33.229> they

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
shoulder cap and what they did is they

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.560 
shoulder cap and what they did is they
fused<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.950> layer<00:01:34.189> of<00:01:34.490> low<00:01:34.670> density<00:01:34.820> foam<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
fused a layer of low density foam to the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.060 
fused a layer of low density foam to the
outside<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.140> cap<00:01:36.289> so<00:01:36.530> it's<00:01:36.649> really<00:01:36.859> gonna

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
outside of the cap so it's really gonna

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.950 
outside of the cap so it's really gonna
protect<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.820> as<00:01:38.000> well<00:01:38.479> as<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.630> other<00:01:38.780> guys
