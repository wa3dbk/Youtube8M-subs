00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
tournament for you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420 
tournament for you
success<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.710> us<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> first

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
success well I think for us is the first

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.399 
success well I think for us is the first
time<00:01:23.640> after<00:01:23.939> 12<00:01:24.210> years<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.689> back<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
time after 12 years we are back here so

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
time after 12 years we are back here so
I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> stay<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> feet<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
I think we have to stay with the feet on

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
I think we have to stay with the feet on
the<00:01:27.270> ground<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:27.990> try<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> pause<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the ground and then try to pause the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.179 
the ground and then try to pause the
group<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.570> are<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> next

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
group and then if we are in the next

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.580 
group and then if we are in the next
round<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.119> already<00:01:33.420> good<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
round then is already good I think and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
round then is already good I think and
everything<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.159> comes<00:01:35.400> after<00:01:35.549> qualifying<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
everything that comes after qualifying a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.929 
everything that comes after qualifying a
lot<00:01:36.659> more<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> success<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.729> reach

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
lot more this is a success if we reach

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
lot more this is a success if we reach
our<00:01:39.240> goal<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.170> positive<00:01:40.710> group<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
our goal is I think positive group and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.469 
our goal is I think positive group and
then<00:01:41.250> maybe<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.790> lose<00:01:41.939> against<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> better

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
then maybe you lose against a better

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.749 
then maybe you lose against a better
team<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.280> achieve<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
team and I get that then we achieve of

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.170 
team and I get that then we achieve of
all<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.770> success<00:01:46.770> would<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.130> water<00:01:47.729> final

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
all but the success would be water final

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
all but the success would be water final
or<00:01:48.240> more<00:01:48.530> terrified<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.649> wherever<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.070> do

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
or more terrified that wherever you do

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
or more terrified that wherever you do
play<00:01:50.640> next<00:01:50.850> season<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.210> would<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.600> be

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
play next season you would have to be

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
play next season you would have to be
number<00:01:51.960> one

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
number one

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.240 
number one
yes<00:01:53.760> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:54.690> age<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.260> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
yes I think with my age and the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.210 
yes I think with my age and the
performances<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.480> had<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.870> think<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:59.160> to

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
performances I had I think I want to

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.460 
performances I had I think I want to
play<00:01:59.400> it's<00:01:59.640> obvious<00:01:59.940> that<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.260> on<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
play it's obvious that the to be on the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.040 
play it's obvious that the to be on the
bench<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.190> nicest<00:02:02.670> thing<00:02:02.910> so<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:04.020> I

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
bench is not the nicest thing so then I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.340 
bench is not the nicest thing so then I
read<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.270> quite<00:02:06.270> capable<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.630> mean<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.960> lay<00:02:07.080> out

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
read it quite capable I mean you lay out

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.889 
read it quite capable I mean you lay out
to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> side<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.100> Pelican<00:02:08.460> as<00:02:08.610> well<00:02:08.789> yes<00:02:09.570> it's

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
to the side to Pelican as well yes it's

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.990 
to the side to Pelican as well yes it's
true<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.550> unites<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.640> great<00:02:11.820> goalkeeper

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
true I think unites a great goalkeeper

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
true I think unites a great goalkeeper
where<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> wonderful<00:02:13.260> citizen<00:02:13.530> would

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
where the wonderful citizen would

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.310 
where the wonderful citizen would
Liverpool<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.420> end<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.720> lost<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.290> title

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
Liverpool on the end they lost the title

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.410 
Liverpool on the end they lost the title
but<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.250> he<00:02:17.400> had<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> great<00:02:17.820> season<00:02:18.120> he's<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
but I think he had a great season he's a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.480 
but I think he had a great season he's a
very<00:02:18.750> good<00:02:18.959> goalkeeper<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.590> every<00:02:20.250> training

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
very good goalkeeper so every training

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.910 
very good goalkeeper so every training
is<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.180> good<00:02:21.480> training<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:22.020> him<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.620> we

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
is a good training with him and and we

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.810 
is a good training with him and and we
pushed<00:02:23.310> each<00:02:23.490> other<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.630> better
