by<00:00:49.559> hand<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.280> such<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> small<00:00:50.730> plot

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
by hand because it is such a small plot

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.930 
by hand because it is such a small plot
but<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:52.379> started<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.760> my

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but i started going at it with my

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.529 
but i started going at it with my
pitchfork<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.190> realized<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.390> not

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
pitchfork and realized that this is not

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.000 
pitchfork and realized that this is not
going<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:57.899> well<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.649> take<00:00:58.829> me<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
going very well it's going to take me a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.500 
going very well it's going to take me a
very<00:00:59.219> long<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.699> i'm<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.359> very

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
very long time and i'm going to be very

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.110 
very long time and i'm going to be very
sore<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.140> done<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.940> figured<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
sore when I'm done I figured what I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.429 
sore when I'm done I figured what I
needed<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:03.690> leverage<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
needed was a little leverage on the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.520 
needed was a little leverage on the
handle<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.309> took<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> metal<00:01:06.210> bar<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
handle so I just took a metal bar and I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
handle so I just took a metal bar and I
wrapped<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> handle<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
wrapped it to the handle so that I had a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.010 
wrapped it to the handle so that I had a
little<00:01:09.540> leverage<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.500> twist<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:12.020> pitchfork

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
little leverage to twist the pitchfork

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.130 
little leverage to twist the pitchfork
with<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.909> after<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> did<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> took<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:15.990> about

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
with and after I did that took me about

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.600 
with and after I did that took me about
20<00:01:16.500> minutes<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.830> finish<00:01:17.070> tilling<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> garden

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
20 minutes to finish tilling the garden

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600 
20 minutes to finish tilling the garden
really<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.689> worked<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.110> very<00:01:19.140> well<00:01:19.610> after

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
really really worked out very well after

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.640 
really really worked out very well after
I<00:01:20.640> after<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> tilled<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> garden<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.350> spread

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I after I tilled the garden I spread

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
I after I tilled the garden I spread
some<00:01:22.880> spread<00:01:23.880> some<00:01:24.060> lime<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> some

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
some spread some lime and some

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
some spread some lime and some

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
fertilizer across the top with a Scots

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.440 
fertilizer across the top with a Scots
hand<00:01:27.570> spreader<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.939> that<00:01:29.939> holds<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
hand spreader and that holds about a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.300 
hand spreader and that holds about a
gallon<00:01:30.689> each<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.409> each<00:01:31.710> time<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.100> fill

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
hose this year I'm not doing the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.290

overhead<00:02:06.570> sprinkler<00:02:07.110> mechanism<00:02:08.300> which

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
overhead sprinkler mechanism which

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029 
overhead sprinkler mechanism which
worked<00:02:09.629> okay<00:02:09.929> last<00:02:10.170> year<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
worked okay last year but I think one of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.470 
worked okay last year but I think one of
the<00:02:11.160> problems<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.640> had<00:02:11.879> with<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> with

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
the problems that I had with the with

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.320

the mold

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.420 
the mold
that<00:02:13.450> formed<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:13.960> many<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.710> my<00:02:14.830> squash<00:02:15.100> plants

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
that formed on many of my squash plants

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.430 
that formed on many of my squash plants
is<00:02:15.520> because<00:02:15.850> i<00:02:15.880> was<00:02:16.240> watering<00:02:16.720> from<00:02:17.020> overhead

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
is because i was watering from overhead

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.520 
is because i was watering from overhead
so<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.310> year<00:02:18.550> i've<00:02:18.730> opted<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.630> lay<00:02:20.080> out<00:02:20.260> a
