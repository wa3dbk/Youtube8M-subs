didn't<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> lot<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> blood<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.939> there

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
didn't have a lot of blood in there

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.730 
didn't have a lot of blood in there
since<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.290> replaced<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.979> blood<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:57.740> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
since I replaced a blood in there that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.600 
since I replaced a blood in there that
runs<00:01:58.920> much<00:01:59.340> blood<00:01:59.670> or<00:01:59.880> better<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.310> it
