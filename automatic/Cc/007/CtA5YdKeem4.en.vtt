it<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> demo<00:00:43.489> jump<00:00:44.489> over<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> next

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it like a demo jump over to the next

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
it like a demo jump over to the next
building<00:00:46.550> now<00:00:47.550> each<00:00:47.820> level<00:00:48.390> has<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:49.399> practice

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
building now each level has a practice

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.240 
building now each level has a practice
mode<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.170> brings<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> into<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.920> jump

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
mode so it brings you into the jump

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.270 
mode so it brings you into the jump
simulator<00:00:53.850> which<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:55.280> practice

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
simulator which you can then practice

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.360

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the jump that you're about to do now you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.790 
the jump that you're about to do now you
can<00:00:59.640> die<00:00:59.910> as<00:00:59.969> many<00:01:00.270> times<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.590> the

can die as many times as you like in the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.649 
can die as many times as you like in the
jump<00:01:02.070> simulator<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.019> obviously<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.309> but

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
jump simulator and obviously don't but

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.810 
jump simulator and obviously don't but
playing<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.810> real<00:01:06.990> life<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.979> life

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.759 

this<00:03:26.230> one's<00:03:26.439> pretty<00:03:26.650> easy<00:03:28.530> don't<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.680> to

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
this one's pretty easy don't have to

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:38.330 
this one's pretty easy don't have to
click<00:03:29.950> anything

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.199 

and<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.269> one<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.840> easy<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.849> fact<00:03:42.120> that

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
and this one is easy to the fact that

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:52.360 
and this one is easy to the fact that
you<00:03:42.480> can't<00:03:42.840> click<00:03:43.319> anything<00:03:47.989> at<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.140> bottom

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:04.420 

this<00:03:53.370> one's<00:03:53.640> harder<00:03:54.120> than<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.330> looks

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.680 

yes

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.410 

now<00:04:07.990> this<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.470> level<00:04:08.920> where<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.220> get<00:04:09.940> the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
now this is the level where you get the

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.530 
now this is the level where you get the
one<00:04:10.630> extra<00:04:11.170> life<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.940> what<00:04:13.060> you've<00:04:13.180> got<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.420> do

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
one extra life so what you've got to do

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.190 
one extra life so what you've got to do
go<00:04:14.260> jump<00:04:14.500> right<00:04:14.740> at<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:15.040> end<00:04:15.220> and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
go jump right at the end and

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.180 
go jump right at the end and
theoretically<00:04:17.200> if<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.590> get<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.860> right<00:04:18.010> at<00:04:18.130> the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
theoretically if you get it right at the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.740 
theoretically if you get it right at the
end<00:04:18.340> there<00:04:18.459> should<00:04:18.640> be<00:04:18.760> an<00:04:18.910> invisible<00:04:19.450> cloud

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
end there should be an invisible cloud

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.290 
end there should be an invisible cloud
that<00:04:19.989> appears<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:23.500> with<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.770> cleared<00:04:24.300> it'll

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
that appears and with this cleared it'll

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.040 
that appears and with this cleared it'll
zoom<00:04:25.600> out<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:26.700> say<00:04:27.700> congratulations<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:29.020> have
