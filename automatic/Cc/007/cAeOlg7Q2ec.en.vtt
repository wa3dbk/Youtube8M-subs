 hi to all brik lovers today i am 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.189
 bought a small set under 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.840
 title go series knight set yourself 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.260
 includes these two cool 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.380
 minifigures such a gun that should 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.989
 shoot like this tanks and horse 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.760
 because the set is small for me 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.130
 no modifications for me 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.300
 interested but now consider what 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.520
 we have the most set 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.710
 and the first thing that strikes you is two 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.199
 these are the cool minifigures 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.660
 let's take a closer look 1 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.300
 minifigure is very cool and this is a knight 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.859
 blue army in the hands of me here 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:02.859
 golden sword on the head the helmet armor and 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.859
 raincoats 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.060
 BRIC designers try hard making 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.570
 these figures because the figures came out 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.620
 really cool and so our warrior 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.620
 looks without a helmet 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.610
 the second warrior is the knight of the red army 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:26.680
 he has such a helmet armor 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.530
 also cloak hands this warrior holds here 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.220
 such a silver sword and a masked 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.160
 This kind of face is hidden 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.890
 very friendly in the set also have 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.140
 horse and she can carry a gun 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.479
 if you wish, you can put one there 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.860
 of knights 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.649
 Also in the set there is such a gun 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.950
 which shoots now I'm you this 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.950
 will demonstrate 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.450
 I advise you to buy this kit exactly 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.250
