400<00:02:19.070> watts<00:02:19.640> per<00:02:19.850> pound<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.240> us<00:02:20.360> model<00:02:20.780> which

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
400 watts per pound on us model which

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.390 
400 watts per pound on us model which
gives<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.410> disturbing<00:02:21.860> light<00:02:21.980> performance

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
gives it a disturbing light performance

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.170 
gives it a disturbing light performance
and<00:02:23.320> if<00:02:24.320> we<00:02:24.560> were<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.740> put<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.820> lighter

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
and if we were to put that lighter

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.690 
and if we were to put that lighter
weight<00:02:26.390> pack<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:26.870> there<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:28.160> four<00:02:28.550> hundred

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
weight pack in there like four hundred

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.820 
weight pack in there like four hundred
twenty<00:02:29.090> watts<00:02:29.390> per<00:02:29.750> pound<00:02:29.960> it<00:02:30.500> should<00:02:30.710> be

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
twenty watts per pound it should be

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.760 
twenty watts per pound it should be
pretty<00:02:31.040> amazing<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.760> watch<00:02:32.050> no<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.260> winning

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
pretty amazing to watch no is it winning

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.910 
pretty amazing to watch no is it winning
actually<00:02:34.730> its<00:02:34.910> lands<00:02:35.270> very<00:02:35.630> nicely<00:02:35.930> it's<00:02:36.620> uh

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
actually its lands very nicely it's uh

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.680 
actually its lands very nicely it's uh
you<00:02:37.880> know<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.260> comes<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.470> very<00:02:39.710> slow<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.370> use<00:02:40.610> a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
you know the comes in very slow I use a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.260 
you know the comes in very slow I use a
trim<00:02:41.690> setting<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.680> puts<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.520> model<00:02:43.850> into<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
trim setting that puts the model into a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.960 
trim setting that puts the model into a
high<00:02:45.020> angle<00:02:45.320> attack<00:02:45.860> like<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.340> out<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.730> type<00:02:46.940> of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
high angle attack like I out the type of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.540 
high angle attack like I out the type of
light<00:02:47.210> condition<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.050> it's<00:02:48.980> very<00:02:49.250> easy<00:02:49.430> to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
light condition and it's very easy to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.880 
light condition and it's very easy to
land<00:02:49.790> maintains<00:02:50.330> control<00:02:50.510> right<00:02:50.990> down<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.500> the
