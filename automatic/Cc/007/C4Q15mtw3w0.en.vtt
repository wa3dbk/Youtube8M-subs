00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
the the max bitrate and the buffer size

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
the the max bitrate and the buffer size
so<00:01:37.220> I'm<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.430> run<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.759> down<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.970> about

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
microphone selected and I use as you can

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.069 
microphone selected and I use as you can
see<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:49.880> use<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.120> Siberia<00:03:50.630> version<00:03:50.930> too

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
see I use the Siberia version too

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.420 
see I use the Siberia version too

this is the very fast is actually normal

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.670 
this is the very fast is actually normal
as<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.240> it's<00:04:23.690> a<00:04:23.960> baseline

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
if your computer is bad you go to ultra

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.360 
if your computer is bad you go to ultra
fast<00:04:26.780> or<00:04:26.960> super<00:04:27.259> fast<00:04:27.470> if<00:04:27.710> your<00:04:27.830> computer<00:04:28.280> is

fast or super fast if your computer is

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.950 
fast or super fast if your computer is
very<00:04:28.400> good<00:04:28.910> like<00:04:29.150> my<00:04:29.330> computer<00:04:29.750> is

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
very good like my computer is

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.960 
very good like my computer is
top-of-the-line<00:04:30.770> then<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.669> wanna<00:04:31.789> go<00:04:31.849> to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
top-of-the-line then you wanna go to

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.589 
top-of-the-line then you wanna go to
medium<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.690> slow<00:04:32.840> or<00:04:33.050> slower

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
medium to slow or slower

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.420 
medium to slow or slower
basically<00:04:35.599> it<00:04:35.930> eats<00:04:36.289> it<00:04:36.530> massively<00:04:37.009> eats<00:04:37.250> up

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
basically it eats it massively eats up

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.790 
basically it eats it massively eats up
your<00:04:37.639> processing<00:04:38.210> power<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.780> get<00:04:39.199> a<00:04:39.349> very<00:04:39.680> very

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
your processing power to get a very very

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.010 
your processing power to get a very very
marginal<00:04:40.669> increase<00:04:41.330> in<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.509> quality<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.870> your

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
marginal increase in the quality of your

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.950 
marginal increase in the quality of your
stream<00:04:42.319> so<00:04:43.190> you<00:04:43.759> don't<00:04:44.060> don't<00:04:44.479> feel<00:04:44.690> like<00:04:44.810> it's

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
stream so you don't don't feel like it's

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.119 
stream so you don't don't feel like it's
necessary<00:04:45.080> pretty<00:04:45.560> good<00:04:45.710> lower<00:04:45.830> than<00:04:46.009> it's

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
necessary pretty good lower than it's

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.520 
necessary pretty good lower than it's
very<00:04:46.280> fast<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.759> good<00:04:46.940> for<00:04:47.120> 99.9%<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:48.139> people<00:04:48.379> I

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
very fast is good for 99.9% of people I

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.409 
very fast is good for 99.9% of people I
put<00:04:48.979> it<00:04:49.069> on<00:04:49.159> medium<00:04:49.310> design<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.270> what<00:04:50.360> I'm
