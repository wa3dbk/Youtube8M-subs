landing pads I would call them and to do

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
landing pads I would call them and to do
that<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.670> charged<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.479> sliding<00:01:16.140> them

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that you're charged with sliding them

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
that you're charged with sliding them
about<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.189> landing<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> certain<00:01:18.479> places

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and maneuvering so that they land where

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
and maneuvering so that they land where
they<00:01:21.509> should<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.380> once<00:01:22.500> you've<00:01:22.590> done

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
they should be that once you've done

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
they should be that once you've done
that<00:01:22.799> you've<00:01:23.159> completed<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> level<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
that you've completed the level and it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.270 
that you've completed the level and it
rates<00:01:24.930> how<00:01:25.110> well<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.470> did<00:01:25.619> based<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.100> how<00:01:26.220> many

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
rates how well you did based on how many

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
rates how well you did based on how many
moves<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.939> took<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> complete<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.020> level

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
moves you took to complete the level

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.440 
moves you took to complete the level
then<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> final<00:01:29.729> score<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.299> that's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
then you get a final score and that's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.560 
then you get a final score and that's
all<00:01:30.600> nice<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.020> grand<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.970> sounds<00:01:33.329> extremely

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
all nice and grand that sounds extremely

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.719 
all nice and grand that sounds extremely
simple<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.409> great<00:01:35.070> thing<00:01:35.100> about<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
simple but the great thing about this is

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.870 
simple but the great thing about this is
it<00:01:36.180> offers<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.689> lot<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.170> complexity<00:01:37.890> there's<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it offers a lot of complexity there's a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.450 
it offers a lot of complexity there's a
lot<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.409> there's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> option<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.159> add

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
lot of there's a lot of option to add

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
lot of there's a lot of option to add
some<00:01:41.700> interesting<00:01:42.060> features<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
some interesting features I'm going to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
some interesting features I'm going to
just<00:01:43.530> pick<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.189> random<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.640> see

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
just pick one of these at random and see

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.350 
just pick one of these at random and see
how<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> goes<00:01:46.220> for<00:01:47.220> instance<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.149> one

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
how it goes for instance and this one

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.660 
how it goes for instance and this one
specifically<00:01:48.950> you're<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.520> use

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
specifically you're going to have to use

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.469 
specifically you're going to have to use
the<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.210> pieces<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:52.369> maneuver<00:01:53.369> them<00:01:53.850> into<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the two pieces to maneuver them into the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
the two pieces to maneuver them into the
spots<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.439> sounds<00:01:56.100> complicated<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.610> i'll

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
spots that sounds complicated but i'll

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.429 
spots that sounds complicated but i'll
go<00:01:56.939> ahead<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.149> try<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> show<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> i'm<00:01:58.259> not

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
go ahead and try to show you i'm not

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
go ahead and try to show you i'm not
sure<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.649> i<00:01:58.710> remember<00:01:58.860> how<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.310> one<00:02:02.030> so

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
sure if i remember how to do this one so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.810 
sure if i remember how to do this one so
like<00:02:03.600> i'm<00:02:03.719> doing<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.140> i'm<00:02:04.229> using<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.759> one<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
like i'm doing here i'm using a one of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.210 
like i'm doing here i'm using a one of
the<00:02:05.909> game<00:02:06.060> pieces<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.719> stop<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.590> other<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the game pieces to stop the other one to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.609 
the game pieces to stop the other one to
put<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> certain<00:02:08.910> place<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.500> that's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
put it in a certain place and that's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.290 
put it in a certain place and that's
pretty<00:02:11.009> common<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.520> has<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> doing<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
pretty common that has you doing that a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.320 
pretty common that has you doing that a
lot<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.840> all

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
lot and all

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.480 
lot and all
so<00:02:13.420> there<00:02:13.720> will<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:13.930> there<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.710> be<00:02:14.890> walls<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
so there will be there will be walls and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.130 
so there will be there will be walls and
things<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.030> can<00:02:16.180> use<00:02:16.360> as<00:02:16.570> well<00:02:16.840> and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
things that you can use as well and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.470 
things that you can use as well and
while<00:02:18.010> we're<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.340> menu<00:02:18.580> here<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.210> can

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
while we're in the menu here you can

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.020 
while we're in the menu here you can
skip<00:02:19.870> any<00:02:20.080> puzzle<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.800> wish<00:02:21.130> there<00:02:21.850> is

an<00:02:22.150> unlimited<00:02:22.390> amount<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.870> skips<00:02:23.200> which<00:02:23.410> I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
an unlimited amount of skips which I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.630 
an unlimited amount of skips which I
thought<00:02:23.680> was<00:02:23.800> nice<00:02:24.010> because<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.460> kind<00:02:24.610> of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
thought was nice because it kind of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.030 
thought was nice because it kind of
takes<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.880> pressure<00:02:25.120> off<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:26.140> main<00:02:26.710> point

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
takes the pressure off in the main point

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.040 
takes the pressure off in the main point

I<00:02:35.020> found<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.700> app<00:02:36.880> really<00:02:37.120> reminded<00:02:37.450> me

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
I found this this app really reminded me

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.240 
I found this this app really reminded me
a<00:02:37.570> lot<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.720> portal<00:02:38.200> which<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> bit<00:02:38.770> odd<00:02:38.950> I

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
a lot of portal which is a bit odd I

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.190 
a lot of portal which is a bit odd I
don't<00:02:40.150> know<00:02:40.210> how<00:02:40.300> many<00:02:40.330> times<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.810> would<00:02:40.930> stop

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
don't know how many times I would stop

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.070 
don't know how many times I would stop
and<00:02:41.470> then<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.770> say<00:02:41.860> look<00:02:42.220> at<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> level<00:02:43.080> and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
and then just say look at a level and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.340 
and then just say look at a level and
then<00:02:44.260> try<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.470> figure<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:44.860> out<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:46.630> very

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
then try to figure it out it's very

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.260 
then try to figure it out it's very
enriching<00:02:47.800> experience<00:02:48.460> for<00:02:48.700> instance<00:02:49.030> like

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
enriching experience for instance like

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.900 
enriching experience for instance like
we<00:02:49.450> here<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:50.290> often<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.340> kind<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.550> SAT<00:02:51.790> and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
we here I often just kind of SAT and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.040 
we here I often just kind of SAT and
then<00:02:52.000> looked<00:02:52.240> at<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.540> then<00:02:52.630> figured<00:02:52.930> out

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
then looked at it and then figured out

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.600 
then looked at it and then figured out
exactly<00:02:53.230> what<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> needed<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.040> do<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:54.430> did

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
exactly what I needed to do and then did

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.190 
exactly what I needed to do and then did
it<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.880> then<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> little<00:02:55.930> endorphin

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
it and then you get the little endorphin

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.990 
it and then you get the little endorphin
rush<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.860> finishing<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.250> puzzle<00:02:57.610> when<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:57.880> all

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
rush of finishing a puzzle when it's all

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.870 
rush of finishing a puzzle when it's all
grand<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.560> this<00:02:59.920> one<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.310> actually<00:03:00.490> easier

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
grand but this one is actually easier

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.770 
grand but this one is actually easier

something go ahead and show you how to
do<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:03.190> example<00:03:03.430> I'm<00:03:04.270> going<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.510> use

do this for example I'm going to use

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.740 
do this for example I'm going to use
these<00:03:05.170> other<00:03:05.380> pieces<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:06.580> stop<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.390> other<00:03:07.480> two

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.020 
these other pieces to stop the other two
and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.320> slide<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:09.100> finish<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.610> up<00:03:09.760> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
it's things like that that make this a

fantastic<00:04:54.850> example<00:04:55.480> of<00:04:55.870> what<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.110> puzzler<00:04:56.470> can

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
fantastic example of what a puzzler can

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.159 
fantastic example of what a puzzler can
do<00:04:56.830> on<00:04:57.070> iOS<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.820> really<00:04:58.480> enjoyed<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.110> I

do on iOS I really enjoyed this and I

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.260 
do on iOS I really enjoyed this and I
think<00:04:59.229> I<00:04:59.770> think<00:05:00.070> it's<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.310> great<00:05:00.610> effort<00:05:00.910> by<00:05:01.120> the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
think I think it's a great effort by the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.180 
think I think it's a great effort by the
developer<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.020> because<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.710> those<00:05:02.979> things

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
developer and because of those things

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.010 
developer and because of those things
I'm<00:05:03.370> going<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.550> give<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:03.790> a<00:05:03.850> solid<00:05:04.150> five<00:05:04.600> stars

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020
