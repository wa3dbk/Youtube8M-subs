00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and the power at jellified water that's

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.460 
and the power at jellified water that's
what<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.519> send<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.539> tribe<00:00:27.840> man<00:00:28.109> through

what you do send a tribe man through
there<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:32.149> this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.210> my<00:00:33.390> way<00:00:33.870> by<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.800> doing<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
there and this is my way by of doing it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
there and this is my way by of doing it
I<00:00:35.370> kind<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> figured<00:00:36.149> out<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.660> glitch

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I kind of figured out a little glitch

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.150 
I kind of figured out a little glitch
they<00:00:37.770> done<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.489> jellify<00:00:38.969> water<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:40.160> then

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
they done do jellify water and then

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580 
they done do jellify water and then
press<00:00:41.670> LT<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.360> T<00:00:42.510> at<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> same<00:00:42.960> time<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
press LT and on T at the same time so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.310 
press LT and on T at the same time so
you<00:00:43.649> plunk<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.160> there<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.360> keep<00:00:45.750> doing<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you plunk it there and keep doing that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
you plunk it there and keep doing that
until<00:00:48.050> your<00:00:49.050> tribe<00:00:49.350> man<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.890> goes<00:00:50.309> over

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
until your tribe man actually goes over

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.690 
until your tribe man actually goes over
the<00:00:50.910> wall<00:00:52.070> like<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.450 

there<00:00:58.700> you<00:00:58.820> go<00:00:59.650> she's<00:01:00.650> gone<00:01:00.829> over<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.220> ball

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.610 

it's<00:01:04.460> actually<00:01:04.879> like<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.449> little<00:01:06.170> glitch<00:01:06.410> I

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
it's actually like a little glitch I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.350 
it's actually like a little glitch I
found<00:01:06.920> out<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:07.310> not<00:01:07.370> how<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:07.670> actually<00:01:07.970> do

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
found out it's not how you actually do

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.870 
found out it's not how you actually do
the<00:01:08.540> challenge<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:12.130> but<00:01:13.130> I<00:01:13.160> found<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.729> really

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
the challenge so but I found it really

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.490 
the challenge so but I found it really
easy<00:01:13.970> just<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.780> like<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:17.140> now<00:01:18.140> get

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
easy just to do it like this so now get

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.230 
easy just to do it like this so now get
rid<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.680> all<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.010> water<00:01:19.220> before<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:19.970> turns

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
rid of all the water before that turns

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.420 
rid of all the water before that turns
back<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.630> normal<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.140> flush<00:01:21.410> your<00:01:21.590> village<00:01:21.979> to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
back to normal and flush your village to

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:34.510 
back to normal and flush your village to
get<00:01:22.610> rid<00:01:22.760> of<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:23.000> all<00:01:26.200> like<00:01:27.200> this

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.149 

and<00:01:34.640> then<00:01:35.359> this<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.320> boring<00:01:36.679> bit<00:01:36.859> of<00:01:37.009> the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
and then this is the boring bit of the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.499 
and then this is the boring bit of the
glitch<00:01:37.399> or<00:01:39.189> technique<00:01:40.189> I<00:01:40.340> found<00:01:40.640> out<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.210> don't

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
glitch or technique I found out I don't

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.719 
glitch or technique I found out I don't
really<00:01:41.750> know<00:01:42.500> why<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:43.340> could<00:01:43.490> be<00:01:43.700> a

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
really know why it is it could be a

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.310 
really know why it is it could be a
glitch<00:01:44.090> or<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.360> could<00:01:44.509> be<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:44.869> another<00:01:45.110> way

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
glitch or it could be just another way

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.130 
glitch or it could be just another way
of<00:01:45.350> doing<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:45.829> but<00:01:46.149> it's<00:01:47.149> my<00:01:47.329> way<00:01:47.539> of<00:01:47.569> doing<00:01:47.990> it

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
of doing it but it's my way of doing it

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.160 
of doing it but it's my way of doing it
let's<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:48.500> leave<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.829> as<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.960> just<00:01:50.960> wait

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
let's just leave it as that just wait

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.880 
let's just leave it as that just wait
until<00:01:52.060> your<00:01:53.060> power<00:01:53.329> jellified<00:01:53.929> water<00:01:54.259> comes

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
until your power jellified water comes

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.429 
until your power jellified water comes
back<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:56.780> you're<00:01:56.899> actually<00:01:57.020> supposed

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
back and what you're actually supposed

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.649 
back and what you're actually supposed
to<00:01:57.500> do<00:01:57.740> there's<00:01:58.039> fire<00:01:58.250> trees<00:01:58.640> there<00:01:58.969> you're

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
to do there's fire trees there you're

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.139 
to do there's fire trees there you're
supposed<00:01:59.929> to<00:01:59.990> use<00:02:00.170> jellified<00:02:00.709> water<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.610> get

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
supposed to use jellified water and get

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.090 
supposed to use jellified water and get
rid<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.479> water<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.259> stuff<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:03.979> the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
rid of the water and stuff and then the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.679 
rid of the water and stuff and then the
fire<00:02:04.310> will<00:02:04.610> eventually<00:02:05.119> come<00:02:05.329> all<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.569> way

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
fire will eventually come all the way

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.259 
fire will eventually come all the way
round<00:02:05.959> plot<00:02:06.799> those<00:02:07.039> explosive<00:02:07.729> trees<00:02:08.030> and

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
round plot those explosive trees and

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.120 
round plot those explosive trees and
then<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.569> can<00:02:08.780> actually<00:02:09.140> get<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:10.120> but<00:02:11.950> why<00:02:12.950> not

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
then you can actually get it but why not

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.069 
then you can actually get it but why not
make<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.370> easy<00:02:13.700> for<00:02:13.880> ourselves<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:14.690> skip

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
make it easy for ourselves and just skip

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.199 
make it easy for ourselves and just skip
that<00:02:15.290> oh<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.709> just<00:02:15.890> use<00:02:16.069> jellify<00:02:16.579> water<00:02:16.849> and

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
that oh and just use jellify water and

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.880 
that oh and just use jellify water and
just<00:02:17.390> go<00:02:17.510> over<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.870> wall<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.709> it's<00:02:21.709> my

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
just go over the wall so it's my

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.880 
just go over the wall so it's my
technique<00:02:22.459> my<00:02:22.849> way<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.930> doing<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.410> found<00:02:24.769> it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
technique my way of doing it I found it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.100 
technique my way of doing it I found it
really<00:02:25.099> easy<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.489> do<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:28.780> tried<00:02:29.780> doing<00:02:29.930> it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
really easy to do it I tried doing it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.350 
really easy to do it I tried doing it
the<00:02:30.230> proper<00:02:30.470> way<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.430> was<00:02:31.519> really<00:02:31.670> hard<00:02:31.970> so

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
the proper way and it was really hard so

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.280 
the proper way and it was really hard so
I<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.810> stuck<00:02:32.989> with<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.319> way<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> once<00:02:36.110> your

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
I just stuck with this way so once your

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.890 
I just stuck with this way so once your
power<00:02:36.620> jellify<00:02:37.220> water<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.790> back<00:02:38.030> use<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.690> again

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
power jellify water is back use it again

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.740 
power jellify water is back use it again
and<00:02:39.079> then<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.799> exactly<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.549> same<00:02:40.579> but<00:02:41.450> on<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and then do exactly the same but on the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.349 
and then do exactly the same but on the
other<00:02:41.870> side<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.560> keep<00:02:42.889> clunking<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.489> on<00:02:43.639> her<00:02:44.060> or

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
other side so keep clunking it on her or

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.330 
other side so keep clunking it on her or
him<00:02:45.850> until<00:02:46.850> they<00:02:47.030> go<00:02:47.209> over<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> wall<00:02:48.340> like

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
him until they go over the wall like

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.300 
him until they go over the wall like
that

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.350 

just<00:02:55.760> keep<00:02:55.940> pumping<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.450> on<00:02:56.630> her<00:02:56.930> or<00:02:57.170> him<00:02:58.360> until

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
just keep pumping it on her or him until

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:08.010

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.400
