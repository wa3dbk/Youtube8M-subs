00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.230

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.030

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.130
 of the five that I love 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.319
 so there is fruit tea here but no 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.090
 is that we will use today what 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.709

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.899

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:36.229
 We buy at the market. I'll leave it. 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.539

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.009
 Also coming here I will not put water 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.280
 to boil and when I explained to 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.289
 you other things to how the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.649

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.649
 school is 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:02.299
 This is what 's so annoying for me. 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.560
 I'll just went down in the milk for a shake is 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.799
 with milk 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.629
 I like milk a lot, it's not 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:15.260
 hid if you put these green squares 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:18.080
 which is a cream that looks like a butter 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.660
 111 seems curd but the truth has 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.580
 a full creamy taste 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.660
 It's just like the sour cream so you 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.989
 was found with one and puts jelly 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.420
 strawberry may be from the native raspberry that 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.630
 you want 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.720
 there I was explaining myself thus 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:50.810
 You put cream and a strawberry underneath it 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:55.459
 where love is the first cream is from 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:01.239
 Other place like I prefer it so I 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.239
 I prefer that we'll do what 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:20.410

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:22.940

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:30.019

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.630
 How does it work is where it's from 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.359
 that explanation that from the first 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.880
 cream then the jelly the first after 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:04.190
 the cream is kind on the river we put 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.410
 beans and bota thing on top I think 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.120
 in São Paulo will rise 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.430
 rice, but at the end of the 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.670
 beads is the same thing I prefer with 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.740
 more cream than with more than cheerful 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.480
 but there are people who prefer the image is 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.480

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.310
