you<00:01:32.540> actually<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.770> think<00:01:34.580> it's<00:01:34.939> better<00:01:35.000> just

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
you actually I think it's better just

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.940 
you actually I think it's better just
farming<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.750> first<00:01:36.020> guy<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.200> can<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.770> can

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
farming this first guy you can you can

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.130 
farming this first guy you can you can
get<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.130> lot<00:01:37.340> more<00:01:37.369> kills<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.150> know<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
get a lot more kills and you know in the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.870 
get a lot more kills and you know in the
time<00:01:39.380> period<00:01:39.920> then<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.430> can<00:01:40.640> by<00:01:40.850> going

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
time period then you can by going

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.120 
time period then you can by going
through<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.630> farming<00:01:42.110> all<00:01:42.229> four<00:01:42.470> I<00:01:42.500> hope<00:01:42.890> that

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
through and farming all four I hope that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.219 
through and farming all four I hope that
made<00:01:43.340> sense<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.850> probably<00:01:44.240> didn't<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.080> there

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
made sense it probably didn't but there

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.590 
made sense it probably didn't but there
you<00:01:45.350> can<00:01:45.500> see<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.979> very<00:01:46.250> first<00:01:46.640> guy<00:01:46.970> the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
you can see that the very first guy the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.210 
you can see that the very first guy the
very<00:01:47.900> first<00:01:48.200> assassin<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.740> come<00:01:49.009> across

to drop the Emperor I want to throw that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.230 
to drop the Emperor I want to throw that
out<00:02:00.920> there<00:02:01.220> there's<00:02:01.430> other<00:02:01.579> guys<00:02:01.820> that<00:02:02.119> have

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
out there there's other guys that have

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.950 
out there there's other guys that have
got<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.509> from<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
got it from the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.560 
got it from the
second<00:02:03.229> guy<00:02:03.380> third<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.640> fourth<00:02:05.000> but<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.330> just

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
second guy third and fourth but I just

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.910 
second guy third and fourth but I just
think<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:05.930> quicker<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.470> more<00:02:06.650> time

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
think it's quicker and more time

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.859 
think it's quicker and more time
convenient<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.940> do<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.300> first<00:02:08.569> one<00:02:08.750> but

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
convenient to do that first one but

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.910 
convenient to do that first one but

it's actually the highest damage out of
all<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> legendary<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:20.900> when<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.170> zoom<00:02:21.200> in

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
on target it's going to destroy it to

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.820 
on target it's going to destroy it to
destroy<00:02:31.730> most<00:02:32.120> enemies<00:02:32.750> when<00:02:33.470> you're<00:02:33.650> not

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
aiming downsizing you're just simply

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.660 
aiming downsizing you're just simply
hipfiring<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.080> will<00:02:36.230> be<00:02:36.350> full<00:02:36.590> auto<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.160> do<00:02:37.250> not

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
hipfiring it will be full auto I do not

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.220 
hipfiring it will be full auto I do not
show<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:37.940> an<00:02:38.090> example<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.080> rate

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
show you an example of that but the rate

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.800 
show you an example of that but the rate
of<00:02:39.350> fire<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.800> pretty<00:02:40.010> slow<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.610> suggest<00:02:41.510> aiming

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
of fire is pretty slow I suggest aiming

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.600 
of fire is pretty slow I suggest aiming
down<00:02:41.930> sights<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.430> see

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
down sights like this and you can see

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.460 
down sights like this and you can see
every<00:02:44.030> single<00:02:44.060> enemy<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.900> V<00:02:45.080> shield<00:02:45.320> on

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
every single enemy with this V shield on

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.620 
every single enemy with this V shield on
its<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.280> bursting<00:02:46.730> or<00:02:46.970> there<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.209> didn't<00:02:47.570> have

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
its one bursting or there I didn't have

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.910 
its one bursting or there I didn't have
it<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:47.900> target<00:02:48.110> all<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.380> way<00:02:48.470> it's<00:02:48.709> too

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
it on target all the way it's too

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.430
