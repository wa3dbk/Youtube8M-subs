00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello here the patrician of the frontiers and 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.429
 today came to show that a different video 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.910
 for you it 's a tutorial on how to do 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 ghost attack using the device 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.510
 android 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.350
 first that is a shortcut ghost 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 well the ghost attack it is a simulator 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 attacks in which you can simulate the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.510
 attack 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 in the case of a new battle of war or 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.899
 then a revenge ie you go 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.540
 to be able to make an attack that is no longer worth 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.670
 that you will be able to know what the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.550
 enemy troops and what is the best 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 strategy to be used to 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.430
 get 100% in this case you go 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.500
 to be able to do as many times as you want 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.960
 can use all the strategies you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.109
 imagine from all sides you can 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.320
 to repeatedly attack the same village 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 and will not tell you how to do it 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.090
 then these ghost attacks 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.939
 first of all, this part here 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.510
 maybe not do not go if possible all 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.680
 do you need to deal with 3g 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 disconnected from either the watch or the tablet 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 only wifi has to be connected from these 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.750
 devices and second you will be 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.759
 What are you doing at home? 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.780
 probably because you're going to need it 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.970
 of a separate modem and router 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.470
 How will I introduce you to them? 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.970
 here these instruments 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.750
 This is the modem, I know you need it. 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.630
 so you need to have a router 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.909
 this is our router that the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.780
 router in mexico continuous router 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.630
 working normal what we're going to do 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.420
 will be what at the time of the attack 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.380
 At the time of the attack, we're going. 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.020
 simply starting the attack but being 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.590
 off the network cable that is this 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.039
 gray here this network cable it will be 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.290
 It's hard when it's time. 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.650
 who started the attack before putting the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.790
 troops 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.099
 We are going to show here through the village. 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.599
 my husband the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.519
 this poor and neighbor village that is 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.459
 money or always cry when I look 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.349
 the brother's village because it's very few 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.579
 resources that it always has 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.670
 poor girl 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:36.450
 It makes you sad when you see 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.349
 only 8 million gold 6 million 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.439
 invest 66 the dark is a situation 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.780
 so it causes a lot of sadness even 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:49.590
 not notice in the village almost all 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.420
 maximum for growing well almost to be seen 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.579
 almost inconceivable and 10 is not lacking 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.519
 in those muraki rosinha even more do the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.950
 that he is prioritizing the defenses 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.900
 then having these instruments what we 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.150
 Let's pretend we're going to simulate an attack. 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.739
 of vengeance and you will see how 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.959
 Does this simulator work? 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.810
 Okay, so I'm going to spend the tablet here. 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.700
 to the ego or to start doing the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.329
 revenge attack I'll try to shoot 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.660
 here more or less how he can 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.489
 can you go and get one? 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.389
 revenge to make it take that it is 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.160
 Someone's gonna have to break the shield. 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.620
 Let's not stop being hard bread, let's go 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.159
 see if we can find a village here 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.930
 to be able to make the attack because well tac 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.699
 village 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.949
 so what you need will have to 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:40.919
 disconnected and started the attack or not 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:43.440
 with the troops still hung up the cable 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.379
 careful can not put the troops 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.139
 initiate the attack itself without 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.150
 disconnect the network cable 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.810
 disconnects if the network cable is 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.810
 start the attack 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.750
 the attack lÃ©o 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.770
 we just gotta play here and 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.590
 show you're playing all the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:20.900
 own it he troop 2 the attack does not 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.620
 if known 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.510
 the network cable but if you disconnect wifi will 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.480
 interrupting this is the big problem of 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.820
 android is the one that interrupts when 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.420
 enters airplane mode but when 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.850
 disconnects a network cable from the 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.660
 direct from monday until that information 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.310
 reach the router is not the system that 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.680
 android in the process 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.310
 so the game it ends up doing it goes 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.180
 defeat render that looks at the troop that he 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.720
 used 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.730
 now it will switch back on again. 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.540
 cable that will lock the game can see no 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.920
 return 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:04.100
 it will have to connect the network cable and 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.880
 put a network cable and put the cable 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.460
 network 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.920
 coming back you will have to collect what is the 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.920
 game and we will see surprise surprise 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.470
 surprise surprise where the troops go 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.030
 show the NATO troops are all 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.560
 the information of the troops 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.610
 troops all troops were not made 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.550
 no attack 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.550
 or that is our ghost attack there 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.890
 I hope you enjoy it, enjoy it 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.920
 while the super sky does not discover this 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.490
 Our art, this new mother this morning. 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.360
 and has some success in wars and 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.540
 lives 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.540
 ok a big hug to you and even more
