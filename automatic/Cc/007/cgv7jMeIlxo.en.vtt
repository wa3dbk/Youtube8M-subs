00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
 last review on spintires have this bmw 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.980
 x6 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:22.769
 vidok okhuenchik not true dad mind 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 generally awesome of course done whether 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.050
 done whether converted from scratch 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.859
 of course to do such and such a thing by the way 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.600
 it turns the wheels along with 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.590
 wheels and it can not but rejoice 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.239
 because most of it including 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.780
 Fifteen which was before this she 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.320
 she didn't turn up there is some 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.300
 some kind of trim in the cabin a little bit there 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.579
 peeps but because of the workout 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.520
 Nichrome can not see anything so look at 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.520
 she has only wheels wheels in bravo 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 go 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.430
 fine menacing 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.140
 probably the most likely to say that as a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.960
 sports car and we will naturally drive it 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 check on the sport ground 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.500
 that is, that you do not see that everything is strong 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.240
 you accelerated no quietly razgonchik 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.909
 then it takes a period 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.460
 let's go let's go oops full 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.270
 We turn on the drive naturally so that we have 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.520
 less differential but formidable 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.520
 terrible terrible car screenshot on 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 thumbnail immediately fly into the trees pancake 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.830
 all razgonchik 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.789
 car at all in the smithereens fucking I'm generally in 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.250
 terrified oh well we accelerate watching 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.990
 no, I can honestly tell you 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.710
 cool car on it 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.910
 to drive 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.230
 really drive it 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.959
 cool 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.580
 jumps very well well enough 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.330
 jumps because unnecessary 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.790
 jumping ability 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.280
 if he had that it would have been 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.180
 fatal to the car respectively 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.970
 for pilot if for pilot means for 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.700
 passengers and if for passengers 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.010
 it means all fucked up 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.950
