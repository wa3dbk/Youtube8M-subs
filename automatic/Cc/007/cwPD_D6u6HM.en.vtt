00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.390

obviously it's a huge honor but I just

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.240 
obviously it's a huge honor but I just
think<00:00:12.760> it<00:00:12.880> goes<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.179> show<00:00:13.530> how<00:00:14.530> our<00:00:14.710> team<00:00:14.920> has

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
think it goes to show how our team has

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.060 
think it goes to show how our team has
fared<00:00:15.670> in<00:00:15.849> this<00:00:16.029> first<00:00:16.299> month<00:00:16.509> of<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:16.689> season

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
played pretty well and yeah it just

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.749 
played pretty well and yeah it just
shows<00:00:22.869> how<00:00:22.899> our<00:00:23.169> teams<00:00:23.349> from<00:00:23.500> doing<00:00:23.759> only

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759

Nelson's<00:00:25.360> on<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.689> road<00:00:25.810> again<00:00:26.020> comes<00:00:26.290> to

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
Nelson's on the road again comes to

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.170 
Nelson's on the road again comes to
minus<00:00:26.829> maybe<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.369> new<00:00:27.489> theme<00:00:27.700> song<00:00:27.730> for<00:00:28.119> the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
team what's it like going on again

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.979 
team what's it like going on again
having<00:00:29.950> played<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.309> well<00:00:30.340> I<00:00:30.700> think<00:00:31.509> it's<00:00:31.779> part

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
having played so well I think it's part

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.330 
having played so well I think it's part
of<00:00:32.050> being<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.259> professional<00:00:32.380> you<00:00:32.890> just<00:00:33.100> you

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
of being a professional you just you

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.560 
of being a professional you just you
mean<00:00:33.550> that's<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:33.850> schedule<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.300> then<00:00:34.450> that

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
mean that's a schedule and then that

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.119 
mean that's a schedule and then that
means<00:00:34.690> you'll<00:00:34.899> have<00:00:34.989> more<00:00:35.170> goal<00:00:35.350> games<00:00:35.920> at

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
means you'll have more goal games at

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.950 
means you'll have more goal games at
home<00:00:36.250> so<00:00:37.090> we're<00:00:37.300> looking<00:00:37.420> forward<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.929> that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
yeah I think it builds character you

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.050 
yeah I think it builds character you
know<00:01:08.530> when<00:01:08.920> you're<00:01:09.040> up<00:01:09.130> at<00:01:09.250> 5am<00:01:09.759> in<00:01:09.970> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
know when you're up at 5am in the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.670 
know when you're up at 5am in the
morning<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.869> nobody<00:01:11.290> wants<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.500> be<00:01:11.590> up

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
morning and you nobody wants to be up

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.960 
morning and you nobody wants to be up
that<00:01:11.860> early<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.310> you're<00:01:12.460> doing<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.790> together

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
that early but you're doing it together

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.840 
that early but you're doing it together
you<00:01:13.899> build<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.649> then<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.220> develop

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
you build that and then you you develop

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.830 
you build that and then you you develop
you<00:01:15.970> get<00:01:16.149> to<00:01:16.240> know<00:01:16.360> more<00:01:16.479> about<00:01:16.540> your

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
you get to know more about your

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.210 
you get to know more about your
teammates<00:01:17.350> because<00:01:17.649> you're<00:01:17.920> rooming

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
teammates because you're rooming

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.440 
teammates because you're rooming
together<00:01:18.399> and<00:01:18.850> you're<00:01:18.939> doing<00:01:19.090> all<00:01:19.299> these

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
together and you're doing all these

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.760 
together and you're doing all these
little<00:01:19.659> things<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:20.170> when<00:01:20.530> you're<00:01:20.649> at<00:01:20.740> home

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
little things that when you're at home

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.920 
little things that when you're at home
you<00:01:21.430> kind<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.670> go<00:01:21.820> home<00:01:22.000> but<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.450> think<00:01:22.810> what's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
you kind of go home but I think what's

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.030 
you kind of go home but I think what's
special<00:01:23.079> about<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:23.439> team<00:01:23.649> is<00:01:23.740> even<00:01:23.920> when

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
special about this team is even when

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.620 
special about this team is even when
we're<00:01:24.159> at<00:01:24.219> home<00:01:24.280> we're<00:01:25.030> doing<00:01:25.240> stuff<00:01:25.450> together

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
we're at home we're doing stuff together

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.230 
we're at home we're doing stuff together
so<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.530> think<00:01:26.890> all<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.399> chemistry<00:01:27.820> helps<00:01:28.119> us

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
so I think all that chemistry helps us

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.730 
so I think all that chemistry helps us
in<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.450> field<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:28.930> I<00:01:29.020> think<00:01:29.259> being<00:01:29.500> on<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
in the field and I think being on the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.310 
in the field and I think being on the
