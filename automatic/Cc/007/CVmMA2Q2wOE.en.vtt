00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make a super 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:14.509
 puma generating kz who taught me how to do 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 similar was a master of the masters of 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.410
 bandeirantes that is called Ítalo carvalho 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.150
 lives in Salvador and gave the suggestion and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.850
 also passed all instructions 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.510
 how to do and how to hurl the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.460
 boomerang 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.609
 You're going to need things a lot. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.640
 of an ice cream pack 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.750
 used is the one that you throw away the guard 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.300
 for nothing in the house of a mold this mold 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.290
 here is the merengue shipment with the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.140
 right hand 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.309
 if you do not know right-handed and left - handed 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.379
 renaissance the number one way 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.660
 different and you will also need 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 a staple of a pen to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.809
 to write a seat can be a little pen 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 a pencil anything I got 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.480
 write on the plastic and a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 scissors 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.289
 to start you have to cut a 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.090
 piece of mold after passing this mold 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.120
 to the ice cream bin at the place 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 be straight without curves and trim the mold 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.570
 in the box 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.580
 you need to cut 3 pieces 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.049
 different you will also realize that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.820
 the box lets you do more or less 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.369
 a three boomerang and now it's time 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.439
 of joining these three little things the three 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.420
 parts must be well distributed or 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.460
 be you can not leave two sides 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.409
 near the other so far has to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.090
 put the three in the same distance 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.040
 forming a beautiful figure is is the question 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.560
 there are three pieces and I'll mark these 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.630
 three pieces of the special way put a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.630
 in red here the parts that go by 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.640
 on top of the other 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 So I'll get this part to put 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.049
 on top of the other have to leave this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.530
 Well done, and put this 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.100
 other party above as well and the third 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.210
 part that goes over and over 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.590
 so we now have a braid and the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.420
 We have to distribute the pieces well. 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.040
 to stay well aligned as well 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.340
 aligned so it's time for you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.590
 staple number is already in a format 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.659
 boomerang and now it's time to double 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.989
 these bridges here so I'll get 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.819
 each dot here and bend down 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.670
 the ideal is to use a wood with a corner 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.680
 well live strong corner and bend a 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.690
 bit down here scoring well 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.769
 this dotted line later you can 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.450
 better adjust the angle of this angle 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.470
 work is more or less the one you are 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.150
 seeing here does not need to be very closed 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.180
 and to improve the aerodynamics I go 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.400
 to draw a close tie on these little 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.440
 The clip that has been left here is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.120
 It's time to decorate our great 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.519
 I'm going to clean up all this dirt that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.319
 with alcohol and the master all recommends that 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.390
 we only run the middle of the boomerang 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.700
 that's not to get your hands dirty 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.709
 hold the tip and also only part of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.280
 because it is the boomerang pattern 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.769
 the number is not 100% ready but I 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.959
 I have to say that doing the boomerang is 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.090
 the easy part of history because 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.600
 now we have to hurl the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.519
 government takes a look at the instructions 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.230
 The master passed the first thing that 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.220
 You have to learn is the right way to 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.410
 hold on 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.329
 the memo must close its hand and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.280
 put the number in this little joke here 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.280
 between the index finger and thumb 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.180
 The second thing is that it can not be 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.010
 flipped horizontally and also be 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.720
 tossed vertically a little bit 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.720
 angled right 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.750
 another important thing this distance 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.209
 between Iran and his hand without placing there 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.579
 very close here the hand can not let is 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.579
 so you have to leave it close here. 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.370
 something else that tip you can 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.400
 hold very lightly as if you had 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.200
 with disgust of merengue for it to come out easy 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.450
 at the time of throwing that last 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.720
 thing is that you have to play a great 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.640
 with the fist and not the whole arm and I 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.109
 I forgot to mention that when it comes to 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 To throw you have to keep your arm. 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.090
 here on the side of the trunk more or less 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.950
 here at the height of the head and then just play 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.320
 meringue make up 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:52.240
 Talk is easy, let's try to play this. 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:53.889
 business now but here I am playing 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.699
 a number that only takes a look at what the 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.699
 Italo does 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.060
 but they started here you find in the 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.840
 world manual 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.790
 if you got really excited about the idea 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.340
 boomerang I 'm leaving here at 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.990
 down the ita blog link soon goes 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.180
 teach to do several other models 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.220
 yet how it works is as 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.290
 cid championship in uberlândia and monte de 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.720
 thing I wanted to also thank 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.360
 lucas menezes who was the one who filmed the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.380
 I tossed it meranti there in 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.390
 savior 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.720
 is down here leaving two links of 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.260
 things hurl weiss threw six 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.360
 levels that things you can play a 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.150
 paper airplane that goes very far 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.760
 The plan was very cool this year. 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.290
 side here and said other side lets the 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.410
 link liver pathway testing link from 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.650
 origami ninja star who is also 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.650
 very cool
