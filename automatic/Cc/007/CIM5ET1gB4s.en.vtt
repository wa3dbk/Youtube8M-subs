we're<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.750> go<00:00:31.230> through<00:00:32.210> your<00:00:33.210> good

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
we're going to go through your good

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.720 
we're going to go through your good
position<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> Swiss<00:00:34.410> ball<00:00:34.680> sitting<00:00:35.610> with

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
position on the Swiss ball sitting with

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
position on the Swiss ball sitting with
your<00:00:35.850> legs<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.329> hips<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.200> knees<00:00:37.350> at

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
your legs at hips and knees at

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.670 
your legs at hips and knees at
approximately<00:00:38.219> 90<00:00:38.610> degrees<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.680> getting

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
approximately 90 degrees and getting

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.310 
approximately 90 degrees and getting
into<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> neutral<00:00:41.489> spine<00:00:41.760> position<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
into the neutral spine position so the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
into the neutral spine position so the
neutral<00:00:43.590> spine<00:00:43.860> position<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.730> upright

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
neutral spine position is is upright

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.049 
neutral spine position is is upright
approximately<00:00:45.989> 30<00:00:46.649> degrees<00:00:47.010> extension<00:00:47.640> so

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
approximately 30 degrees extension so

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.029 
approximately 30 degrees extension so
just<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> tack<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.899> little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
just to tack up a little bit it's a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.850 
just to tack up a little bit it's a
little<00:00:50.070> too<00:00:50.399> far<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
little too far that's it it's going to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
little too far that's it it's going to
vary<00:00:53.070> slightly<00:00:53.309> from<00:00:53.789> person<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> person<00:00:54.570> but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
vary slightly from person to person but

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
vary slightly from person to person but
it<00:00:55.289> should<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.559> comfortable<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> natural

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it should be comfortable and a natural

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.439 
it should be comfortable and a natural
balance<00:00:57.840> between<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.280> head<00:00:59.520> shoulder<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
balance between the head shoulder and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
balance between the head shoulder and
hips<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.320> good<00:01:01.680> alignment<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
hips in good alignment is that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.509 
hips in good alignment is that
comfortable<00:01:02.730> yeah<00:01:03.510> okay<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> can

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
comfortable yeah okay so see if you can

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.719 
comfortable yeah okay so see if you can
maintain<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.689> position<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.490> just<00:01:08.490> gently

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
maintain that position and just gently

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.200 
maintain that position and just gently
roll<00:01:09.060> forwards<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.869> backwards<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> ball

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
roll forwards and backwards on the ball

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
roll forwards and backwards on the ball
that's<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.710> movement<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.159> coming<00:01:14.460> from

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that's it so the movement is coming from

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.270 
that's it so the movement is coming from
your<00:01:14.760> hips<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> your<00:01:15.270> knees<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.280> you're

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
your hips and your knees and you're

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
your hips and your knees and you're
maintaining<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.939> neutral<00:01:18.090> position<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.869> your

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
maintaining the neutral position of your

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
maintaining the neutral position of your
spine<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.369> core<00:01:20.580> remains<00:01:20.909> stable<00:01:23.030> once

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
spine and the core remains stable once

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.749 
spine and the core remains stable once
control<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.600> achieved<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.470> position<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
control is achieved in this position you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.490 
control is achieved in this position you
can<00:01:26.790> introduce<00:01:27.180> lateral<00:01:27.750> movement

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.310 

as<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:34.580> feel<00:01:34.790> one<00:01:35.420> leg<00:01:35.660> can<00:01:35.870> comfortably

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
as you feel one leg can comfortably

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.050 
as you feel one leg can comfortably
receive<00:01:36.740> all<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.040> weight<00:01:37.220> see<00:01:37.730> if<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:37.910> can

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
receive all the weight see if you can

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.020 
receive all the weight see if you can
lift<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.450> opposite<00:01:38.900> leg<00:01:42.580> it's<00:01:43.580> important

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
lift the opposite leg it's important

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.230 
lift the opposite leg it's important
that<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.270> weight<00:01:44.450> shifts<00:01:44.960> laterally<00:01:45.500> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
that the weight shifts laterally and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.300 
that the weight shifts laterally and
that<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.660> body<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.530> center<00:01:48.830> of<00:01:48.890> gravity<00:01:49.250> is

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
that the body the center of gravity is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.219 
that the body the center of gravity is
still<00:01:49.520> aligned<00:01:49.880> over<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.390> over<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
still aligned over this over the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.500 
still aligned over this over the
weight-bearing<00:01:51.560> hip<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.130> leg<00:01:52.790> which<00:01:53.270> then

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
weight-bearing hip and leg which then

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.109 
weight-bearing hip and leg which then
allows<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.930> opposite<00:01:54.320> leg<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.680> move<00:01:54.830> freely

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
allows the opposite leg to move freely

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.430 
allows the opposite leg to move freely
this<00:01:56.119> provides<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.720> most<00:01:56.900> efficient

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
this provides the most efficient

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.510 
this provides the most efficient
movement<00:01:59.290> once<00:02:00.290> that's<00:02:00.530> mastered<00:02:01.070> we<00:02:01.220> can<00:02:01.400> add

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
movement once that's mastered we can add

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.580 
movement once that's mastered we can add
the<00:02:01.670> upper<00:02:01.790> limb<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.360> movement<00:02:02.750> if<00:02:02.990> you're

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the upper limb to the movement if you're

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.350 
the upper limb to the movement if you're
of<00:02:03.800> your<00:02:04.010> weights<00:02:04.190> accepted<00:02:04.700> onto<00:02:04.850> one<00:02:05.119> side

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
of your weights accepted onto one side

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.790 
of your weights accepted onto one side
you<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.140> mimic<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.560> running<00:02:06.830> action<00:02:08.800> that's

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
you can mimic the running action that's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.290 
you can mimic the running action that's
it<00:02:10.040> and<00:02:10.640> then<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.150> other<00:02:11.180> side<00:02:13.060> okay<00:02:14.060> it's

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
it and then to the other side okay it's

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.510 
it and then to the other side okay it's
important<00:02:14.780> here<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.260> if<00:02:15.739> there<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.340> some

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
important here that if there is some

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.890 
important here that if there is some
rotation<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> body<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.720> it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
rotation of the body that it's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.140 
rotation of the body that it's
controlled<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.980> maintaining<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.730> neutral

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
controlled so maintaining this neutral

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:32.319 
controlled so maintaining this neutral
lumbar<00:02:20.480> spine<00:02:20.720> position

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.800 

so<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.510> series<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.959> exercises<00:02:34.670> represents

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
so this series of exercises represents

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.420 
so this series of exercises represents
cost<00:02:36.810> ability<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.469> the<00:02:37.560> sitting<00:02:37.859> position<00:02:38.010> on

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
cost ability in the sitting position on

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.030
