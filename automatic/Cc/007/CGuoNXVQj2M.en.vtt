00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.899
 there are good to all those commenting and 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.120
 from a modern warfare gameplay 3 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.580
 today I bring you a pretty good game 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 in a team match and the truth is that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.950
 good mate a lot of stuff not us what 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.710
 I'm going to say because then you cheat me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.560
 matte enough to say let 's leave it 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.000
 the result was how I tell you too much 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.010
 bulky for what really was the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 departure but you will not see that at 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.910
 principle used everything except m-14 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.340
 especially a game with the magnum and 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.199
 let's say I 'm going to use the background 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.610
 because I come to talk about that as I already 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.149
 you know all of you who follow me in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.899
 twitter the other day on Saturday I was with 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.680
 Richard Richards indeed Richard 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.379
 finally but good rose Madrid I was 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.629
 with him we went to eat and dart is that it was 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.489
 a pass to all those that I imagine 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.640
 that you know you have richard was the reason 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.280
 why I started uploading gameplays 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 commented was the best person who 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.510
 sincerely known inside youtube 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.520
 It was more than two years ago that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 that I knew her that I met her flew to the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.560
 person is to say that you know him and better 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.409
 said sorry richard makes more than two 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.569
 years that I knew him and the truth is that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.389
 as I tell you I will never have the 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.789
 opportunity to meet you shimano knew 

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:20.189
 a lot of youtube is to all the 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.990
 world practically everyone who 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.840
 they live here in spain I knew them but 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.249
 however , he was the only person without 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.630
 But the one that I most wanted was 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.990
 know 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.880
 so however I had never had 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.029
 the opportunity as I tell you to know him 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.770
 and it was really amazing to see that 

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.409
 not only knowing someone with the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.709
 that you've been talking about for years because 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.549
 they are practically two years, that is, 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.049
 just that but also just catch and 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.989
 see that through youtube you have not 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.299
 known someone like you say oysters 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:02:00.299
 not only richard but have 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.119
 known to a lot of people is to say to 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.859
 everyone with whom you are day to day people 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.370
 I will not mention anyone because then 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.350
 I piss 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.460
 of some and they 're going to kill me but well 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.300
 you have seen the source world with which 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.800
 I make videos all youtube people 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.690

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.270
 that is all this if it is not through 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.510
 youtube I would not have known anyone 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.830
 that is, I would not have known alex for 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.590
 example someone with whom you can catch 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.260
 and fit perfectly any day is 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.200
 say a lot of people that I do not 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.160
 I had never contacted 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.500
 levels had the opportunity to meet you 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.660
 not then all those people that what 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.480
 better says waste care with the internet and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.300
 other man is very clear but it is not 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 let's say that I personally from my 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.950
 point of view come on I have to give you the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.870
 thanks to internet youtube or as 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.850
 you want to call him because how good he got 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.280
 Saturday I was with richard and when 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.080
 he administered álex and bartolo álex 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.970
 I knew was the first person that 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.710
 I really knew him I knew him from before 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.720
 start on youtube in fact was to use 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.190
 come start commenting on videos to me 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.650
 I had said it 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.350
 richard arrange richards I said alex and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.690
 well there we went to comment all 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.040
 the videos and the truth is that it was a 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 pass 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.390
 so far if anyone sees the first 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.670
 commented gameplay that I have on the channel 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.049
 that would give me enough to allow I do not know 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.720
 as richard said yes yes yes we are going to 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.370
 make us 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.100
 I told him I'm going to do for both 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.080
 together and so on and he said yes yes yes no 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.230
 problem and there was not listening yet nor 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.150
 not my voice or anything and I said and oysters 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.470
 well, it starts to comment and I do not know 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.110
 as he said he did not say today the ine 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.760
 300 boy, you are not worth for this because 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.410
 with laughter voice no more anywhere 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 say it you know but I for example 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.360
 when I had to start commenting 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.489
 videos that was made to us came two years ago 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.030
 practically September is going to 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.170
 two years ago and the truth is that it has 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.350
 to comment on the videos or because I had 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.760
 let's say a game to play that 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.080
 it was in the morning that is to say I woke up 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.400
 and you wanted to play you had to wake up what 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.470
 better at 7 in the morning to play 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.760
 a game because the rest of the day 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.920
 I had to be studying I had to 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.420
 be doing my things effectively and 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.239
 well, a monkey put me to bed very late 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.280
 because the truth is that I got bored 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.360
 quite the television I was taking I was going to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.489
 sleep I wake up in the morning 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.410
 I was studying if I did not have to 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.090
 study then before going to class because 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.890
 they could play a game not the only 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.770
 that moment they had a game to 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.379
 play a couple of games then 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.389
 I took and it was when I had my only 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.879
 moment to comment is to say if I wanted 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.169
 play or comment any game had 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.430
 to be in the morning then 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.199
 obviously when you wake up by the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.569
 tomorrow is not that you have the best of your 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.240
 voices and that was the reason why I 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.220
 firm do not replace they were like very let's say 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.950
 that spoke pretty weird let's say 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.860
 let's leave it that way and the truth is that 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.450
 I do not know, it was quite strange 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.000
 after being talking and so much desire 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.380
 to see someone like for example to 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.920
 richard that the best will look super 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.740
 absurd but honestly I do not know 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.900
 is something is nothing something that yes 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.310
 it really matters after being like you 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.690
 I say there is a lot of time talking to 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.880
 someone who had known lots of 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.190
 people and especially to the most 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.220
 special that you know inside youtube 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.900
 and that's why from the beginning 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.250
 Many people have asked why you have 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.240
 you have richard there always a 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.930
 description all videos 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.570
 because as I say 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.009
 I have always been taught since I was little 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.190
 we know what we think has exceeded but 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.710
 weird but there's a saying that says it's 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.050
 of well-born being grateful not 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.000
 so 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.490
 It was already richard who put me in 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.139
 this world everything I've got 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.819
 it was thanks to him he took and started 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.159
 encourage me with all this and if it had been 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.110
 for him I would not be here today so I 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.330
 of all those things do not forget me or of 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.789
 nothing either for good or bad 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.050
 everyone that has helped me all I 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.510
 agreement perfectly take me well 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.990
 right now with them but let's say that 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.820
 As I say, you never have to turn your back 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.730
 deny anyone or anything 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.280
 It is in possession of a hand helped give 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.890
 let's just say that you always have to 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.910
 take it into account and well that's 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.410
 practically what I've done with 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.690
 richard in each and every one of the 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.790
 videos that I have despite not having 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.710
 no agreement or anything agreed, that is to say 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.630
 no water, we put each other 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.550
 in the description and others not just 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.990
 It is something that really comes out 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.520
 inside then when we make videos 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:32.490
 together really is when that comes out 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.160
 you see that there are a lot of very good 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.710
 relationship we had a great time with 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.290
 two normal friends and so 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.930
 nothing simply I hope not to have you 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.660
 bored I hope you liked the 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.780
 gameplay and I hope you've seen how 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.430
 it swells up our weems 6 hair and that's why 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.830
 he said that the result quite bulky 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.330
 so I do not expect anything that has served you 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.950
 that you liked that you vote the video 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.950
 I like favorite looks of the next
