00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.769 
hi I'm Gary heffel and we're talking
about<00:00:05.190> building<00:00:05.700> an<00:00:06.029> insect<00:00:06.390> collection

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
about building an insect collection

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.140 
about building an insect collection
today<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.350> wanted<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> talk<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.760> right<00:00:09.090> now

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
today I wanted to talk to right now

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.330 
today I wanted to talk to right now
about<00:00:09.450> labeling<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.320> identification<00:00:10.800> of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
about labeling and identification of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.209 
about labeling and identification of
species<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.389> might<00:00:12.570> collect<00:00:12.889> we<00:00:13.889> can

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
species that you might collect we can

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.870 
species that you might collect we can
use<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:14.910> example<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.929> box<00:00:16.880> let's

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
use this as an example in this box let's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.660 
use this as an example in this box let's
choose<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.480> akuma<00:00:19.050> na<00:00:19.109> spear<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.160> wasp

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
choose the akuma na spear it's a wasp

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.259 
choose the akuma na spear it's a wasp
that<00:00:20.880> has<00:00:21.180> very<00:00:21.660> long<00:00:22.580> ovipositor<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.119> that

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
that has very long ovipositor so that

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.400 
that has very long ovipositor so that
makes<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.689> female<00:00:25.080> wasp<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:27.410> label

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
makes it a female wasp and the label

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.700 
makes it a female wasp and the label
underneath<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.320> concentrating

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
underneath is what we are concentrating

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.930 
underneath is what we are concentrating
on<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:32.899> information<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.710> an<00:00:35.280> insect

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
on now information that is on an insect

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.709 
on now information that is on an insect
label<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.620> basically<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.300> locality<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.390> far

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
label is basically the locality as far

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.720 
label is basically the locality as far
down<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.520> case<00:00:41.700> of

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
down as you can get it in the case of

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
down as you can get it in the case of
where<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> live<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.600> four<00:00:42.840> miles<00:00:43.079> southwest

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
where I live it's four miles southwest

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.959 
where I live it's four miles southwest
of<00:00:44.040> Ashton<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> four<00:00:46.200> miles<00:00:46.530> abbreviated<00:00:47.219> SW<00:00:47.940> a

of Ashton so four miles abbreviated SW a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.319 
of Ashton so four miles abbreviated SW a
period<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.750> action<00:00:49.739> would<00:00:50.160> work<00:00:50.340> fine<00:00:50.610> then

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
period of action would work fine then

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.560 
period of action would work fine then
the<00:00:51.690> date<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> collector<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the date and then the collector this is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
the date and then the collector this is
the<00:00:54.719> essential<00:00:55.170> information<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.800> allows<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the essential information that allows a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.880 
the essential information that allows a
person<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> future<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> notes<00:00:58.620> or

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
person in the future to go to notes or

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
person in the future to go to notes or
find<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.570> back<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
find out if they want to go back and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
find out if they want to go back and
look<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.350> same<00:01:01.649> neighborhood<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
look in the same neighborhood for this

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
look in the same neighborhood for this
that<00:01:03.539> might<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.049> insect<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> might<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that might this insect it might be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
that might this insect it might be
unique<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.180> interesting<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.110> them

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
unique and interesting to them

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.520 
unique and interesting to them
biological<00:01:08.070> also<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
biological also they can go back to that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
biological also they can go back to that
same<00:01:10.799> locality<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> essential

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
same locality so that's the essential

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.890 
same locality so that's the essential
information<00:01:13.350> sometimes<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.340> person<00:01:14.900> has

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
information sometimes a person has

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.359 
information sometimes a person has
enough<00:01:16.290> information<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.220> was

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
enough information if it was

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
enough information if it was
parasitizing<00:01:18.270> something<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.869> particular<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
parasitizing something in particular to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.710 
parasitizing something in particular to
put<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> second<00:01:20.340> label<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.150> shaft<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
put a second label on the shaft of the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.560 
put a second label on the shaft of the
pin<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.939> basically<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
pin so that's basically it and the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.200 
pin so that's basically it and the
person<00:01:27.570> who<00:01:27.869> identifies<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.619> later<00:01:29.210> often

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
person who identifies it later often

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.590 
person who identifies it later often
puts<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.630> another<00:01:31.530> label<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.460> beneath<00:01:33.119> giving

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
puts a another label on beneath giving

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.539 
puts a another label on beneath giving
the<00:01:33.720> scientific<00:01:34.350> name<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> insect<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the scientific name of the insect and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.660 
the scientific name of the insect and

to start an insect collection and I

to start an insect collection and I
think<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.790> should<00:03:41.970> just<00:03:42.000> go<00:03:42.630> out<00:03:42.810> into<00:03:42.989> the

think you should just go out into the

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.289 
think you should just go out into the
field<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.530> do<00:03:43.829> your<00:03:44.010> thing<00:03:44.280> find<00:03:44.760> out<00:03:44.940> learn

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
to pin insects and do that you can

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.180 
to pin insects and do that you can
photograph<00:03:51.420> them<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.530> illustrate<00:03:52.709> them

photograph them you can illustrate them
you<00:03:53.489> can<00:03:53.670> observe<00:03:53.970> their<00:03:54.390> biology<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:54.989> make
