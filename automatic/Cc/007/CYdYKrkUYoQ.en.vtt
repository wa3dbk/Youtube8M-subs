just like our navigation we tried very

believable terrain here you'll see that

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.670 
believable terrain here you'll see that
the<00:05:17.669> environment<00:05:18.300> self<00:05:18.479> is<00:05:18.570> not<00:05:18.600> greeted<00:05:19.139> that

the environment self is not greeted that
Connor<00:05:20.160> is<00:05:20.310> able<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.669> grab<00:05:20.910> on<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.270> all<00:05:21.600> kinds

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
Connor is able to grab on to all kinds

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.629 
Connor is able to grab on to all kinds
of<00:05:21.930> different<00:05:22.080> shapes<00:05:22.500> which<00:05:23.250> we<00:05:23.370> think<00:05:23.490> is

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
of different shapes which we think is

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.400 
of different shapes which we think is
particularly<00:05:23.970> special<00:05:24.330> in<00:05:24.870> an<00:05:25.020> open<00:05:25.289> world

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
particularly special in an open world

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:33.510 
particularly special in an open world
context

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.309 

this<00:05:34.150> is<00:05:34.240> one<00:05:34.360> of<00:05:34.449> three<00:05:34.720> ways<00:05:34.960> into<00:05:35.229> this

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
this is one of three ways into this

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.080 
this is one of three ways into this
particular<00:05:35.680> fort<00:05:36.160> it's<00:05:36.340> sort<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:36.729> stealth

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:58.900 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth
path<00:05:37.870> at<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.349> rear

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.640 

so<00:05:59.480> black<00:05:59.690> powder<00:05:59.930> is<00:06:00.110> not<00:06:00.230> just<00:06:00.380> a<00:06:00.470> key

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
so black powder is not just a key

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.290 
so black powder is not just a key
historical<00:06:00.800> resource<00:06:01.670> you<00:06:01.850> can<00:06:01.880> see<00:06:02.090> it<00:06:02.180> being

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
historical resource you can see it being

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.640 
historical resource you can see it being
loaded<00:06:02.540> there<00:06:03.220> into<00:06:04.220> that<00:06:04.370> cabin<00:06:05.500> but<00:06:06.500> also

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
loaded there into that cabin but also

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.770 
loaded there into that cabin but also
gave<00:06:06.890> us<00:06:06.980> an<00:06:07.040> opportunity<00:06:07.130> to<00:06:07.600> include<00:06:08.600> some

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
gave us an opportunity to include some

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:18.640 
gave us an opportunity to include some
historical<00:06:09.290> exploding<00:06:10.280> barrels<00:06:17.380> so<00:06:18.380> nothing

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
historical exploding barrels so nothing

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.930 
historical exploding barrels so nothing
we<00:06:18.740> invested<00:06:19.040> heavily<00:06:19.190> in<00:06:19.400> is<00:06:19.580> this<00:06:19.670> notion

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
we invested heavily in is this notion

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.690 
we invested heavily in is this notion
that<00:06:20.180> Connor<00:06:20.420> is<00:06:20.690> always<00:06:21.590> on<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:21.770> move<00:06:22.010> I<00:06:22.340> we

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
that Connor is always on the move I we

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.000 
that Connor is always on the move I we
gave<00:06:22.790> him<00:06:22.910> a<00:06:22.940> bunch<00:06:23.150> of<00:06:23.240> new<00:06:23.510> abilities<00:06:24.440> such

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.770 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such
as<00:06:25.040> running<00:06:25.370> assassinate<00:06:26.000> so<00:06:26.390> here<00:06:26.630> is<00:06:26.720> he

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
as running assassinate so here is he

as running assassinate so here is he
chases<00:06:27.170> Silas<00:06:27.530> you<00:06:27.650> can<00:06:27.800> assassinate<00:06:28.040> this
