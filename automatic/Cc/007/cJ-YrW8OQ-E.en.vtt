 equivalent to 25 chihuahua 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.630
 the Tibetan mastiff 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.660

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.229
 any threat 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.449
 when they were used as dogs 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.350
 guardians were entrusted with custody 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.350
 of entire villages 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.640
 a job that the Tibetan mastiff comes 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.200
 realizing from ancient times when 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.060
 their ancestors lived with the tribes 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.869
 nomads on the high slopes and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.869
 valleys of the himalayas 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.590
 some of these strong dogs that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.200
 they intimidated so much they were taken to the west 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.090
 of Europe at the request of Attila the Hun and his 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.100
 progeny of origin to modern fats 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.290
 of molossian dogs among them 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 Mastiffs the boxer and it 's really 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 they are valued not only for their huge 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.790
 size but also for its impressive 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.790
 bark 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.759
 [Applause] 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.619
 and the source of his powerful voice is 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.470
 found in the larynx that houses 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.940
 vocal cords those strings contract 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.920
 while the lungs carry the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.200
 air along the larynx the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.640
 strings vibrate at high speed and so 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.440
 they produce the barks 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.060
 the biggest dogs have ropes 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.520
 Longer vowels and lungs more 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.690
 great is why his barks are 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.690
 deeper and more sonorous 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.640
 [Music] 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.709
 after hearing that thunderous sound 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.000
 the second that is seen in a mastiff 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.000
 Tibetan is his strong build 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.730
 muscle those muscles give you strength 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.739
 what you need for your barks 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.440
 has a hairy tail that curves 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.840
 lean on the back and its double coat 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.299
 long and thick is particularly dense 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.920
 in the neck and shoulders that gives 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.380
 an aspect similar to the mane of 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.950
 a lion 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.560

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.239
 its large and impressive body attracted 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.099
 the attention of the most populous country in the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.099
 Chinese world 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.880
 is a new and surprising trend in 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.520
 a country that was having dogs 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.230
 forbidden 50 years ago but today the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.570
 Tibetan mastiff leads the revolution 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.640
 canine for those lands during the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.080
 last 20 years while the middle class 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.120
 China went from poverty to 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.070
 Prosperity also emerged legions 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.630

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.390
 best exponents of the race 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.920
 today in modern china have a mastiff 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.760
 Tibetan is the greatest symbol of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.490
 prestige a large and elegant house and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.050
 a big and fierce Tibetan mastiff that's 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.420
 what it takes to be rich and 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.040
 famous in fact there was a dog that 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.129
 sold for almost 600 thousand dollars in china 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.980
 very good karma and a man followed his 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.730
 meteoric rise from the beginning if 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.950
 he is karma 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.470
 He is the first male we import 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.360
 Dr. Andrew Wang is American 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.310
 but he was born in China and he's a fan of 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.739
 Tibetan mastiffs for more than 20 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.890
 years actually from the first time 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.140

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.110
 smart and the perfect guardians 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.120
 collins its mission is to collaborate with the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.310
 transition of the Tibetan mastiff from its 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.050
 passed as fierce guardian dog up 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.970
 your present as a family pet 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.660
 modern and promote the methods 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.120
 adequate foster care 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.840
 today he heads to china where the culture 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.000
 canina is still enriched 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.030
 during this trip I would like to visit 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.370
 my friends from sian and also meet 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.650
 new people 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.389
 and Western innovations like the 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.760
 genetic scans and records of 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.229
 pedigrees are not yet so common here and 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.810
 that becomes a problem for 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.160
 this race suddenly so beloved like this 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.720
 that Andrew will meet with several 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.800
 Chinese breeders to encourage them to 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.389
 adopt these new techniques in a 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.229
 mastiff farm on the outskirts of 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.639
 beijing 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.889
 Andrew met one of the few 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.979
 creatures of this race of the country the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.250
 Mrs. Jiang and you could have a look at them 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.680
 some of your best mastiffs are you 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.550

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.350
 wide per day 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.259
 these personal encounters are 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.000
 fundamental to convince their 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.750
 colleagues participate in the records 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.750
 international 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.910
 if you did, it would pave the way for 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.070
 any future cooperation between 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.920
 American and Chinese breeders and 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.290
 Andrew managed to make a good impression 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.330
 we want to learn from your culture of your 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.850
 experience in raising dogs and 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.920
 everything they do to preserve them another 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.500
 which he told me that excited me 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.970
 quite is that more and more people are 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.070
 they realize the importance of 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.420
 analysis of the health problems of 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.490
 Tibetan mastiffs 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.590
 they are very valuable prestige symbols 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.720
 in China although it is still rare 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.990
 see these huge animals as pets 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.120
 relatives 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.770
 but in the rural suburbs of beijing 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.110
 that's exactly what the 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.850
 mastiffs of the ko family 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.630
 the children adopted the mastiffs 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.460
 Tibetans were very good they 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.560
 they grew up when they have time 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.170
 they feed they play with them and they walk them 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.690
 I am also happy because the 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.820
 children are very innocent have fun 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.940
 a lot and I taught them to love the 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.940
 animals 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.170
 for Andrew that is the goal of the trip 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.600
 help the Tibetan mastiffs 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.070
 survive their new fame and occupy a 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.150
 place in Chinese society as the 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.830
 pets that he knows he can do the 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.170
 Tibetan mastiff lives best in climates 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.160
 fresh and dry and how it protects with zeal 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.720
 his territory 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.390
 It is convenient that your home has a fence 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.090
 resistant and can suffer certain 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.260
 health problems like dysplasia of 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.420
 hips 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.330
 thyroid problems and infections in 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.160
 the ears the lower layer of hair is 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.080
 comes off almost completely in spring 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.720
 and fall so you need to brush 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.360
 frequent for about three weeks go 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.100
 to have the house full of hairs like 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.080
 belongs an independent race already 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.240
 often obstinate the Tibetan mastiff does not 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.099
 is for inexperienced owners 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.169
 He is very affectionate and protective with his 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.169
 family but suspicious of strangers 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.890
 so that you are healthy and comfortable you have to 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.550
 live in an environment with cool weather and 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.410
 dry 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.030
 this long- lived race can 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.190
 experience many of the problems of 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.390
 common health of large breeds and their 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.120
 fur and bone will require attention 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.770
 special during the molting seasons 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.390
 It is also important to make sure that 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.610
 have social experiences since very 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.470
 small but if you devote time and 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.580
 attention your Tibetan mastiff the 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.910
 reward with loyalty 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.739
 unwavering
