I have gotten better bipolarism when I

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.560 
I have gotten better bipolarism when I
get<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:41.710> diet<00:00:42.070> stage<00:00:42.489> where<00:00:42.880> I'm<00:00:43.180> very

carb depleted but what I am finding out

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.640 
carb depleted but what I am finding out
this<00:00:46.540> year<00:00:46.899> by<00:00:47.140> increasing<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.250> fat<00:00:48.490> intake

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
this year by increasing the fat intake

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.430 
this year by increasing the fat intake
and<00:00:51.630> it's<00:00:52.630> really<00:00:52.960> interesting<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:54.420> really

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and it's really interesting you really

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.850 
and it's really interesting you really
start<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.500> understand<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.880> importance<00:00:58.480> of

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
start to understand the importance of

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.530 
start to understand the importance of
carbohydrates<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.540> micronutrients

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
carbohydrates and micronutrients

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.630 
carbohydrates and micronutrients
relations<00:01:02.050> because<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.130> really<00:01:03.400> start

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
relations because you really start

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.320 
relations because you really start
finding<00:01:04.059> yourself<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.979> moody<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:07.030> start

I<00:01:14.060> think<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.270> relationship<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
I think in relationship to that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.410 
I think in relationship to that
audibility<00:01:18.090> has<00:01:19.080> gotten<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.620> point<00:01:19.950> that

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
audibility has gotten to a point that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.230 
audibility has gotten to a point that
it's<00:01:21.420> lost<00:01:21.840> its<00:01:22.230> health<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.280> Fitness<00:01:23.730> ratio
