00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.470
 all right 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.309
 we have an automated forklift 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.740
 consisting of the following elements 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.799
 we have positive and negative current 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.910
 continuous that would be the force circuit 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.910
 the motor 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.650
 left and right positive and negative 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.920
 also current condomina continuous the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.500
 other alternating current with my 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.599
 movement because it's the tension that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.199
 work the low coils 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:41.379
 and to upload this with is of the following 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.379
 way has two end of career 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:50.800
 normal open normal closed both and a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:54.520
 stop when the stop reaches down here 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.379
 Feeds the same by the color orange 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.379
 what would be the return 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:07.290
 forklifts that go up not before passing 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.650
 by the normal sawing of the coil 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.330
 contact that goes down and vice versa 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.750
 in green we have 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.910
 what feeds the driver's coil 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.690
 that goes down but before going through this 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.300
 closed normal contactor that goes up to 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.780
 what we call interlock that makes 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.300
 that none of the two counters enter 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.230
 at the same time inside one or between the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.210
 other 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.470
 this has no buttons and has no gear 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:45.590
 But we have done a march here 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.159
 n1 and n2 and a payment weights 2 and weights 1 but 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.380
 be inside 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.530
 the end of racing disconnection 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.159
 connection to home we stayed because it changes 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.789
 color changes the direction of rotation there 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.920
 a phase inversion then there 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.110
 we make the direction of rotation 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.069
 and we're going to see it work to see 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.580
 how it works in a workshop if we go 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.580
 Let's see 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.610
 well then we have here the 2 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.060
 contactors the two normal closed that 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.620
 we indicated earlier on the board 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.200
 and the direction of rotation 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.110
 as we can see 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.720
 the car is missing the forklift that 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.410
 it would be this but you can see that when 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.790
 come down 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.550
 immediately without having any kind of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.640
 keypad goes up and vice versa when it arrives 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.940
 up low then there we have a 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.690
 automated hoist in this case the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.810
 lift truck 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.760
 we can also do that is the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.670
 operating principle of a 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.710
 cheerleader is going backwards and when 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.480
 avanza removes the iron filings 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.670
 well this is the circuit of 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.670
 automated forklift
