00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.960
 low 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.309
 good today I'll teach you how to record 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.010
 minecraft without using flaps then I 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.589
 I think you all already know about the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 frap without moving all that so do not you 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.030
 I will teach about this or good if a 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 little if you have a computer 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.280
 very very slow I would recommend you that they will be 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.920
 30 fps but if your computer is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.530
 advanced then there as you want 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.189
 They could not put 60 fps and a full size 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.769
 but I would recommend here and at 30 fps to 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.569
 those of computers that are slow and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.610
 that have a ram memory or the 

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:12.570
 very bad graphics 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.820
 it could also be 29 points 97 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.510
 here in capture sound and all that 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.620
 here I would remind you to put outside 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.500
 although multichannel is to listen 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.110
 for players if they are recording in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 skype or something is to hear about 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 players on one side and for another player 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.659
 on the other hand and here in being and up 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.569
 listen to both of you on both sides 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.360
 here sometimes and you do not know how they have 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.380
 your pedal 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.290
 and what I want to give them with what they 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.030
 I want to teach how to remove the like from 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.860
 minecraft in 80% sure we will mark 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.840
 I already had it open of what I had 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.240
 open 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.149
 options and video settings then 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.580
 who adjust video where it says drilled 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:10.000
 performance here is not Wednesday 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.970
 I had it that way at the maximum for a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.510
 maximum fps I would recommend to the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.570
 that record minecraft and have a lot of 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.569
 recommended that they put it in bs 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:28.109
 and in that as well as how are they if without anything 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.560
 because because if they put it in maximum fps 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:34.439
 fps or as you want you are going to go very 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.020
 the guide then I recommended that 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:41.170
 opposition here in bs and nc in that yes yes 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.890
 how are you friend 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.800
 well that 's what I teach and all this 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.569
 I have it like that by default, good for 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.420
 defect the prior moved him if I do not know what 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.670
 what face derbies here own him 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.820
 I would recommend that now 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.280
 but they put in here as well as stays 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.310
 and that I have a quick here in 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.880
 render distance I have in the shortest 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.880
 16 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.260
 the lighting over I have it in 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.860
 I have the normal interface scale in 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.010
 obviously bright shine for 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.549
 that looks better 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.799
 I have no off in details to find 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:30.430
 here focus start is at 0 points 0.4 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.200
 and I put it in 0.2 and at the time of 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.910
 govern are paid 0.4 I do not know why 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.430
 Well, that's all I wanted 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.080
 teach and I hope it has helped them in 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.900
 something if you have any questions or something 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.790
 said comment on the video and so see if 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.690
 I can help you a little good that's 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.930
