aircraft type but they're also going to
fly<00:02:33.680> only<00:02:33.800> one<00:02:34.040> cockpit<00:02:34.519> configuration<00:02:35.360> when

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
fly only one cockpit configuration when

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.300 
fly only one cockpit configuration when
we<00:02:35.720> spec<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.050> airplanes<00:02:36.440> out<00:02:36.680> respect<00:02:37.220> them

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
we spec the airplanes out respect them

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.460 
we spec the airplanes out respect them
out<00:02:37.400> exactly<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> same<00:02:38.180> by<00:02:38.840> aircraft<00:02:39.019> type

out exactly the same by aircraft type
it's<00:02:39.769> excellent<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.700> pilots<00:02:41.060> because

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
it's excellent for the pilots because

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.360 
it's excellent for the pilots because
