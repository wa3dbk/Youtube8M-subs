00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.240
 to me 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.810
 Exercise routine to increase mass 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.419
 muscular half-hour weight at the gym 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.910
 two or three days a week is not the most 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.949
 advisable if you want to see results and 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 neither does it need to go all the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.030
 days of two to three hours with him four 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.699
 days a week leaving a day of 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.729
 half the rest is enough and with 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.070
 spend an hour and a half is enough in 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.050
 That day in between we can dedicate ourselves 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.760
 to work the legs since we should not 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.710
 work the muscles of the part 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.019
 upper body more than two days 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.969
 followed by what the third should 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.730
 rest or work the bottom 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.800
 of the body 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.079
 when you go to the gym and do your 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 Weighing routine you should be focused on 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.489
 do your routine the exercises and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.530
 breaks as many people when going to 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.020
 feel the whole training session 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.909
 chatting and being distracted by what 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.250
 ends up spending more time in the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.890
 gym and do not get results 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.510
 in the gym you should not throw yourself all 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.490
 time in the machine zone but 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.770
 also that of dumbbells and bars since 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.900
 they are more effective because an exercise 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.000
 performed on a machine you do not have to 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.500
 stabilize the weights and instead with 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.930
 the bars if they should keep the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.060
 balance of the bar so you do not get 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.490
 go for a side so you work 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.200
 more muscles and work them better with 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.900
 the bars and dumbbells that with the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.030
 machines in addition to that with machines 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.100
 we end up making more strength with a 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.690
 arm that with the other in exchange for the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.590
 another way the two arms work 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.659
 same 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.640
 It should be your first series of 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.500
 surveys do a few repetitions 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.719
 pulling with little weight so that it 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.030
 warm your muscles since there are many 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.369
 people who just arrived at the gym 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.250
 they are put with a bar machine or 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
 dumbbells with too much weight so they 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.860
 many of them end up suffering 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.320
 muscle injuries or discomfort 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.270
 in our weightlifting routine we should not 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.880
 spend with our exercises and 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.470
 series so the advisable thing is that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.350
 when we work the big muscles 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.360
 like the chest shoulders or quadriceps 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.270
 let's do four to five exercises 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.120
 maximum per muscle with its three series 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.850
 if we do five or four exercises 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.710
 series and we did four exercises and 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.770
 with a small muscle like biceps 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.380
 triceps or twins we should do maximum 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.910
 about three or four exercises with their 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.160
 three series and we made four 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.290
 exercises or four series and we perform 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.660
 three exercises because if we do not pass 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.820
 we will be burning the muscle so 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.459
 we will not have muscular gains and not 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.560
 we will get results we must wait 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.810
 about four days at least to be able 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.640
 repeat and work the same muscle 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.430
