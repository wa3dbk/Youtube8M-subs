00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
therefore I do not believe he was

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.569 
therefore I do not believe he was

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
claims so was Jesus delusional

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.250

if<00:04:26.550> Jesus<00:04:26.850> really<00:04:27.300> believed<00:04:27.600> he<00:04:27.780> was<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.050> son

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
if Jesus really believed he was the son

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.790 
if Jesus really believed he was the son
of<00:04:28.290> God

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
of God

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.500 
of God
and<00:04:28.890> believed<00:04:29.520> he<00:04:29.640> was<00:04:29.850> as<00:04:30.000> some<00:04:30.120> magical

powers he was delusional
this<00:04:33.120> seems<00:04:33.390> likely<00:04:33.630> because<00:04:34.020> Jesus<00:04:34.380> was

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
this seems likely because Jesus was

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.070 
this seems likely because Jesus was
willing<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.890> die<00:04:35.130> for<00:04:35.160> his<00:04:35.550> beliefs<00:04:36.080> although
