give us their medicine and their message

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.340 
give us their medicine and their message
in<00:04:10.100> those<00:04:10.640> three<00:04:10.940> different<00:04:11.330> modalities<00:04:11.990> very

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
in those three different modalities very

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.650 
in those three different modalities very
well<00:04:12.620> because<00:04:13.310> misting<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> washing<00:04:14.540> and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
well because misting is a washing and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.500 
well because misting is a washing and
clearing<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:16.430> straight<00:04:16.760> oil<00:04:17.000> gives<00:04:17.269> us<00:04:17.420> a

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
clearing and the straight oil gives us a

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.020 
clearing and the straight oil gives us a
powerful<00:04:18.140> inhalation<00:04:18.890> we<00:04:19.430> can<00:04:19.609> carry<00:04:19.880> the

those three gates are main ways to get
in<00:04:44.030> there<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.390> help<00:04:44.510> us<00:04:44.900> shift<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:46.250> it's<00:04:46.490> very

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
in there and help us shift so it's very

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.870 
in there and help us shift so it's very
easy<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:47.240> start<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.810> way<00:04:48.050> with<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.010> mist<00:04:49.400> for
