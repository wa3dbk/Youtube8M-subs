winter we can start by cleaning your EFI
system<00:00:20.880> all<00:00:21.390> right<00:00:21.449> that's<00:00:21.869> great<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.350> what

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
system all right that's great but what

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.859 
system all right that's great but what
is<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.250> fi<00:00:23.460> system<00:00:23.939> yep<00:00:24.240> our<00:00:24.420> stands<00:00:24.660> for

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
is it a fi system yep our stands for

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.120 
is it a fi system yep our stands for

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
and it gives you better why you burning

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.160 
and it gives you better why you burning
it<00:00:39.329> off<00:00:39.420> better<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:39.960> better<00:00:40.110> fuel

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it off better you get better fuel

come<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> screen<00:00:43.430> okay<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.879> doesn't<00:00:45.450> burn

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
come on the screen okay it doesn't burn

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.150 
come on the screen okay it doesn't burn
off<00:00:45.870> price<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> waste<00:00:46.440> fuel<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.950> caused

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
off price you waste fuel that caused

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.470 
off price you waste fuel that caused
sick<00:00:47.430> cause<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.059> money<00:00:48.210> along

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
sick cause you to more money along

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.940 
sick cause you to more money along
alright<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> system<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
alright and that's because the system is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.150 
alright and that's because the system is
dirty<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.670> why<00:00:51.059> does<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> system<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.870> dirty

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
dirty so why does the system get dirty

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.889 
dirty so why does the system get dirty
just<00:00:53.160> normal<00:00:53.460> running<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> vehicle<00:00:54.629> where

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
fuel is inherently dirty it actually

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
fuel is inherently dirty it actually

question<00:01:01.980> genuine<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> engine<00:01:02.670> okay<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
question genuine of the engine okay I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
question genuine of the engine okay I
get<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> how<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.500> would<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.799> clean<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
get that how then would I clean the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
get that how then would I clean the
system<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.090> should<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.479> pressurized

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
system it should be a pressurized

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.890 
system it should be a pressurized
cleaner<00:01:07.820> applied<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> engine<00:01:09.360> says<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
cleaner applied to the engine says for a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.390 
cleaner applied to the engine says for a
special<00:01:10.229> vitamin<00:01:10.530> system<00:01:10.830> okay<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.250> not

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
special vitamin system okay it's not

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.590 
special vitamin system okay it's not
something<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> myself<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.420> no<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
something I can do myself and no I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.450 
something I can do myself and no I
shouldn't<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.650> how<00:01:13.890> often<00:01:14.280> does<00:01:14.369> this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
shouldn't all right how often does this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.520 
shouldn't all right how often does this
need<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.820> clean<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:16.200> should<00:01:16.350> check<00:01:16.500> with

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
need to be clean I you should check with

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280 
need to be clean I you should check with
your<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:17.400> manufacturer<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.840> sure<00:01:19.020> what

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
your your manufacturer to make sure what

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.080 
your your manufacturer to make sure what
the<00:01:19.380> manager<00:01:19.710> may<00:01:19.830> need<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> schedule<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.880> for

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the manager may need to schedule is for

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.460 
the manager may need to schedule is for
the<00:01:21.180> fuel<00:01:21.390> injectors<00:01:21.720> okay<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.350> there

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the fuel injectors okay but are there

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.510 
the fuel injectors okay but are there
any<00:01:22.560> signs<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> maybe<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.220> might<00:01:23.369> have

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
any signs that maybe they might have

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.580 
any signs that maybe they might have
some<00:01:23.700> problems<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.330> system<00:01:24.689> uh<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
some problems of my system uh if you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.840 
some problems of my system uh if you
notice<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.950> robbed<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> engine<00:01:26.460> running<00:01:26.670> rough

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
notice I robbed the engine running rough

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510 
notice I robbed the engine running rough
burning<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:27.840> fuel<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.530> heart<00:01:28.890> starts<00:01:29.250> it'd

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
burning more fuel or heart starts it'd

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
burning more fuel or heart starts it'd
be<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> good<00:01:29.759> sign<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.420> fuel<00:01:30.600> injection

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
be a good sign that your fuel injection

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
be a good sign that your fuel injection
system<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.259> getting<00:01:31.439> dirty<00:01:31.650> alright<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
system is getting dirty alright so if I
