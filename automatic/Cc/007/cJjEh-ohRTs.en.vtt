00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.330
 hey people come to my new video 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.490
 that here is a desire video from a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.539
 spectator wanted to hear it 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.920
 how the sound of various cameras with 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.779
 the original microphone in the car pimple 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.519
 that means I have three here 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.810
 I'm now set up 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.030
 by times the construction 1 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.610
 that will be the canon eos 7d the sole 57 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.420
 and the sony ericsson 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 All three cameras have relatively good ones 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 own built-in microphones and I have 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 now with all cameras the car pimple 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.030
 that is set in the head without 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.250
 automatically adjust their sound and 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.870
 while quite a problem-the so-called the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.610
 so-called own noise 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.579
 this has to do with the fact that the cameras 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.550
 tower-high if automatically 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.589
 bowl and produce a certain amount 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.560
 I have all cameras all 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.350
 sound film shut off wind fields and the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.770
 filters everything and all cameras 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.330
 are in the program automatic 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 we still have a lawyer looks something like this 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.720
 out 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.290
 All cameras are the same distance from me 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 away 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 currently two and a half meters and now 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.049
 I make every camera dazzles each 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.880
 single camera through i have here now 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.770
 with the water small or similar 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.450
 no effort no 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.119
 i just have the video image 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.400
 but manually focuses on the grain 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.220
 and let's just start with that 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.740
 canon eos 700 de an 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.470
 that is the full program automatic and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.479
 that's the sound of the canon eos 700 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
 de on if I have something in the camera 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.240
 A spokesman now interested in that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.050
 in user more like that sounds when 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.190
 the camera virtually no sound 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.930
 that means I will now 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.810
 Just to speak and we 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.310
 look how far the noise level 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:13.970
 so I just go now 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:16.370
 quiet and so you could you one 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.920
 do not make picture of your own noise 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.750
 again a little tip used here 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.430
 headphones in this video or do you have 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.480
 the best sound results can be 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.230
 comparative get from same 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.820
 we immediately to the a57 that it is the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.160
 video pictures a 57 in the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.460
 program automatic detected focus 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.800
 and so the sound of the a57 sounds 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.100
 Again, the same game as 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.660
 Try out what the a57 does when 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.120
 I just now 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.430
 Well, silence in the room generation times 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.140
 look how high the level screwed 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.970
 and how strong your own noise 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.330
 is strengthened so again here 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.330
 silence 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.300
 and you too could you first 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.840
 a little taste of your own 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.680
 noise of the a57 make the sound and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.210
 Now I come to the sony ericsson what 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.800
 I once suspected the sound here 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.570
 probably the favorite because with the 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.700
 the best microphones installed 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.430
 in my opinion and also here hear 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.790
 now in the sound of the x10 of the picture too of 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.740
 the x10 automatic no white balance can 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.620
 nothing was just the focus of mine 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.690
 noted so here is the sound though 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.770
 I normally speak to two meters 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.270
 remove fifty 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.740
 and now let's see how those are 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:46.530
 Camera behaves if I just now 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:50.190
 Let it wash silently so that who 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.990
 So now the nx10 at no 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.300
 So you have been noisy 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.940
 again camera which match out 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.280
 how much to what extent is that interesting 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.140
 You can also see this result 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.750
 external applied microphones 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.460
 the cameras transmit with the internal 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.500
 Microphones very strong noise 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.080
 Rauschen usually with external 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.760
 applied microphones very strong one 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.970
 Although this noise can minimize 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.760
 by at various palace to the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.250
 level of the tone down here takes one 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.160
 small exception with the a 57 is that 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.100
 not possible remains firmly in the eye 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.419
 we can not do anything level like that 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.580
 I hope the driver with 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.560
 answer and you have those with one 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.840
 small comparison of the internal microphones 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.280
 get these three cameras and say 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.540
 bye until next time 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.540
 he likes on youtube
