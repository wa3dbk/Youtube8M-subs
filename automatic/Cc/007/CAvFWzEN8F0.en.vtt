00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
thing I'm going to show you how we can

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
thing I'm going to show you how we can
look<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> control<00:00:25.920> tree<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
look at the control tree because as you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.660 
look at the control tree because as you
know<00:00:27.599> when<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.500> deform<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.550> have

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
know when we will deform and we have

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
know when we will deform and we have
controls<00:00:30.210> within<00:00:30.420> controls<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> our<00:00:31.260> page<00:00:31.560> we

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
controls within controls on our page we

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.040 
controls within controls on our page we
have<00:00:32.099> some<00:00:32.430> type<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> three<00:00:33.030> structure<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
have some type of three structure that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.750 
have some type of three structure that
that<00:00:34.590> we're<00:00:34.739> looking<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.730> just

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that we're looking at and we can just

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.290 
that we're looking at and we can just
simply<00:00:36.300> look<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.260> how<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:38.300> this

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
simply look at how we can have this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.799 
simply look at how we can have this
control<00:00:39.780> tree<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> structure<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
control tree and the structure of it

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.450 
control tree and the structure of it
bye-bye<00:00:42.809> doing<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.200> trace<00:00:43.860> Inc<00:00:44.100> well<00:00:44.219> true<00:00:44.430> on

the<00:00:44.579> page<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.410> second<00:00:46.680> thing<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the page the second thing I'm going to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.760 
the page the second thing I'm going to
talk<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.030> ASP<00:00:48.539> label<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.649> how

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
talk about is the ASP label and see how

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.880 
talk about is the ASP label and see how
we<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.690> attribute<00:00:52.140> associated

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
we can have the the attribute associated

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.270 
we can have the the attribute associated
control<00:00:53.250> ID<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.600> associate<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.590> label<00:00:56.100> with

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
control ID to can associate a label with

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.819 
control ID to can associate a label with
for<00:00:57.030> example<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.480> text<00:00:57.750> box<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:58.739> be

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
for example a text box so that will be

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.700 
for example a text box so that will be
easier<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.250> them<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.660> screen<00:01:01.050> readers<00:01:01.410> for

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
easier for them for screen readers for

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
easier for them for screen readers for
for<00:01:02.280> blind<00:01:02.609> people<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
for blind people and things like that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.289 
for blind people and things like that
and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.189> third<00:01:05.489> thing<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and the third thing that I'm going to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.600 
and the third thing that I'm going to
talk<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> literal<00:01:07.890> control<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
talk about is the literal control and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.600 
talk about is the literal control and
I'm<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.780> many<00:01:10.080> ways<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> use<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I'm there are many ways we can use the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
I'm there are many ways we can use the
lateral<00:01:11.939> control<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:13.110> thing<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.530> need<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
lateral control one thing that I need to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
lateral control one thing that I need to
show<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.340> video<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
show you in this video is how we can

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
show you in this video is how we can
have<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.740> literal<00:01:17.130> control<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> title<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
have the literal control in the title so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
have the literal control in the title so
we<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:19.140> control<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.400> title

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we can have more control on the title

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.749 
we can have more control on the title
and<00:01:20.909> change<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> dynamically<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.549> page

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and change it dynamically as as our page

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.060 
and change it dynamically as as our page
is<00:01:23.939> running<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> first<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:25.740> done

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
is running so well the first thing done

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.690 
is running so well the first thing done
I<00:01:26.250> need<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.000> create<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.360> project

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
I need to create a project

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.240 
I need to create a project
then<00:01:28.939> see<00:01:29.450> how<00:01:29.570> we<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:29.869> view<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.710> control

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
then see how we can view the control

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.179 
then see how we can view the control
three<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.759> our<00:01:32.270> page<00:01:32.560> let's<00:01:33.560> go<00:01:33.740> ahead<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.100> get

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
three of our page let's go ahead and get

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.020 
three of our page let's go ahead and get
started<00:01:34.369> with<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.820> project<00:01:35.270> file<00:01:36.310> new<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.490> as

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
started with the project file new and as

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.510 
started with the project file new and as
I<00:01:38.149> discussed<00:01:38.570> with<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.840> before<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.469> most<00:01:40.369> of

item one

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.170 
item one
and<00:05:26.690> then<00:05:27.230> value<00:05:27.910> equals

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
and then value equals

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.310 
and then value equals
one

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.500 

let's<00:05:34.860> go<00:05:35.040> ahead<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.340> copy<00:05:35.520> all<00:05:35.670> that
