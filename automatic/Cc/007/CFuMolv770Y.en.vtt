become very interested in lately and I'm
going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.770> speaking<00:00:20.070> specifically<00:00:21.060> about

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
going to be speaking specifically about

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.440 
going to be speaking specifically about
standard<00:00:22.560> tuning<00:00:22.829> slide<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:24.270> means

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
standard tuning slide which just means

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.929 
standard tuning slide which just means
playing<00:00:25.489> slide<00:00:26.489> into<00:00:26.939> tuning<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:28.700> that<00:00:29.700> most

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
playing slide into tuning that that most

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.729 
playing slide into tuning that that most
books<00:00:30.360> would<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.809> you<00:00:30.960> tuned<00:00:31.169> to<00:00:31.380> initially

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
books would have you tuned to initially

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.020 
books would have you tuned to initially
it's<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.009> called<00:00:32.160> standard<00:00:32.640> tuning<00:00:32.790> for

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's just called standard tuning for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.300 
it's just called standard tuning for
guitar<00:00:33.270> which<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.540> e<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.960> D<00:00:34.860> G<00:00:35.430> B<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.120> E<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.310> so

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
guitar which is e a D G B and E and so

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.220 
guitar which is e a D G B and E and so
one<00:00:38.910> thing<00:00:39.120> about<00:00:39.420> slide<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.050> most

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
one thing about slide is that most

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.050 
one thing about slide is that most
players<00:00:40.500> tend<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> tune<00:00:41.220> to<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:41.490> open<00:00:41.790> tuning

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
players tend to tune to an open tuning

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.220 
players tend to tune to an open tuning
meaning<00:00:42.330> that<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:42.720> play<00:00:42.900> all<00:00:43.080> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
meaning that when they play all the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
meaning that when they play all the
strings<00:00:43.560> it<00:00:43.740> creates<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.220> chord<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
strings it creates a chord but when I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.540 
strings it creates a chord but when I
was<00:00:45.720> first<00:00:45.840> starting<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:47.190> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.490> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
was first starting at that was kind of a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.190 
was first starting at that was kind of a
scary<00:00:47.850> prospect<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.720> me<00:00:48.780> because<00:00:48.900> I<00:00:49.020> didn't

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
scary prospect to me because I didn't

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840 
scary prospect to me because I didn't
really<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.560> to<00:00:49.620> mess<00:00:49.770> around<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.400> too

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
really want to mess around up here too

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
really want to mess around up here too
much<00:00:51.060> because<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:52.050> kind<00:00:52.290> of<00:00:52.320> nervous

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
much because I was I was kind of nervous

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.110 
much because I was I was kind of nervous
at<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.040> time<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:53.460> didn't<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.730> how<00:00:53.880> to<00:00:53.940> get

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
at the time but I didn't know how to get

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
at the time but I didn't know how to get
back<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> figured<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.400> a<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
back so I kind of figured out a way to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.810 
back so I kind of figured out a way to
play<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.860> standard<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.579> wouldn't

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
play and just standard so I wouldn't

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.420 
play and just standard so I wouldn't
have<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> retune<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
have to retune it so one thing that that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.009 
have to retune it so one thing that that
I<00:01:02.460> noticed<00:01:02.850> initially<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.630> when<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> was

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I noticed initially was that when I was

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.600 
I noticed initially was that when I was
playing<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.379> G<00:01:04.619> chord<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.570> had<00:01:06.570> these<00:01:07.610> open

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
playing a G chord I had these open

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.020 
playing a G chord I had these open
strings<00:01:08.940> hear<00:01:10.250> someone<00:01:11.250> say<00:01:11.400> no<00:01:11.550> that's<00:01:11.760> kind

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
strings hear someone say no that's kind

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
strings hear someone say no that's kind
of<00:01:12.170> that's<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.440> of<00:01:13.500> interesting<00:01:13.740> I've<00:01:14.100> got

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
of that's kind of interesting I've got

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
of that's kind of interesting I've got
these<00:01:14.390> open<00:01:15.390> strings<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.350> just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
these open strings here so I can just

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.870 
these open strings here so I can just
play<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> G<00:01:17.360> like<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:19.049> even<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
play a G like this I don't even have to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.039 
play a G like this I don't even have to
touch<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.940> with<00:01:21.150> my<00:01:21.180> hand<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.900> play

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the D G and B strings and then create a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.110

this<00:01:28.020> riff<00:01:28.200> from<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> beginning<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this riff from the beginning of the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.990 
this riff from the beginning of the
styling<00:01:29.670> song<00:01:34.130> that's<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> G<00:01:35.580> over<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
styling song that's just a G over and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.899 
styling song that's just a G over and
over<00:01:36.090> again<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.630> open<00:01:37.020> strings<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.909> so

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
over again but with open strings and so

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760 
over again but with open strings and so
I<00:01:39.150> kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.780> mind<00:01:39.990> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.260> said<00:01:40.440> boom<00:01:40.619> well

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I kind of my mind kind of said boom well

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
I kind of my mind kind of said boom well
that's<00:01:40.950> very<00:01:41.010> interesting<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.080> how<00:01:43.080> can

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that's very interesting and how can

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
that's very interesting and how can
happen<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.560> how<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.920> apply<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.700> slide

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
happen but how can I apply this to slide

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.600 
happen but how can I apply this to slide
well<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> thought<00:01:46.409> was<00:01:46.619> well<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
well what I thought was well when I

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.429 
well what I thought was well when I
playing<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.939> slot<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.689> bar<00:01:49.020> straight

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
playing a slot I can just bar straight

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.780 
playing a slot I can just bar straight
across<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> only<00:01:50.490> thing<00:01:50.610> I've<00:01:50.760> got

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
across that's the only thing I've got

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
across that's the only thing I've got
and<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> little<00:01:52.770> off-putting

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and so that was a little off-putting

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.090 
and so that was a little off-putting
then<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.549> remembered<00:01:53.939> oh<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.299> G<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.740> open

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
then I remembered oh this G is just open

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.430 
then I remembered oh this G is just open
so<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> play<00:01:57.509> an<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.810> chord

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.920 

if<00:02:01.440> I<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.830> play<00:02:02.040> those<00:02:02.250> same<00:02:02.520> three<00:02:03.420> strings

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
if I just play those same three strings

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.140 
if I just play those same three strings
it<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.470> create<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> chord

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
it will create an a chord

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.450 
it will create an a chord
so<00:02:07.810> on<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.649> second<00:02:09.040> fret<00:02:10.860> i'm<00:02:11.860> creating<00:02:12.250> an<00:02:12.340> a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
so on the second fret i'm creating an a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.760 
so on the second fret i'm creating an a
chord<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> same<00:02:14.380> thing<00:02:14.620> will

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
chord and so the same thing will

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.070 
chord and so the same thing will
continue<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.280> fly<00:02:15.520> be<00:02:16.210> applied<00:02:16.510> all<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.960> way

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
continue to fly be applied all the way

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:25.380 
continue to fly be applied all the way
up<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> neck<00:02:17.320> soca<00:02:18.450> me<00:02:20.130> see<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:22.630> F<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.700> G<00:02:25.120> so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
up the neck soca me see the F and G so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.000 
up the neck soca me see the F and G so
I've<00:02:25.510> got<00:02:25.660> all<00:02:25.840> these<00:02:26.020> major<00:02:26.320> chords<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
can play on just the D G and B strings

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.480 
can play on just the D G and B strings
using<00:02:31.180> my<00:02:31.450> slide<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.800> started<00:02:32.950> applying

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
using my slide and so I started applying

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.640 
using my slide and so I started applying
that<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.790> all<00:02:33.940> these<00:02:34.090> different<00:02:34.300> songs<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.110> it

that to all these different songs and it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.050 
that to all these different songs and it
actually<00:02:35.770> worked<00:02:36.130> out<00:02:36.250> pretty<00:02:36.430> well<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.790> was

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
actually worked out pretty well I was

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.910 
actually worked out pretty well I was
able<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.360> play<00:02:37.480> some<00:02:37.780> some<00:02:38.050> old<00:02:38.320> blues<00:02:38.590> songs

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
able to play some some old blues songs

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.490 
able to play some some old blues songs
like<00:02:39.270> for<00:02:40.270> instance<00:02:40.330> there's<00:02:41.230> one<00:02:41.380> called

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500

Little<00:02:41.830> Red<00:02:41.950> Rooster<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.610> like<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.970> show

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
Little Red Rooster that I like to show

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.030 
Little Red Rooster that I like to show
people<00:02:43.510> at<00:02:44.110> first<00:02:44.410> which<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.830> kind<00:02:45.010> of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
people at first which just kind of

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:59.040 
people at first which just kind of
sounds<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:58.300> again<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.720> was<00:02:58.870> just

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
sounds like this and again that was just

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.740 
sounds like this and again that was just
me<00:02:59.170> playing<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.530> D<00:02:59.800> G<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.670> B<00:03:00.700> strings<00:03:01.270> so<00:03:01.630> it's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
me playing the D G and B strings so it's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.120 
me playing the D G and B strings so it's
kind<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.930> an<00:03:02.050> easier<00:03:02.350> way<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.530> play<00:03:02.830> some<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
kind of an easier way to play some of

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.850 
kind of an easier way to play some of
those<00:03:03.250> old<00:03:03.870> blues<00:03:04.870> songs<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.440> may<00:03:05.560> have<00:03:05.680> heard

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
those old blues songs you may have heard

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.710 
those old blues songs you may have heard
but<00:03:06.640> then<00:03:06.790> something<00:03:07.030> else<00:03:07.209> happened<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:07.630> was

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
but then something else happened I was

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.930 
but then something else happened I was
thinking<00:03:07.990> well<00:03:08.380> what<00:03:08.920> happens<00:03:09.400> if<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.700> need<00:03:09.850> to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
thinking well what happens if I need to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.210 
thinking well what happens if I need to
play<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.180> minor<00:03:10.540> chord<00:03:10.930> because<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.530> was<00:03:11.680> this

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
play a minor chord because that was this

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.940

was<00:03:12.400> all<00:03:12.519> based<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.000> G<00:03:13.269> major<00:03:13.570> so<00:03:14.560> then<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.800> was

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
was all based on a G major so then I was

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.240 
was all based on a G major so then I was
applying<00:03:15.580> some<00:03:15.940> e<00:03:16.180> minor<00:03:16.959> or<00:03:17.500> some<00:03:17.830> some

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
applying some e minor or some some

applying some e minor or some some
various<00:03:18.760> minor<00:03:19.000> chords<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.930> came<00:03:20.140> across<00:03:20.170> a

various minor chords and I came across a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.830 
various minor chords and I came across a
minor<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:21.100> was<00:03:21.220> thinking<00:03:21.340> oh<00:03:21.580> well<00:03:21.970> look<00:03:22.150> I've

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
well that with the gia kind of work Rob

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.160 
well that with the gia kind of work Rob
is<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.070> playing<00:03:33.400> across<00:03:33.700> my<00:03:33.970> D<00:03:34.030> G<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.140> B

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
is just playing across my D G and B

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.870 
is just playing across my D G and B
strings<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:35.830> order<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.100> get<00:03:36.250> major<00:03:36.430> chords<00:03:36.790> so

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
strings in order to get major chords so

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.259 
strings in order to get major chords so
maybe<00:03:37.090> if<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:37.360> play<00:03:37.690> across<00:03:37.930> my<00:03:38.290> G<00:03:39.070> B<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.090> E

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
maybe if I just play across my G B and E

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.800 
maybe if I just play across my G B and E
strings<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:41.019> would<00:03:41.170> work<00:03:41.350> for<00:03:41.680> minor<00:03:42.010> chords

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
strings it would work for minor chords

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.470 
strings it would work for minor chords
so<00:03:43.810> here<00:03:43.989> let's<00:03:44.170> let's<00:03:44.410> see<00:03:45.310> nonsense<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.269> if<00:03:46.390> I

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
so here let's let's see nonsense so if I

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.400 
so here let's let's see nonsense so if I
was<00:03:46.600> going<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.780> play<00:03:46.900> an<00:03:47.110> a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.590 

if<00:03:54.410> I<00:03:54.530> just<00:03:54.739> fight<00:03:54.890> across<00:03:55.040> those<00:03:55.280> strings

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
if I just fight across those strings

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.060 
if I just fight across those strings
I<00:03:56.690> get<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.680> minor<00:03:57.980> tonality<00:03:58.340> and<00:04:00.070> again

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
I get that a minor tonality and again

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.540 
I get that a minor tonality and again
that<00:04:01.220> will<00:04:01.310> work<00:04:01.490> all<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.240> way<00:04:02.270> up<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:03.290> neck

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
that will work all the way up the neck

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.130 
that will work all the way up the neck
so<00:04:04.550> just<00:04:04.820> using<00:04:05.090> these<00:04:05.180> open<00:04:05.540> strings<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:05.990> can

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
so just using these open strings I can
